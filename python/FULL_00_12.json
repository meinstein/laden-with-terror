'There's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man,' Mr. Bush said. 'We're watching him very carefully.'

At the same time, they said, he has tried to avoid the appearance that he was making those pledges as a way of appeasing Osama bin Laden.","1009":"A front-page article on Wednesday about the possibility of action by the United States against terrorist groups in the Philippines and Indonesia misidentified the leader of Abu Sayyaf, an organization tied to Osama bin Laden that operates from the Philippines.

Nonetheless this highly unorthodox view is finding some support in the Muslim world. This is an excerpt from an article by Muhammad Ishrat Husain, a retired accountant, that appeared on Oct. 5 in the opinion section of Dawn (www.dawn.com), the largest English-language newspaper in Pakistan.

'We know that he has over the years tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction, both biological and chemical weapons,' he said.

In the United States, the 'war against terrorism' is described as a duel between good and evil. But most of the protesters are working from a much different set of premises.

The list included a prominent Saudi businessman, adding to pressure on the reluctant Saudi royalty to take stiffer measures against financiers in their country.","103":"A former sergeant in the United States Army has directly linked Osama bin Laden for the first time to the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998. The link came as the former sergeant, Ali A.

They were eager for retribution against Osama bin Laden but unhappy with the bombing of Afghanistan. They considered themselves devout Muslims even as their brethren overseas branded them infidels.","1031":"As the seventh day of the air assault unfolded with raids on Kabul and Kandahar, Taliban leaders rejected Mr. Bush's offer on Thursday to consider halting the attacks if they handed over Osama bin Laden, promising to fight to their last breath.

Since they met two years ago, Colby had been 'receiving an introduction' to Karim's culture, and sometimes it seemed as if there were too many bridges to cross: strange misunderstandings, parts of his behavior he refused to explain. Now Karim and his friends plainly laid out the ways irrational violence affects civilian life. Colby was grateful to listen. One of Karim's friends, she told me, had met Osama bin Laden in Lebanon.","104":"MR. MOHAMED -- Your honor, in the early 1980's I became involved with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization. In the early 1990's, I was introduced to Al Qaeda -- Al Qaeda is the organization headed by Osama bin Laden -- through my involvement with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.","1040":"President Bush declared war on terrorism the day that hijackers slammed commercial airliners into the trade center and the Pentagon, killing more than 5,000 people. But the actual military response, by American and British forces, did not begin until a week ago, Oct. 7. Bombers, fighter planes and Tomahawk cruise missiles pounded terrorist camps run by Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and knocked out the airfields and other military strongholds of his Taliban protectors. Within a couple of days, the Americans were able to claim that they basically controlled the Afghan skies, though Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said on Friday that not all of the Taliban's air-defense capabilities had been knocked out.","1041":"Summon all the healthy skepticism rightfully applied to a story involving Osama bin Laden and a Muppet.

The White House called it propaganda. Page B1.","1043":"American strategy in the Middle East has long relied on Egypt as a moderating force, particularly in the conflict with Israel, and Saudi Arabia as a stabilizing influence on the weak tribal regimes of the Persian Gulf, which control oil riches. Washington's appeal now would seem to be tailor-made for them. The Egyptians have known terrorism first hand -- President Hosni Mubarak was the target of an assassination attempt by Islamic militants in 1995. His predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was killed by them in 1981. The Saudi royal family, whose power rests on its claim to religious piety, has endured Osama bin Laden's charge of being unfit to oversee the holy places of Mecca and Medina.","1044":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 13\u2014 Senior Saudi officials rejected today American accusations that the kingdom is not choking off the money supply to Osama bin Laden, accusing Washington of again leveling charges against groups or individuals here without providing any proof.","1045":"Taliban leaders rejected today President Bush's offer of a second chance to surrender Osama bin Laden and stop the week-long bombing.","1046":"BOSTON\u2014 These events have split the whole world into two camps: the camp of belief and the camp of disbelief,' Osama bin Laden said in his speech televised on the day America started bombing Afghanistan. And he left no doubt about the beliefs to which those in the first camp must adhere. 'There is only one God,' Mr. bin Laden told his listeners. 'And I declare that there is no prophet but Muhammad.'","1047":"That sympathizers of Osama bin Laden sink three oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz and choke off the narrow, bow-shaped channel that funnels 14 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. That the United States attacks Iraq, and Israel launches a huge strike against the Palestinians, driving them from their camps and staking out more land -- all of which spurs the Persian Gulf states to cut off oil for the West. Or perhaps that a popular uprising, led by sympathizers of Mr. bin Laden, topples the ruling Saud family in Saudi Arabia, by far the world's largest oil producer.","1048":"Cafepress.com, which helps companies sell merchandise on the Web, has over 200,000 clients.

On Arabic television, a Kuwaiti spokesman for Osama bin Laden issued a blistering threat to kill Westerners.","1051":"The allies' military tactics and political statements make clear that the United States intends to remove the Taliban, which it accuses of harboring Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network. Steps are under way to usher in a broad-based government under the temporary stewardship of the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah.","1052":"Officials say an even smaller number are followers of Osama bin Laden whose arrests may have disrupted other terror plots being planned. However, officials acknowledge that the evidence of other terror operations remains circumstantial.","1053":"Accordingly, Mr. Martens altered the class outline, focusing much more on Osama bin Laden, the terrorist group Al Qaeda and the Middle East in general. He explained patterns in terrorists' motivations and behaviors, drawing parallels between Mr. bin Laden and domestic terrorists including Timothy McVeigh and the Ku Klux Klan.","1054":"The storytellers no longer come. There is just one story now, at least one acceptable story. It is the one taught in the seminaries, called madrassas, that have become incubators in Pakistan for the holy warriors who say they will die to defend Islam and their hero, Osama bin Laden, from the infidels. In many of the 7,500 madrassas in Pakistan, inside a student body of 750,000 to a million, students learn to recite and obey Islamic law, and to distrust and even hate the United States.","1055":"The largesse has come raining down with the ordnance because this war is at least partly about Afghanistan's extreme poverty. Once solely a matter of moral concern, the nation's destitution has become a security threat because it has helped create a fertile recruiting ground -- and a compliant host -- for Osama bin Laden.","1056":"The United States rained bombs on Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden promised holy war. The F.B.I. warned of new terrorist attacks in the United States. And an anthrax scare spread from Florida to Manhattan. The stock market, however, showed some spunk.","1058":"A MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE -- The Central Intelligence Agency intercepted a cryptic but chilling message last year from a member of Al Qaeda, who boasted that Osama bin Laden was planning to carry out a 'Hiroshima' against America, according to government officials. Still, officials acknowledged they failed to grasp the organization's transformation from an obscure group of Islamic extremists into the world's most dangerous terrorists. A1","1059":"And while we're at it, perhaps we could take the time to change the way we use another word: 'revolutionary.' Look, a gadget isn't revolutionary if it locates the position of your car on Earth. It would be revolutionary if it located Osama bin Laden, then compiled a legal case against him.","106":"These facts have centered attention on Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi Arabian financier from a family with origins in Hadhramaut, who is accused of terrorism. Mr. bin Laden, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is known to have issued threats against American targets that were broadcast in a videotape shown on a Middle East television channel only last month.","1060":"Before Sept. 11, Mr. Hijazi, 32, was already a prisoner of the first order: a man accused of leading a cell of terrorists in Jordan connected to Osama bin Laden. The foiled plot: to kill Americans here by blowing up a big hotel and several holy sites.","1061":"The Central Intelligence Agency intercepted a cryptic but chilling message last year from a member of Al Qaeda, who boasted that Osama bin Laden was planning to carry out a 'Hiroshima' against America, according to government officials.","1062":"Nine months earlier, he had been identified to American intelligence agents as one of Osama bin Laden's operatives in the United States. American customs agents knew about money he had transferred to an associate of Osama bin Laden in the Middle East. And the Boston police had issued a warrant for his arrest after he violated probation for stabbing a friend with a knife.","1063":"Moments of international crisis have a way of stripping away diplomatic facades and exposing uncomfortable truths. One of the disturbing realities clarified by last month's terror attacks is Saudi Arabia's tolerance for terrorism. Students of America's deeply cynical relationship with Riyadh have long known that the kingdom did little to discourage Islamic extremists, as long as they operated outside its borders, and that Washington muted its objections to keep oil flowing to the West. It is now clear that the Saudi behavior was more malignant. With Riyadh's acquiescence, money and manpower from Saudi Arabia helped create and sustain Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization.","1064":"'It depends how you define the war,' said Joseph S. Nye, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a former assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration. 'If you define it as getting rid of Osama bin Laden or disrupting Al Qaeda, you can have measures of success. But that's not victory in the war on terrorism, that's victory against a particular objective.'","1065":"Unlike Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mughniyah is the ultimate faceless terrorist. Sometimes described as a senior intelligence officer of Hezbollah and sometimes as the group's operations chief or security chief, he is thought to be the mastermind behind many deadly attacks on American targets overseas that have involved hijackings and the taking of hostages.","1066":"Toward the end of the editorial, Uncle Sam is seen pointing elsewhere: 'He's pointing at you, Osama bin Laden, and every other organization that spends its entire existence trying to buy what can't be bought and break what cannot be broken.'","1067":"There are plenty of ideas across the United States about what to do in this campaign. As in the great ideological battles of the past, most recently the cold war, America is looking to frame the struggle in its own terms. But as the broad appeal of the videotaped message by Osama bin Laden made clear, the Al Qaeda terrorist network of Mr. bin Laden is already seeking to set the terms of the debate to serve its own interests and turn the Islamic world against the United States.","1069":"I truly don't understand those who are opposed to the American military action in Afghanistan. People can argue back and forth about what Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda want, but actions speak louder than words.","107":"At a briefing, the officials insisted that they were far away from being able to recommend possible targets for a retaliatory American military strike of the kind hinted at by President Clinton, who vowed after the Cole attack that those responsible would be held 'accountable' and allowed 'no safe harbor.' After the terrorist bombings of two American embassies in east Africa in August, 1998, Mr. Clinton ordered Navy cruise missile strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, saying that an American investigation had identified Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian exile and Islamic militant living in Afghanistan as the prime figure in the attacks.","1070":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates\u2014 Officials of the United Arab Emirates are examining the country's banking practices after government investigators said they believed that they were used by a paymaster for Osama bin Laden as a transfer point for bankrolling the hijackers who attacked the United States.","1071":"But while the United States has pursued Osama bin Laden and sought to neutralize the Taliban that shelters him, the behind-the-scenes effort to organize a leadership that would replace Taliban leaders has made no discernible progress.","1072":"During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the helicopter-borne troops of the 101st Airborne were among the first to go. This time, although the 101st Airborne is on alert, it has not received orders to deploy. Instead, smaller specialized units based at Fort Campbell, the Fifth Special Forces and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers, seem to be sending some of their highly trained soldiers in the search for Osama bin Laden.","1073":"'They are innocent people living here,' said one villager, Gul Mohammed. 'There is no military base. What is it they are looking for in Afghanistan? Where is Osama bin Laden? He is not here. Why did they bomb us?'","1074":"Kandahar in southern Afghanistan is the Taliban's spiritual stronghold, the place where they are expected to make their last stand, if it comes to that. It also was a home of Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the attacks that killed nearly 6,000 people in the United States last month.","1075":"Angie W. Sherry, a member who is a lawyer, said she had written to a local principal seeking help for another member whose son was enduring taunts from boys at his school that he looked 'like Osama' -- a reference to Osama bin Laden.

The government expressed the same concern brought up by the Bush administration last week when it sought agreement from American networks for delaying or limiting transmission -- that the comments could contain coded messages to bin Laden operatives in other countries.","1078":"Instead of bombing targets in Afghanistan, these students suggest prosecuting Osama bin Laden and other terrorism suspects through an international war tribunal. They fault the United States sanctions against Iraq and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Western economic policies throughout the third world, for inciting anti-American hatred.","1079":"Who did it? The timing, and the continuing threats from Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, make that group an easy suspect. In an appearance on Friday on the PBS program, 'The News Hour with Jim Lehrer,' Vice President Dick Cheney noted that Mr. bin Laden's group trained its followers to use chemical and biological weapons. Implying a link between Mr. bin Laden and the anthrax incidents, he said, 'Again, we have not completed the investigation and maybe it's a coincidence, but I must say I'm a skeptic.'","108":"When a top deputy to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected by the authorities of masterminding the bombings of two United States embassies in East Africa in 1998, pleaded guilty on Friday to terrorism conspiracy charges, the news caught many people by surprise.","1080":"AFTER THE TALIBAN -- One week after the bombs started falling on Afghanistan, the United States military campaign has run ahead of Washington's political strategy to install a new regime in Kabul.

It could be somebody holding a grudge.'","1088":"When the White House suggested that five major United States television news organizations use caution before airing raw video statements from Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda followers last week, government officials said Mr. bin Laden's statements could include hidden messages to terrorists.","1089":"The program's format was numbingly familiar -- four suits shouting. But the language was Arabic, the subject was the morality of terror and the channel was Al Jazeera, the satellite channel that infuriated the White House last week by playing a tape of Osama bin Laden.","109":"Administration officials said they see enough similarities between the Cole attack in the port of Aden and the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998, which have been blamed on Al Qaeda, the group headed by the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden, to warrant taking this precaution against a second or third attack. Multiple attacks have been a hallmark of the group.","1090":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 14\u2014 President Bush forcefully rejected another offer from the Taliban today to begin talks about the surrender of Osama bin Laden if the United States stopped bombing Afghanistan.","1091":"There were no posters of Osama bin Laden or any overt references to the United States at the funeral. When asked about Mr. Bin Laden, Wajeeh Qawas, a Hamas leader who addressed the crowd by microphone from the back of a truck, condemned the terrorist attacks on the United States. 'Our people don't hate America, but they hate the unjust policies of America,' he said. 'And they look to Osama bin Laden not as an individual but as someone who is opposing U.S. policies.'","1092":"A BUSH REBUFF -- President Bush's offer last week to reconsider the bombing if the Taliban surrendered Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants brought about another exchange yesterday. The second-in-command of the Taliban, Maulvi Abdul Kabir, said Mr. bin Laden could be handed over to a third country if the United States showed evidence that he was responsible for terrorism.","1094":"On the military front, 10 days of bombing and missile attacks on Afghanistan appeared to be achieving their desired effect. A senior Taliban official surfaced in Pakistan appealing for a pause in the raids to allow moderate Taliban leaders to persuade Mullah Muhammad Omar, the hard-line supreme chief, to surrender Osama bin Laden.","1095":"Asked about reports that the United States was tying to bomb Mullah Omar, Defense Secretary Donald H.

Some have come to see in Osama bin Laden, the man America is trying to bomb into submission, as a savior.","1109":"In Washington, top law enforcement and health officials until today played down possible links between the anthrax cases and Osama bin Laden's terror network. Then, as a new letter appeared in the office of the Senate majority leader, they abruptly acknowledged that such a link is now at the center of their investigation into who is behind the anthrax attacks.","111":"The government has described Mr. El-Hage as a close associate of and former personal secretary to Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi financier who has been accused of leading a terrorism conspiracy that included the August 1998 attacks on two United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The nearly simultaneous blasts killed more than 200 people and injured thousands.","1110":"To listen to Saudi officials, or read the Arab press, you would never know that most of the hijackers were young Saudis, or that the main financing for Osama bin Laden -- a Saudi -- has been coming from other wealthy Saudis, or that Saudi Arabia's government was the main funder of the Taliban. No, to listen to them you would think that all these young men had virgin births: they came from nowhere, no society is responsible for them, and no Arab state need reflect on how perpetrators of such a grotesque act could have come from its womb.","1111":"Mr. Arafat reiterated his condemnation of the attacks. In answer to a question as to why Osama bin Laden was wrong to have called on all Muslims to rise up in defense of the Palestinian cause, Mr. Arafat said: 'What I have said is very, very clear. Islam as a religion prevents anyone, forbids anyone to harm any civilians, any innocent people around the world.'","1112":"CNN has asked Osama bin Laden whether he or his followers have weapons of mass destruction and whether they plan to use them, the network said last night.","1113":"BRUSSELS, Oct. 16\u2014 American investigators say that the Belgian authorities have denied them access to suspects and evidence in their inquiry into the European network linked to Osama bin Laden and a thwarted plot to blow up the American Embassy in Paris.","1114":"General Musharraf deserves American support for his willingness to help in the campaign against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. That does not mean he should be given a free hand to support Islamic fundamentalist extremists in Kashmir, the northern Indian state where a Muslim uprising has been raging for years. Pakistan needs to stop supporting guerrilla fighters in the conflict. India must understand that it cannot crush Muslim aspirations in Kashmir with the use of force.","1115":"CNN said it had agreed to submit questions to Osama bin Laden, putting the network in a potentially uncomfortable position. PAGE B9","1116":"Isolated for several years, a onetime shelter for the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, Sudan has begun opening itself up in the last two. Canadian and European oil workers now form a small though visible group of foreign nationals here, in addition to the Chinese and Malaysians.","1117":"Osama bin Laden had already made women in New York and Washington rethink wearing high heels and skirts to the office, in case they have to clamber through wreckage. Now anthrax terrorism is forcing us to wear rubber gloves and surgical masks if we want to open our mail.","1118":"That having been said, the number of confirmed anthrax cases remained only four -- two in Florida and two in New York. Who is responsible for these attacks was still not clear, though government officials said again that they could not rule out a connection to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks believed to have been orchestrated by Osama bin Laden.","1119":"Leadership targets have been a principal focus. The United States has been making a determined effort to bomb Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme leader of the Taliban and an ally of the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. Many of the strikes have been concentrated in and around Kandahar, the Taliban's political base.","112":"Wadih El-Hage, described as a former aide to Osama bin Laden, asked to plead guilty to charges involving the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa, but the judge rejected the plea. B1","1120":"Nor is it clear whether Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network, was involved in any way. American intelligence officials say Mr. bin Laden has tried to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.","1121":"The official said the letters contained phrases like 'Death to America,' 'You're going to die' and 'Allah is great.' Investigators did not conclude that the reference to Allah meant that the letter writer was an Islamic extremist or linked to Osama bin Laden, the official said. But officials today refused to rule out any possible motive for the letters.","1122":"According to a federal indictment handed up in 1998, Osama bin Laden set up a headquarters for Al Qaeda in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, in 1991, together with numerous companies intended to 'provide income and support' for the terrorist network. The indictment also said Al Qaeda had forged alliances with the National Islamic Front, the ruling party in Sudan.","1123":"The agreement was the most visible achievement of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit here today as bombs continued to fall in Afghanistan on Taliban troop concentrations and on targets associated with Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden.","1124":"Last week, for example, the White House urged American television networks and newspapers to 'exercise judgment' and drastically curtail publishing or broadcasting 'propaganda,' including possibly 'coded messages,' from Osama bin Laden. Unspoken was the dangerous implication that the press was, perhaps unwittingly, playing into the enemy's hands. Within hours, fearing a public backlash, network executives promised more judicious editing in the future. None wanted to be seen as refusing to cooperate with the administration's crusade against terrorism.","1125":"Mr. Rumsfeld became the latest senior Bush administration official to grant an interview to Al Jazeera, the television network in Qatar, which has angered American officials by broadcasting tapes made by Osama bin Laden.","1126":"QUESTIONS FOR BIN LADEN: CNN announced that it had submitted six written questions to Osama bin Laden through a man who claimed to be a representative of Al Qaeda. B9","1127":"There are three pieces in 'Fire,' Sebastian Junger's uneven and decidedly dated collection of nonfiction, that are of particular interest right now, given the war in Afghanistan and the heroic efforts of New York City firefighters to rescue people trapped in the World Trade Center. The first two deal with the dangerous work of firefighting, though Mr. Junger focuses on wildfires in the American West rather than the urban variety. The third (published in National Geographic Adventure last spring as a sort of prelude to the recently broadcast television program 'National Geographic Explorer') chronicles the author's travels with the anti-Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan a year or so ago, and contains a brief but compelling portrait of Gen. Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance's longtime military leader, who was assassinated last month by agents reportedly linked to Osama bin Laden.","1128":"In the case of Hitler, or Osama bin Laden, the line between explaining and excusing should be apparent to all. So the last thing we should want is to inhibit professors and teachers from exploring Islamic fundamentalism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the politics of oil, the role of authoritarianism in the Persian Gulf region, how American mass culture is marketed internationally or anything else that might help to understand and prevent recurring terrorism.","1129":"In assessing the military situation, Dr. Abdullah said the American airstrikes had killed hundreds of Taliban troops and rendered the Taliban incapable of beginning offensive military operations. A recent strike on Kabul, he said, killed about 15 followers of Osama bin Laden. None of those reports could be independently verified.","113":"American terrorism experts here said Mr. Saleh appeared to be referring to a group known as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, one of the deadliest in a network of Islamic terrorist organizations in the Middle East, Europe and North America. It has been linked to the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 and to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding the bombings of two United States embassies in Africa in 1998.","1130":"The four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- were found guilty in May of joining with Osama bin Laden in a global terrorist conspiracy that included the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998. The government is working hard to make sure that when the court imposes punishment on the men tomorrow, no punishment is meted out, in return, by terrorists on the court.","1131":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: \u201c\u2018Propaganda\u2019 can be defined as \u2018ideas that are deliberately spread to benefit a particular cause or to damage an opposing one.\u2019 What examples can you name, both in history and currently, of both types of propaganda?\u201d After five minutes, have students to share responses, making a list of examples on the board under two columns titled \u201cBenefit\u201d and \u201cDamage.\u201d Then, explore how the term \u201cpropaganda\u201d is used in everyday language, typically carrying a derogatory or negative connotation. Do students think propaganda can ever be discussed or represented in a positive light? Why or why not? 2. As a class, read and discuss the article \u201cU.S. Steps Up Leaflets and Radio Broadcasts to Sway Afghans,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. What does this article refer to as \u2018Washington\u2019s latest weapon against the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan\u201d? b. How many leaflets were distributed on Sunday, October 14, 2001 in Afghanistan, and how were they distributed? c. According to the article, what do the United States-distributed leaflets look like, and what information do they contain? d. What were some messages the United States Department of Defense broadcast via radio to the people of Afghanistan? e. What is meant by the term \u201cpropaganda war\u201d? f. How do supporters of Osama bin Laden portray the bombing of Afghanistan, according to the article? g. What was United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s assessment of the current \u201cpropaganda war,\u201d according to the article? h. Who is Condoleeza Rice, and what did she do to address the topic of propaganda in the Arabic-speaking world? 3. Divide students into small groups. Explain to students that they will be searching for examples of the two categories of propaganda (\u201cbenefiting a cause\u201d and \u201cdamaging an opposing cause\u201d) presented in the print media since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Examples of propaganda should be from around the world (including the United States, as explored in this article), and should include both textual and visual examples (such as quotations, excerpts of speeches, and photographs). Students should use all available classroom resources provided and cut out examples as they find them. It will be important to help students keep in mind that this lesson is about propaganda and its functions, not about political perspectives or \u201csides.\u201d After about twenty minutes, give each group two pieces of poster board or construction paper and a glue stick, and have them create collages of their collected words and images. On one piece of paper, students should collage their items that represent \u201cbenefiting a cause.\u201d On the other, they should collage their items that represent \u201cdamaging an opposing cause.\u201d 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups complete their posters and post them in two areas of the classroom depending on the type of propaganda explored. At home, each student synthesizes her understanding of propaganda by writing a brief essay about the pros and cons of propaganda in wartime. Essays can be shared or posted in a future class.","1132":"The Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has embraced the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi and condemned Zionism, said President Bush should make public the evidence that Osama bin Laden was involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 'The nation would be more secure if you give the American people a reason to fight,' Mr. Farrakhan said.","1133":"President Bush was wrong not to negotiate with the Taliban over Osama bin Laden. If he has substantial evidence against Osama bin Laden, why not negotiate? Is this not a part of seeking justice? Or does Mr. Bush believe that striking Afghanistan and killing innocent people is O.K. in the name of foreign policy?","1134":"Mr. Putin has moved aggressively since Sept. 11 to help Washington. Among other things, he has encouraged former Soviet republics in Central Asia like Uzbekistan to open their bases to American troops and planes. In return Mr. Putin has tried to get Washington to mute criticism of Russia's handling of Chechnya, something Mr. Bush should resist. More reasonably, Moscow is pressing Washington to slow its haste to discard the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. If the two countries can cooperate so closely against Osama bin Laden, they should be able to work out ways to amend the treaty to permit reasonable limited missile defenses.","1135":"The Taliban request that the United States halt the bombings so that negotiations can take place to discuss a turnover of Osama bin Laden (front page, Oct. 16) is a clever ploy to allow him to escape from Afghanistan without fear of being a casualty of American firepower. And the Taliban obviously believe that after he escapes, the United States will no longer have reason to bomb their country.","1136":"Four convicted terrorists with ties to Osama bin Laden will be ordered to pay restitution to victims of the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa, a federal judge in Manhattan said yesterday. Lawyers put the figure at roughly $33 million.","1137":"It appeared once again today that American military planners were worried that bombing the Taliban front-line positions here, just 35 miles north of Kabul, would open the door for Northern Alliance forces to take the Afghan capital. Pakistan, a vital American ally in the campaign against Osama bin Laden's network in Afghanistan, is strongly opposed to any move on Kabul by the alliance.","1138":"The Taliban also gave refuge to Osama bin Laden when he had to leave Sudan, welcoming him as a comrade from the struggle against Soviet forces and as a Muslim hero.","1139":"President Bush has been seeking to reward Mr. Arafat for his statements repudiating Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on America and for lending some support to the American-led antiterror coalition.","114":"Yemen's president said one of the two men who bombed the destroyer Cole was an Egyptian from a group tied to Osama bin Laden. PAGE A20","1140":"It is an example that is made more troubling to Uzbeks because the Taliban and Osama bin Laden have supported the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a group of insurgents who have infiltrated the countryside during recent summers and vowed to overthrow President Islam A. Karimov. The movement has pledged to govern the republic under its strict interpretation of Islamic law.","1141":"Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said that Osama bin Laden, his commanders and the leaders of the Taliban are all legitimate targets for United States strikes as part of the recognized right of selfdefense (front page, Oct. 16). They became targets because of their dispatch and support of terrorists who killed so many of our civilians on Sept. 11 and have done so on other occasions.","1142":"A CALL FOR EVIDENCE: The Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, said the president should reveal the evidence against Osama bin Laden. B10","1143":"KOTA BHARU, Malaysia, Oct. 18\u2014 Sahimah sells Islamic books, tapes and head scarves from her sidewalk kiosk here. But pride of place is reserved for a new arrival: T-shirts emblazoned with Osama bin Laden's face and the phrase 'Man of the World,' available in adult and children's sizes.","1144":"Mr. Putin's decision to align Russia with the fight against the bases of Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been hailed as a significant turn in Russia's post-cold-war policy toward the West. It has secured one immediate benefit for Russia: greater Western acceptance of the military campaign Mr. Putin is waging in the rebellious territory of Chechnya.","1145":"Al-Jazeera is the satellite station out of Qatar that broadcasts, free of government restrictions, all over the Arab world, putting on such a range of statesmen that it has infuriated everyone. The outfit annoyed President Bush last week by playing a tape of Osama bin Laden.","1146":"THE CALL TO ACTION -- Special forces units expected to begin their search for Osama bin Laden soon are quietly leaving their families, with no fanfare and amid as much secrecy as possible. B3","1147":"The four men who were sentenced yesterday in the embassy bombings conspiracy were all followers of Osama bin Laden. One of the men, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was also a sworn member of Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist organization, while another, Wadih El-Hage, was a close aide and former personal secretary.","1148":"In an interview today with the Cable News Network, Mr. Rumsfeld was asked about concerns that America 'might leave the Taliban in place and make them and Osama bin Laden even bigger heroes.'","1149":"As the air attacks on Taliban targets in Afghanistan have presumably softened the Taliban's air defenses, commando units are widely expected to begin their search for Osama bin Laden soon, and some of them will come from Fort Campbell, which is better known as the home of the 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles.","1150":"When they saw it, they knew: the attack on the World Trade Center was the work of Osama bin Laden. The two women said they had good reason to believe this. After all, they had sat through five months of testimony about Mr. bin Laden and his terrorist group as jurors in the embassy bombings trial.","1151":"These anti-Western views aid Osama bin Laden or other extremists in finding recruits, some Saudis believe, because they can mold the imperfectly formed religious creed of young, easily influenced men, convincing them that their faith condones violence against non-Muslims. Even Saudi Arabia's famous oil wealth -- Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, earned $80 billion last year -- has been no insurance against economic and political unrest.","1152":"First, we need to eliminate the Osama bin Ladens, who are dedicated to using any sharp instrument to super-empower themselves to do us harm. We will not get the backing of our Arab allies by winning an argument with them about the necessity of this war. We will win their backing and respect if we win the war and uproot bin Laden and the Taliban.","1153":"In the same way that many Islamic extremist crusades use the oppression of women to help them gain control over wider populations, the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are now employing the tactics of terrorism to gain control.","1154":"Four terrorists who were convicted in May of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa were sentenced yesterday to life in prison without any chance of release.","1155":"But did his promise, in Quetta, of a 'secret' plan mean that there was some new formula that would send Osama bin Laden and his associates into American hands?","1156":"Four days after federal officials moved to freeze the assets of several honey businesses in Yemen, saying they were tied to Osama bin Laden, two men were arrested at Kennedy Airport on charges that they tried to smuggle more than $100,000 in cash to Yemen in boxes of honey.","1157":"Clearly Osama bin Laden wants it to be a clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. The first priority for our government is to try to prevent it from becoming one. But there is a real danger that it could move in that direction. The administration has acted exactly the right way in attempting to rally support among Muslim governments and people. But there are great pressures here in the United States to attack other terrorist groups and states that support terrorist groups. And that, it seems to me, could broaden it into a clash of civilizations.","1158":"Ahmed Rashid's 'Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia,' although redundantly subtitled, is my favorite reference on the Taliban movement. Richly detailed, the book grows out of Rashid's more than two decades of reporting from the region. No book provides as much insight into the Taliban movement's rise and success, including chapters on its religious ideology, organizational structure, heroin economy, policies toward women and shadowy support for Osama bin Laden and the 'Arab Afghans.'","1159":"I am unsure why you insist that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel 'exercise restraint' when it comes to retaliation against Palestinian terrorism. No such demand is made of President Bush, who is exercising little to no restraint in his response to Osama bin Laden's terrorism. Why are these two strikingly parallel cases being treated so differently?","116":"As the Federal Bureau of Investigation completed its examination today of the Cole and shore sites possibly used by the bombers and began sending home some agents, American officials here and in Washington continued to say that they were not yet certain that the prime suspect in the case was Osama bin Laden, son of a billionaire Saudi Arabian construction magnate, who is accused of inspiring and directing a worldwide 'holy war' against the United States. But the officials remained cautious, saying proof had yet to be found.","1160":"Last month, American officials said they had received an unconfirmed report that Mr. Atta met with an Iraqi official last year. If that is found to be true, Iraq could be seen to have a role in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Some American officials would like to expand the assault on Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to include Iraq.","1161":"That version is called Wahhabism, although the Saudis are loath to use the term in referring to their proselytizing in this country. As practiced in Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism denies equal rights to women, and its teachings have inspired the violent extremism of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government that harbors him in Afghanistan.","1162":"Other government agencies have sent to banks lists of individuals and organizations with financial ties to Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden. The government has demanded that the financial institutions freeze the accounts of any name on those lists.","1163":"Mr. Midhar has become a major focus of the terror investigation because investigators suspect he also had roles in two previous acts of terrorism tied to Osama bin Laden, the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies and the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole.","1164":"Photo: Fresh off a Brazilian assembly line, masks of Osama bin Laden rest on a table at a factory in a suburb of Rio de Janeiro yesterday. In the background are dozens more masks of Yasir Arafat and President Bush. (Renzo Gostoli/Associated Press)","1165":"Some 15 young people in Ede made the national news when they were seen celebrating in the streets while making a V-sign for victory and calling Osama bin Laden 'our leader.' Teachers in some schools with primarily foreign students declared they did not observe the three minutes of silence in honor of victims.","1167":"'Attention, people of Afghanistan,' blared one warning, which was made public by the Pentagon. 'United States forces will be moving through your area. We are not here to harm you. We are here for Osama bin Laden and those that protect them! Please, for your own safety, stay off bridges and roadways and do not interfere with our troops or military operations.'","1168":"The anthrax scare has so dominated Americans' consciousness that it was almost possible for a while to overlook the war in Afghanistan. But the harsh reality of combat returned in a rush with the start of American ground operations in and around Kandahar, a city in southern Afghanistan where the Taliban rulers and Osama bin Laden's terrorist network are strongest.","1169":"The consensus among those leaders was that even widespread defections would not eliminate the need to send troops to Afghanistan to wipe out resistance and hunt Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda members.","117":"He was apparently referring to the group linked to the World Trade Center bombing and to Osama bin Laden, the much-hunted terrorist. Security was tightened for the American team in Aden after they received a bomb threat. Hubert B. Herring","1170":"While there is no proof that Mr. Ortega ever met him, one televised spot also shows Osama bin Laden among the rogues' gallery, while an announcer warns people, 'If they could vote in Nicaragua, they would vote for Daniel Ortega.'","1171":"It may be that Osama bin Laden's network and many others are built on similar principles. What if the network is designed so that if Mr. bin Laden were removed, the network would proceed unimpeded? What if the network is less hierarchical than it seems, so there are few if any agents with a complete overview of what is happening? Some people in intelligence have theorized that this was the case with some of the hijackers. How is this kind of network, a modified human version of the Internet, to be undermined, particularly given its intermeshing links with other terror networks with their own design?","1172":"Winning the military struggle against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban protectors, if and when we do, will not end the threat of terrorism against the United States. That will require, in the long run, something more difficult than military action: a profound effort by America and the West to ease the poverty and misery of the developing world.","1173":"The goals seem clear. The Pentagon is initially looking to destabilize and topple the Taliban leadership, first by bombing, now by pursuing individual leaders. The bigger target is Osama bin Laden and his followers. If Washington can get reliable intelligence about the movement of the terrorist leader -- information that is hard to acquire -- special forces may eventually be able to track him down.","1174":"Perhaps history will see the ultimate tragedy in what is happening today, with the arrival of Arab zealots, Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants. Their dominating presence in the Taliban's Afghanistan has brought down on Afhan heads an homes an American war, whose potential ripples could directly affect every land between the Mediterranean and the Ganges. Unhappily this time, Afghanistan again finds itself at the center of the world.","1175":"Osama bin Laden specifically invoked past Israeli attacks on Beit Jala, Jenin and Ramallah in his videotaped appeal for Muslim support broadcast on Oct. 7. The Israelis today occupied positions in Palestinian-controlled territory in two more West Bank cities, Qalqiliya and Tul Karm. Four Palestinians were killed in fighting in those two cities and four more were killed in fighting in the Bethlehem area.","1178":"Andrew Tyndall, who tracks the major networks' evening news programs, calculated that these programs, the showcases of the news departments of ABC, NBC and CBS, devoted a combined total of 84 minutes to the anthrax mailings between Oct. 15 and Oct. 18. Of all the aspects of the terrorism coverage, including the American bombing campaign in Afghanistan and the search for Osama bin Laden, only the initial coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks consumed more weekly broadcast time than did the combined evening news coverage of the anthrax scares last week. (A combined 333 minutes were devoted to the attacks on the three broadcasts in the week of Sept. 10.)","1179":"Senior government officials say they believe they have captured at least 10 members of Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, who may have been involved in cells planning other attacks. While there is no firm evidence of specific plots that have been thwarted, one senior law enforcement official said, 'We know we've changed the atmosphere.'","118":"Some dangers are concrete. Tajikistan fought a five-year civil war against Islamic insurgents that ended in 1997, leaving at least 50,000 dead. This summer, soldiers from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan battled 100 to 200 rebels from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. American officials say the group has ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan and to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier suspected of responsibility for terrorist attacks.","1180":"Sikhs are not Muslim. Indeed, through history they have often battled Muslim empires, but to confused Americans they resemble Osama bin Laden, and late one September night that is what a half-dozen thugs in East New York, Brooklyn, screamed at Parwinder Singh, smashing three windows in his taxi with beer bottles. After that, the mother said Parwinder must stop working. For days he stayed indoors, but it made him feel fearful and hopeless. He saw only one way out. He would wake one morning, ready to do it. Then, the next morning he could not; his father would feel disgraced, and the young man had been raised to respect his father like a god.","1181":"And while you're at it, picture Osama bin Laden in his boxers.","1182":"The crowd cheered as Jon Bon Jovi sang 'Dead Or Alive,' one of his hit songs from the 1980's and a phrase that President Bush has used in reference to the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attack, Osama bin Laden. Mick Jagger used a vulgar term to explain why it was best not to get into a fight with New York.","1183":"Most of the monks support the bombing in Afghanistan, Father Conner said, not as revenge, but as a way of capturing Osama bin Laden. 'You're allowed to pursue war if it's truly for the sake of self-defense,' he said.","1185":"As a postmodernist, I have had a very hard time dealing with life in New York City over the last month. I see flags everywhere and pictures of Osama bin Laden with his face shown in the cross hairs. I fear that if I speak up, I will be branded a traitor.","1186":"Persico has been over this ground before, notably in 'Piercing the Reich,' his history of an aggressive campaign by the Office of Strategic Services to put secret agents into Nazi-controlled territory in the last year of the war, and in his biography of William Casey, President Ronald Reagan's choice to run the Central Intelligence Agency. There Casey demonstrated the last flowering of the spirit he had learned at the knee of William Donovan, founder of the O.S.S., who would have been challenged to organize a dinner for four but ran a secret intelligence service willing to hazard any scheme, however harebrained it appeared to cooler eyes. What Casey gave Reagan was the Iran-contra scandal and an American-supported full-scale guerrilla war against Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The result was a Soviet retreat in 1989 followed, to our current sorrow, by the rise of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1187":"Q. And on Osama bin Laden?","1188":"So, too, have American support for Israel and for sanctions on Iraq, and the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. As a result, the message of the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden has gained a broad resonance.","1189":"Stanley Fish offers an interesting explanation of moral relativism ('Condemnation Without Absolutes,' Op-Ed, Oct. 15), but no major evildoer -- Pol Pot, Hitler, Jim Jones, Timothy McVeigh and now Osama bin Laden, if you like -- is a moral relativist who acknowledges that his own truth might not be more valid that other people's truths.","119":"American officials have said since early in the investigation that a prime suspect in the case is Osama bin Laden, the son of a Saudi Arabian construction tycoon who is living in hiding in Afghanistan and who is wanted by the F.B.I. on suspicion of masterminding the bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998.","1190":"In turn, the Bush administration has refrained from criticizing Saudi silence over the American-led counterattacks against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, nor has it spoken out about evidence that Saudi citizens finance Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and other radical Islamic organizations.","1191":"That code and kinship explain much of what is happening in this conflict, such as why the Taliban are reluctant to evict their guest, Osama bin Laden, who has asked them for a sanctuary they are honor-bound to give, and why even those Pakistanis who are not religious militants have joined in heated protests.","1192":"11 1 THE NEW JACKALS, by Simon Reeve. (Northeastern University, $26.95.) Tracking the career of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and his links to Osama bin Laden.","1193":"One aim of the American campaign is to topple the Taliban government and another, the primary objective, is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his top associates in Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization.","1194":"LONDON, Oct. 20\u2014 More than a month after the September terror attacks, the United States and its close allies are still intercepting communications among Osama bin Laden's associates and are convinced more attacks are coming, intelligence officials in several countries say.","1195":"At the B. Dalton bookstore in The Westchester mall, the display racks near the checkout counter are lined with books on germ warfare, Osama bin Laden and the New York City skyline. Next to a 'Halloween Hits' CD is the paperback version of 'The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook.'","1196":"Though virtually all the world's countries proclaimed support for the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, the bombing campaign to pry Osama bin Laden out of Afghanistan has touched an anti-American nerve across the Islamic world, providing new ammunition for radical groups from Pakistan to Indonesia. In the Middle East, Arab states with potent radical Islamic movements, like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, become more anxious every day the bombing continues.","1197":"Four terrorists convicted last spring of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa were sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan to life in prison without any chance of release. Two -- Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, who assisted in the bombing in Kenya, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 28, who helped in preparing the attack in Tanzania -- had earlier avoided the death penalty when the jury did not unanimously vote for execution. The two others were Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 41.","1198":"President Bush, in his demand that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden, said on Oct. 14 that 'we know he's guilty.' But Mr. Bush and other officials have suggested that they would place Mr. bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders on trial if they were captured alive.","1199":"THE ROAD TO KABUL -- The roar of the first wave of jets far overhead at 5 p.m. Afghan time yesterday was music to the ears of the Northern Alliance forces who have been held in the northeastern corner of the country by the Taliban and by Arab and Pakistani volunteers, including some forces loyal to Osama bin Laden.","12":"In its 1999 report on global terrorism, the State Department said that the group, led by Fazlur Rehman Khalil, had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who has been implicated in the bombing of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998. The group, which claims to have several thousand armed supporters in Pakistan, operated terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and suffered casualties during the 1998 missile strikes by the United States against Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Because of those casualties, Mr. Khalil warned that Harkat ul-Mujahedeen would take revenge against the United States, the State Department said.","120":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 29\u2014 Despite a trail of clues suggesting that the destroyer Cole was bombed by Islamic militants, possibly associated with Osama bin Laden, American investigators lack the concrete evidence to prove anything, administration and government officials say. Washington is wary of inflaming political turmoil in the Middle East by making unsubstantiated accusations, the officials say.","1200":"The tug of war between moderation and extremism is evident in the Petronas Towers themselves. Someone has scribbled 'long live Osama bin Laden' on the wall of the one of its gleaming elevators.","1201":"However, I would hate to place my trust in Osama bin Laden and his friends to bring peace and prosperity to the Persian Gulf based on what the Taliban have brought to Afghanistan. Just ask the Afghan women!","1202":"More broadly, American officials admit that they have poor intelligence about the makeup and operations of Afghanistan's drug trafficking organizations and know even less about how those groups might be linked to Osama bin Laden or other suspected terrorists.","1203":"Legal experts are beginning to ask fundamental questions: If Osama bin Laden and his supporters are caught, will they be tried? And if so, where and how? PAGE B5","1204":"A group of men, and one old woman who has come to beg, say they oppose terrorism, but in the next breath they say Osama bin Laden is, according to a translator, 'a Muslim, and O.K.'","1205":"From the eerily passionless voice of Osama bin Laden to the fevered chants on the streets of the Middle East and across the Islamic world, a litany of historical grievances against the West is being aired.","1207":"QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 21\u2014 Glossy posters of Osama bin Laden atop a white stallion or brandishing a Kalashnikov are selling as fast as they are printed in Quetta's chaotic bazaar. Osama T-shirts and chocolates wrapped in his bearded face are popular, too.","1208":"President Bush has said he is determined to carry on the search for Osama bin Laden and efforts to topple the Taliban leadership that shelters him even if takes a year or more. But the harsh Afghan winter will hamper American and British ground actions in Afghanistan.","1209":"A DIFFERENT VIEW -- The American campaign to capture or kill Osama bin Laden has elevated his stature among many Pakistanis, who now regard him as a hero. B5","1210":"What about a connection between Osama bin Laden and Iraq's Saddam Hussein? Because the Scowcroft set at the National Security Council is still in denial about its blunder a decade ago that permitted Saddam to stay in power, the C.I.A. professes to see no collaboration in Baghdad.","1212":"As many as 2,000 Arab and Pakistani volunteers, including followers of Osama bin Laden, along with perhaps 5,000 Taliban soldiers fill a maze of trenches, bunkers and minefields in the area, known as the Shamali Plain.","1213":"The diplomats said that one obvious target for the new bombing would be the Taliban's 55 Brigade, a unit of troops seconded to the Taliban forces from Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization.","1214":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 21\u2014 Since Sept. 11, President Bush has issued new orders to the C.I.A. spelling out a wider and more intense effort to eliminate Osama bin Laden as leader of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda, administration officials said today.","1215":"The next week, the country's attention turned to Osama bin Laden as the suspected terrorist behind the attacks, and the newsmagazines faced the question of how to depict him. The cover of U.S. News featured a photograph of Mr. bin Laden's face in a gun's cross hairs, and Newsweek altered Mr. bin Laden's photo to look like an infrared image.","1217":"In the next day's strip, Huey tried to convince the F.B.I., pointing out that in the administration of Ronald Reagan the C.I.A. trained Osama bin Laden and other Afghan rebels to fight the Soviet Union. The strip then suggests that the current Bush administration has also given financial support to the Taliban government.","1219":"I'm writing you both urgently because I fear your conflict is deteriorating so far and fast that it's going to undermine my ability to sustain the war against Osama bin Laden.","122":"[The investigation is focused on Osama bin Laden, but no evidence has yet been found directly linking him to the attack, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said in a speech at Ohio State University in Columbus, The Associated Press reported. 'We are looking very closely at Osama bin Laden to see whether or not he in fact or organizations he supports are in some way connected,' Mr. Cohen said.]","1220":"IN OUR MIDST -- In 1995, when American intelligence officials beganto pay attention to Osama bin Laden, one of his topcommanders slipped into the United States for a coast-to-coast fund-raising tour. B4","1221":"Uzbekistan has been a crucial United States ally both in the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan and in America's attempt to rid the world of biological weapons.","1222":"But that may not be enough to topple the Taliban, which has been a crucial target from the start because of its role in providing a sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network.","1223":"On Sunday, two American jets bombed nearby Taliban positions, dropping four to five bombs on Uzboshe and Qharip Qole, headquarters used by foreign soldiers including followers of Osama bin Laden, alliance officials said. American jets circled overhead five hours later but dropped no bombs, they added.","1224":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 22\u2014 Germany is trying to determine if followers of Osama bin Laden are still be operating within its borders and could strike again, the German interior minister said today.","1225":"For all the screening and the rush to secure more Cipro, the genesis of the bacteria remained a mystery, at least to the public. The government was still unable to say whether there was any connection to Osama bin Laden and his terror network. The lack of anything more tangible seemed to render the outbreak all the more fearsome -- a scourge that seemed to have no identifiable motive or source to combat.","1226":"I'm writing you both urgently because I fear your conflict is deteriorating so far and fast that it's going to undermine my ability to sustain the war against Osama bin Laden.","1227":"Although General Musharraf's military government has disavowed Harkat ul-Mujahedeen and closed its offices in Pakistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because of its longstanding links to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, Pakistan is wary of being seen to have supported a bombing attack on the group, not only because many of the casualties appeared to have been Pakistanis.","1228":"Federal prosecutors say members of Mr. Kaplan's group had contacts with Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, in 1996 and 1997, but that they have no evidence of more recent contact.","1229":"But interviews with Muslim worshipers, religious leaders and others here, make clear that he has failed to convince many British Muslims either that Osama bin Laden was behind the Sept. 11 attacks or that the war on the Taliban is justified.","123":"Working from that assumption, and from warnings of fresh attacks on American military targets that he issued less than three weeks before the bombing, the F.B.I. has focused its attention on the possibility that the bombing was inspired or planned by Osama bin Laden. The Saudi-born Mr. bin Laden, who lives in hiding in Afghanistan, is on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list, accused of directing the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998 that killed 224 people.","1230":"As he stepped out of a Pakistani-owned grocery on Fifth Avenue, three men approached him. 'One of them looked at me and said: 'You look like Osama bin Laden. Are you from Pakistan?' ' he recalled yesterday. 'I said, 'Originally, yes.' '","1231":"The tumult of Quetta is only a 15-minute ride away on the gaudy buses that ply the chaotic streets, but Marriabad is an oasis in a parched desert of angry protesters and Osama bin Laden posters. Here America is not the target of a tide of hatred, but the Oz of ambitions and dreams.","1232":"In his session with reporters, Mr. Bush said once again that he had suspicions that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network was to blame for the anthrax discovered in Florida, New York and Washington.","1233":"Today was the first time that an American official had joined with German authorities in identifying accomplices in the attacks, and it was the most definitive statement by either government that Hamburg served as a base for the terrorism plot. American and German officials agree that the attackers took their orders from the Al Qaeda terrorism network of Osama bin Laden.","1234":"American military advisers arrived in the southern Philippines to help train Philippine troops who are fighting Muslim militants. The rebels are holding at least 12 hostages, including two American missionaries. They are believed to have links with the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden.","1235":"HATE ATTACKS -- A freelance journalist born in Pakistan has been documenting recent accounts of bias against Arabs in America. Now he has found himself in the middle of his own story after being beaten and told he looked like Osama bin Laden. B10","1236":"Mr. Suweidi also said $15,000 was transferred to a man who allegedly helped manage the assets of Osama bin Laden on Sept. 9. The financial manager, Mustafa Ahmed al-Hisawi, received the payment and immediately left the Emirates for Pakistan, he said.","1237":"At a festive wedding I attended last Saturday it was obviously going to take more than Osama bin Laden to keep the Electric Sliders off the dance floor. Not while the fabulous Jimmy D was spinning the platters.","1238":"Not that American commanders or their closest allies, the British, ever thought that the war would be conducted without such mistakes or without peril to allied forces. Unavoidable risks come with the use of ground troops, who saw their first real action last Friday, a pinprick raid in and around Kandahar. That was well and good, said Britain's top military officer, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce. But to ferret out Osama bin Laden and destroy his terrorist network, the admiral said, it may be necessary to send ground forces into Afghanistan not for just a few hours but for days and even weeks at a time.","1239":"Such buck-passing won't work. With logic, followers of Osama bin Laden will say, 'By killing thousands of Americans, we got the U.S. to put pressure on Israel. In the same way, by panicking Americans with the threat of germ warfare, we will force the infidels to abandon their Jewish ally. And then . . .'","124":"One defendant accused in yesterday's incident, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, has been charged with participating in a worldwide terrorist conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom prosecutors suspect masterminded the 1998 attacks on the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people and injured thousands.","1240":"One suit based on the Sept. 11 attacks was filed this month by a New Jersey woman whose husband was killed in the World Trade Center. Filed in federal court in New York, it named as defendants Osama bin Laden, his network, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan and the ruling Taliban.","1241":"Americans might have been surprised at some statements made here. After all, these were the people Washington hopes to see supplanting the Taliban. At least three speakers said Osama bin Laden, accused by Washington in the Sept. 11 attacks, was a hero of the jihad and should remain Afghanistan's guest.","1243":"In the dark days after Taliban forces swept across northern Afghanistan in 1996, General Massoud decided that his salvation lay in smaller, better-trained and highly mobile infantry units. The general, who was attacked on Sept. 9 by two men thought to have ties to Osama bin Laden and who died several days later, dreamed of 20,000 well-equipped soldiers who could strike quickly and effectively in coordinated attacks.","1244":"No one, not even their relatives, should show terrorists sympathy, the prince said, adding: 'The body has diseases and some organ could be diseased. So the diseased organ must be removed.' Osama bin Laden was born a Saudi but the ruling family stripped him of his passport in 1994.","1245":"Federal authorities moved quickly to transfer four convicted followers of Osama bin Laden to a high-security prison in Pennsylvania after they were sentenced last week in the embassy bombings trial.","1246":"Of course, all this could change quickly. A major mistake in bombing, the loss of a large number of American ground troops, a failure to find Taliban leaders or Osama bin Laden could all turn public opinion.","1247":"Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the lead federal prosecutor in the recent embassy bombings trial in Manhattan, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate as the United States attorney in Chicago. A Harvard Law School graduate, Mr. Fitzgerald joined the United States attorney's office in Manhattan in 1988. He was co-chief of the terrorism unit and helped supervise that office's investigation of Osama bin Laden, who is now suspected of masterminding the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","1248":"So Ms. Khan's identity was in flux, even before the events of Sept. 11 transformed her from a citified, New Age Muslim who shopped at Ikea, skated in Central Park and made profitable use of her law degree as a project-finance associate at Chadbourne &amp; Park, to an angrily articulate advocate intent on disproving any link between Islam and the fugitive who dominates her nightmares, Osama bin Laden.","1249":"Mr. Ressam seems a much more revealing figure today. Just three months ago he testified in Federal District Court in Manhattan against another conspirator, telling of his own time in one of Osama bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. He was trained in the use of weapons and explosives bought from the Taliban, he said, and was taught to sabotage 'the infrastructure of a country' by attacking 'electric plants, gas plants, airports, railroads, large corporations and military installations.'","125":"Both men have been held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center while awaiting trial on charges that they participated in a worldwide terrorism conspiracy led by the wealthy Saudi financier, Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities suspect of masterminding the 1998 attacks on the United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The blasts killed more than 200 people and injured thousands.","1250":"Most recently, Ms. White's office prosecuted four followers of Osama bin Laden on charges that they conspired in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people.","1251":"LONDON, Oct. 24\u2014 With combat in Afghanistan moving from exclusive reliance on airstrikes to complex commando operations, Britain's top military officer said today that ground troops may have to operate in Afghanistan for weeks at a time if they are to ferret out Osama bin Laden and destroy his terrorist network.","1253":"In an indirect reference to Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorist network, the resolution said 'foreigners,' meaning the Arab militants who predominate in Al Qaeda, should no longer 'exploit the hospitality of Afghans and should leave the country.'","1255":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 25\u2014 The Saudi family of Osama bin Laden is severing its financial ties with the Carlyle Group, a private investment firm known for its connections to influential Washington political figures, executives who have been briefed on the decision said today.","1256":"Mr. Rumsfeld also changed his assessment of the likelihood that the United States would capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the head of the terrorist network Al Qaeda.","1257":"Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has worked for years on money-laundering legislation, said, 'Osama bin Laden has boasted that his modern, new recruits know the, in his words, cracks in Western financial systems like they know the lines in their own hands.'","1258":"THE TALIBAN'S ENDURANCE -- If that sounded less than reassuring, so did the war news. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told USA Today that he was not sure the United States would be able to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. As for Mr. bin Laden's Taliban protectors, their fighters were proving to be more determined than expected, American military commanders acknowledged.","1259":"It also threatens to undermine Israeli relations with Washington. The new eruption of violence in the Mideast is not helpful to America's effort to hold together a fragile coalition of nations in the battle against Osama bin Laden and international terrorism. Despite a personal plea from President Bush to withdraw Israeli troops, Mr. Sharon continues these military operations, the broadest in the West Bank in nearly a decade. That ill serves the long-term interests of both Israel and the United States.","126":"Sanctions were first imposed last year at the behest of the United States, which is demanding that Afghanistan turn over the fugitive Saudi financier Osama bin Laden, who is living there.","1260":"The Saudi ruling family would love to cooperate by handing over its police files on the 15 Saudis involved in the hijackings, but that would be a violation of its sovereignty, and, well, you know how much the Saudis respect sovereignty -- like when the Saudi Embassy in Washington rushed all of Osama bin Laden's relatives out of America after Sept. 11 on a private Saudi jet, before they could be properly questioned by the F.B.I.","1262":"A recent overhaul of banking rules has persuaded foreign governments to remove Panama from the list, in time to assure American officials that no accounts linked to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network have been found here. Officials continue to investigate several suspicious corporations, but have yet to find anything illegal.","1263":"Further Questions for Discussion:\u2013Do you think that publishers are \u201cusing\u201d the terrorist attacks and the related tragic events as a way to make more money, or that they are simply providing readers with books that interest them? \u2013What book topics do you think are always popular, and why? \u2013Do you think the quality of a book is related to how many copies it sells? Why or why not? \u2013Would you want to read a book about Osama bin Laden or the Taliban? Why or why not? \u2013It is often said that \u201cart mimics life.\u201d What do you think this means? Do you think this is true for books? Why or why not?","1264":"NO RESPONSE -- More than a week after submitting lists of questions to Osama bin Laden, neither CNN nor the Arabic-language news network Al Jazeera has received a response. B4","1265":"After three weeks of American bombing runs, the limits of air power are evident in Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden remains in hiding and the Taliban have not crumbled. In a costly mistake yesterday, a Red Cross warehouse was accidentally bombed again. Word also came that an important opposition leader whom Washington had looked to as a potential rallying point for dissident Pashtuns had been captured and executed by Taliban forces.","1266":"Britain's announcement means that the United States' closest ally is prepared to share the risks of ground operations to search for Osama bin Laden and Taliban leaders, a politically significant step as the Bush administration tries to maintain public support for the complex operation.","1267":"The coalition supporting the military campaign against Osama bin Laden is united to combat terrorism, but there is no such consensus on other issues. Championing the rights of Afghan women works well with a domestic audience, but Bush officials caution against raising it too loudly abroad.","1268":"He said the best chance America had of achieving its primary goal -- capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and uprooting his Qaeda terrorist network -- rested with Pakistani-backed efforts to create a successor government that would include 'moderate' elements of the Taliban.","1269":"But after weeks of speculation and conflicting reports about Iraqi contacts with a cell leader who plotted the attacks, today's confirmation raises fresh questions about whether Iraq's foreign intelligence arm in recent years established secret ties with Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization.","127":"Federal prosecutors, however, have taken a consistent stand that the defendants remain a threat. All were charged with participating in a worldwide terrorist conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, and some have been accused of playing direct roles in the attacks on embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","1270":"A front-page article on Oct. 11 about a discussion between the White House national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and executives of the five major television networks about the presentation of videotapes of Osama bin Laden mischaracterized an outcome of the talks. The executives agreed to consider editing such tapes to remove language that might incite violence against Americans, but not to do so automatically. They said they would determine what to exclude, not the government.","1271":"Their children do not march on university campuses shouting anti-American slogans or profess admiration for religious extremists like Osama bin Laden, who has divided the world into good Muslims and bad infidels. Their children are sent abroad to study, in the United States and Europe, and return to take their place among the country's elite.","1272":"All that remained was the signal from Osama bin Laden's operatives in Afghanistan to strike. The nod was to come from a Frenchman of Algerian origin who was on his way back from training in Afghanistan.","1274":"PATERSON\u2014 AN off-duty fireman wandered into the Paterson New Market Street Rod and Gun Club and requested four copies of Osama bin Laden.","1275":"Ms. Coyle notes that terrorists like Osama bin Laden had begun using capitalism's own tools to attack it. She mentions that he and his allies were believed to be using encrypted pornography sites at one point to exchange information in planning attacks. And in one chillingly prescient passage, she anticipates the skill of people like Mr. bin Laden in psychological warfare through the use of the Internet and modern media.","1276":"It is the vision that has helped shape the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1277":"Yet antiwar activists say that negotiations and diplomacy should never be ruled out the way President Bush has rebuffed offers by the Taliban to have Osama bin Laden tried outside the United States.","1278":"ISRAEL today is not the Israel of 1991. The intervening years have seen the rise of a great hope and its collapse, and Israelis perceive the past 14 months as a full-blown war with the Palestinians. Discussion in Israel these days is whether Yasir Arafat is more like Osama bin Laden or the Taliban -- whether he is a direct perpetrator of terror, or a facilitator. So many Israelis cannot understand why Washington continues trying to restart negotiations, or why it keeps honking 'not helpful' when Israel uses what few levers it has to put pressure on Mr. Arafat, whether assassinations, air strikes or incursions into Palestinian territory.","1279":"Then Sept. 11 struck and in a reversal of the familiar adage, all politics became global. Westchester residents suddenly wanted to know more about Osama bin Laden than about county tax cuts. The campaigns of both Mr. Spano, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Horowitz, the Republican, came to a halt.","128":"It was into this world, ancient and in essential ways unchanging, that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped two weeks ago. What drew them was not a way of life that has fascinated generations of Arabists, anthropologists and explorers. Rather, they were investigating the links between this fastness of low-lying mountains and Osama bin Laden, the self-proclaimed leader of an Islamic 'holy war' against the United States, who is considered a prime suspect in organizing or at least inspiring the bombing of the destroyer Cole on Oct. 12, which killed 17 American sailors.","1280":"Neither child voiced fear or seemed frightened. But my son bubbled with questions -- about flying, the attacks, 'that guy Omana.' He liked the sky marshal idea. ('A policeman? That's good,' he said.) My daughter asked if the National Guard looked like Buckingham Palace guards. We decided to fly. We left on Oct. 6, a day before the start of retaliatory American airstrikes against Afghanistan, and returned on Oct. 14, the day a Kuwaiti spokesman for Osama bin Laden threatened to kill more Westerners. Our flights and our kids were fine.","1281":"Nonetheless, the first reality of this odd moment is that all three are more threatened by instability than they are by each other. There is the new threat of terrorists like Osama bin Laden who act outside the structure of any state, the old threat of regional chaos in Afghanistan, and concern about the potential for radical Islamic uprisings in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia.","1282":"According to the Pentagon, the Taliban's air force is no more. Taliban command centers have been pulverized. Barracks and ammunition dumps have been blasted and many channels of communication sundered. Major terrorist traning camps linked to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, which were abandoned at the start of the military campaign, have been leveled.","1283":"It was little more than a week ago that the Pentagon proclaimed that Taliban forces in Afghanistan had been 'eviscerated' by American airstrikes. The United States owned the Afghan skies, it was said. The Taliban air force was no more. Command centers were turned to dust. Abandoned training camps once run by Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, had been leveled.","1284":"CAMDEN\u2014 IF Osama bin Laden were captured tomorrow and brought to America for trial, Eddie Jacobs Jr. would be glad to defend him.","1285":"Pace Law School, which opened in 1975, has a history of being a liberal, progressive institution. One of its graduates, Stanley L. Cohen, a Port Chester native who works in Manhattan, is a radical lawyer who has defended terrorism suspects and has said he would consider representing Osama bin Laden. In the mid-1990's, Mr. Cohen defended Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, leader of the political wing of the militant Palestinian group Hamas. He recently defended Moataz Al-Hallak, who was questioned by law enforcement officials last month in connection with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and then released.","1286":"Agents made the requests for the intercepts barely minutes after the planes crashed into the World Trade Center, knowing from past terrorist acts that Osama bin Laden's followers often phoned to congratulate one another after successful operations.","1287":"And yet what is true here is true, in varying degrees, throughout the country: there is much I don't know about Osama bin Laden, but there is something he doesn't know about me, and you, and the rest of us. He doesn't know what a disparate culture we live in, how constantly at odds with itself it is. One paradox of our country is that the society that looks like such a monolith from without, looks, from within, so fragmented.","1288":"POLICE WORK -- Law enforcement officials across Europe said a plot to bomb the American embassy in Paris that was foiled late last month gave them a glimpse of how Osama bin Laden has operated in their midst and offered clues about how future plots might unfold. B1","1289":"Among them are the so-called Arab brigades, the military nexus between the Taliban government and Al Qaeda, a foreign legion assembled by Osama bin Laden, himself a Saudi who fought with the mujahedeen. 'Very ideologically motivated,' as the intelligence officer described these forces, they 'bring a different kind of fighting to the front than is experienced in a very long time. They give no quarter. They expect no quarter. They defend areas where traditional Taliban troops would, you know, pull back and hope for another day.'","1290":"Necrophiliac fervor at first seemed confined to Shiites (not just Iranians but the Lebanese factions that drove vehicles laden with explosives into the American Embassy and marine headquarters in Beirut in 1983). How suicide bombing then got adopted as a weapon by the Sunni Muslims of Palestine and the Arabian Peninsula -- and then by a multinational consortium drawing in Egyptians, Algerians, Moroccans and Kenyans that found its prime targets on American soil -- is a tangled question for scholars. All that happened when we were looking the other way. We ticked off the bombings but didn't pay close attention when, three years ago, Osama bin Laden declared 'war' on the United States. Other things -- like a White House sex scandal and the Nasdaq -- preoccupied us when he called us 'the most filthy sort of human beings' and a 'lowly people.' It didn't register when he said it was a sacred duty for Muslims to kill American civilians or praised young bombers for giving their lives to this 'killing and neck smiting.' And beyond the caves of Afghanistan, few seemed to be listening anyhow -- as far as we knew or cared.","1292":"9 11 2 THE NEW JACKALS, by Simon Reeve. (Northeastern University, $26.95.) Tracking the career of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and his links to Osama bin Laden.","1293":"The ongoing civil war and changes in political structure sometimes made the work difficult and staff security has been a concern since the group first began operating in the region, said Gary Shaye, the organization's vice president for international programs. But the situation became more complicated after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Almost immediately, the United States began eyeing Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden.","1294":"At any other time, I might have read and then dismissed the efforts of the Bush administration to hone a perfect speech as just another example of manipulative president-packaging (D.T. Max, Oct. 7). However, given its juxtaposition to the image of Osama bin Laden, microphone in hand, delivering exaltations and threats as adroitly as a seasoned field correspondent filing an exclusive battlefield report, I am now a shameless booster of the administration's efforts. I have an uneasy feeling that bin Laden is the best-packaged man on the planet.","1295":"This time, it seemed, his half brother Osama bin Laden might have finally shattered the family's reputation, especially for those members who lived in the United States.","1296":"Because the Internet enables the immediate, worldwide distribution of digitized content, it has become a locus for Sept. 11-related material. To date the creative endeavors seen online have mostly been photographic or video documentaries or savage animations targeted at Osama bin Laden that might be thought of as high-tech folk art. Eventually, more digital artists are expected to weigh in with their visual interpretations of current events, as they have in the past.","1297":"The couples traded stories, like the one about two Americans whose car broke down on a stretch of desert highway. They were immediately wary of two Saudi men who stopped to offer help. Sensing their unease, one Saudi turned to the Americans and said, 'By the way, we hate Osama bin Laden.'","1298":"Among them are the West's insistence on branding Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network as Muslim fanatics, rather than simply as terrorists, and the willingness of the United States to bomb Afghanistan before producing conclusive proof of Mr. bin Laden's guilt. There is also a lingering distrust of Western powers, whose intervention, many readers think, may provide a temporary solution but lays the groundwork for fresh political squabbles.","13":"American investigators have uncovered what they believe are links between Algerians who have been charged with plotting a terrorist attack in the United States and Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of bombing two American Embassies in East Africa, law enforcement officials said yesterday.","130":"On Oct. 20, the Federal District Court in Manhattan accepted a guilty plea from Ali A. Mohamed, a former Green Beret sergeant and one of six men indicted for the bombings of American embassies in Africa in 1998. Mr. Mohamed not only confessed that he had taken part in a conspiracy to murder American citizens in Saudi Arabia and East Africa, but tied the assaults directly to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Significantly, his confession also linked Mr. bin Laden with another terrorist at large -- the mysterious Hezbollah security chief, Imad Mughniyah.","1300":"For all their talk of terror and tactics, though, the men on the tapes were neither associates of Osama bin Laden nor members of his Al Qaeda terror network. Investigators say they have no evidence that these men were involved with the Sept. 11 hijackers or were part of recently disclosed plots to attack American Embassies in Paris and Rome.","1301":"Away from the job there have also been unexpected reminders of anti-American animosity, he said. The soccer team at the school that Mr. Shirts's 16-year-old son attends wanted to change its name to Osama bin Laden, but was overruled by the school's administration.","1302":"For Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the issue is particularly delicate. A general who seized power, he reversed policies to back the American campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government sheltering him, and is now under tremendous pressure from Islamic militants.","1303":"Find out if Osama bin Laden watches 'Friends.' If he does, offer him a guest role in a November sweeps episode, including several spicy scenes with Courteney Cox Arquette. During rehearsal week, gradually replace the entire cast with look-alikes from the C.I.A. On the night of the taping, they pounce.","1304":"BEHIND THE SCENES -- The intelligence service of Pakistan, a crucial American ally in the war on terrorism, has had an indirect but longstanding relationship with Al Qaeda, turning a blind eye for years to the growing ties between Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, according to American officials. A1","1305":"Now the enemy is Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network. Gen. Peter Pace of the Marines, the vice chairman of the joint chiefs, observed yesterday's coin toss at midfield, but most government leaders were much too busy to stop by the box of the current owner, Daniel Snyder.","1306":"Those who blamed Islamic militants said it was not just the beards of the attackers, at least one of them said to have been long and straggly, just like Osama bin Laden's, just like those worn as a kind of banner of defiance by Islamic extremists who have branded their hatred for all things they associate with the Western world, especially America, and especially Christians and Jews, into the life of Pakistan.","1307":"Ms. Clement says the morbid humor here has kept her and her two children upbeat in the wake of the tragedy of Sept. 11. She finds it empowering to chuckle at Halloween masks of Osama bin Laden being sold on busy street corners, or to howl out loud at the jokes sent to her by e-mail. She is proud of her 10-year-old daughter's choice of anthrax as a topic for a paper. And she raved about her son's classmate who showed up at a Halloween party disguised as one of the Twin Towers.","1308":"Somebody put up a poster in Christopher Purdy's office in Jakarta showing Osama bin Laden with features of the comic character Mr. Bean. The caption read, 'Osama Bean Laden.'","1309":"American officials have said that its members have trained in Afghan camps, some controlled by Osama bin Laden, accused of organizing the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and that the group is based in northern Afghanistan. For its part, the American government has added the group to its list of terrorist organizations.","131":"American officials have said that those plots were coordinated by militants linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of bombing the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. If the suspect's account is confirmed, it would provide investigators with more evidence that the attack on the Cole is linked to Mr. bin Laden.","1310":"It is becoming increasingly clear that the loose coalition of northern minority groups fighting the Taliban has its own problems, as it appears increasingly to be a largely ineffective political and military force. It is clearly reeling from the assassination last month of the charismatic military leader Ahmed Shah Massoud. The assassination, carried out by two men said to have ties to Osama bin Laden, appears to have nearly paralyzed the alliance.","1311":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28\u2014 The intelligence service of Pakistan, a crucial American ally in the war on terrorism, has had an indirect but longstanding relationship with Al Qaeda, turning a blind eye for years to the growing ties between Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, according to American officials.","1312":"'As a hiker, I know that if people are willing to be completely rural, to live under trees and hide in caves, they are impervious to the kind of wars we fight,' he said. 'I think the war against Osama bin Laden is hopeless, but I also think we have no choice but to fight it.'","1313":"With the terror crisis now seven weeks old, though, there were signs that the nation, even if wiser, was not prepared to be patient forever. A New York Times/CBS News poll, taken before the latest warning, showed that the public still overwhelmingly supported President Bush, giving him an 87 percent job approval rating. But more than half said federal and local governments had not done enough to prepare for a biological attack, and nearly half of the respondents said the government was withholding information about the anthrax cases. Only 28 percent said they were 'very confident' that Osama bin Laden would be captured or killed.","1314":"STRANGE BEDFELLOWS -- A top C.I.A. official secretly traveled to Damascus this month to talk to Syrian intelligence officials about helping the United States investigate Osama bin Laden's terror network, American officials said.

Rumsfeld said today.","1317":"Well, on Sept. 11 we learned just how wrong that view was. What we didn't know hurt us very badly. On Sept. 11 we learned all the things about Saudi Arabia that we didn't know: that Saudi Arabia was the primary funder of the Taliban, that 15 of the hijackers were disgruntled young Saudis and that Saudi Arabia was allowing fund-raising for Osama bin Laden -- as long as he didn't use the money to attack the Saudi regime.","1318":"The leader of that terrorist plot, Jamal Beghal, told French intelligence officals that he trained in Afganistan and that before leaving that country for France, he met with an associate of Osama bin Laden. The plan was for a suicide bomber to drive a minivan full of explosives through the embassy gates.","1319":"Americans for the first time are raising doubts about whether the nation can accomplish its objectives in fighting terrorism at home and abroad, including capturing or killing Osama bin Laden, saving the international alliance from unraveling and protecting people from future attacks, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows.","132":"Islamic militants who bombed the destroyer Cole on Oct. 12 apparently tried to strike another American warship 10 months earlier. A suspect in the Cole attack told Yemeni agents that a January attack failed when an explosives-packed skiff foundered. The Yemenis have not let Americans question suspects but are sharing information that suggests those involved in the Cole attack are linked to Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi militant. Steven Lee Myers","1320":"Your Oct. 27 editorial headline was right: the war has just begun. We have to be in this effort for the long haul. There should be no quarter given to Osama bin Laden and his network of supporters, even to make a gesture to Muslims worldwide. If we succumb to pressure to have a pause for Ramadan, it will be doubly hard to restart the air campaign.","1321":"All sorts of unknowns loom that could thwart OPEC's plans. Oil demand has fallen substantially as the global economy has slumped. But some analysts said the group risks cutting too deeply just as heating oil demand picks up. The course of the American retaliation against Osama bin Laden could also jar the world economy again, and if it expands to include Iraq, oil production in the Persian Gulf could be thrown into disarray.","1322":"The novelist Dacia Maraini wrote that 'if you turn this into the first move of a holy war, you are helping him,' meaning Osama bin Laden, adding, 'It is a trap, Oriana, in which you seem to have fallen, spurred on by the impetuousness and the courage -- a little quixotic in this case -- that characterize you.'","1323":"Since the crisis began, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who recently voiced doubts that the United States would be able to kill or capture Osama bin Laden and later had to explain himself, has made more gaffes. But because of his rank and his rumpled, straightforward manner, he gets better performance reviews from reporters than Mr. Fleischer, whose smooth, studied replies can come off as unctuous. Perhaps to telegraph calm or good humor, Mr. Fleischer smiles regularly, but especially these days, his smile flashes, somewhat disconcertingly, even during sober pronouncements about spores, mail slitters and Cipro.","1324":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 29\u2014 A top C.I.A. official secretly traveled to Damascus this month to talk to Syrian intelligence officials about helping the United States investigate and defeat Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, according to American officials.","1325":"ECONOMIC VALUE Jordan's career value to the economy was pegged at $10 billion by Fortune magazine several years ago, and now that he is back, he is expected to pull the economy out of the recession, find Osama bin Laden and make purple popular for reasons that exclude dinosaurs named Barney. The Yankees' new YES network is valued at nearly $900 million. Advantage: Jordan.","1326":"I am astonished that while American special forces are hunting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and Congressional and Postal Service employees line up to be tested for anthrax, you continue to obsess about 'campaign donors' (editorial, Oct. 25). It has become difficult to take seriously an editorial page that argues that in the wake of the attacks on our country, missile defense is less relevant while simultaneously arguing that campaign finance reform is 'more important than ever' (editorial, Oct. 16).","1327":"Analysts in the region continue to review the material taken from a compound on the outskirts of Kandahar and belonging to the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. But an early assessment has disappointed senior military commanders who believed that the cache might have clues to the whereabouts and operations of senior Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","1328":"There is a simple and effective way to conserve: begin immediately to tax gasoline at rates comparable to the high rates levied by European governments. This will undoubtedly cause much initial economic pain, but that pain will be nothing like what we will endure if we continue to ignore the role Saudi Arabia has played in fostering the growth of Osama bin Laden and his movement, Al Qaeda.","1329":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 30\u2014 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is planning to leave this week for Russia and nations near Afghanistan as the Bush administration strives to hold together its coalition for the military campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government that protects him.","133":"The two defendants accused in the stabbing were among five men facing charges that they participated in a global terrorist conspiracy that the prosecution says was led by Osama bin Laden and included the bombings of two United States embassies in East Africa in 1998. The bombings killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands.","1330":"Air power alone, Senator McCain and some colleagues in both parties argue, will never force Osama bin Laden into the open. They believe that only ground troops, operating from a secure base within Afghanistan, will do the trick. That might well involve tens of thousands of troops, hundreds of casualties and many months of effort, they concede, but they see no viable option.","1331":"TERRORISM WARNING -- The government said its latest warning of possible terrorist attacks stemmed from credible intelligence sources, including an electronic interception of a coded message from an associate of Osama bin Laden. A1","1332":"Mr. Siri ran an organization he set up in London in 1995 called the Islamic Observation Center, which describes itself as 'concerned with human rights issues for Muslims all over the world.' British officials have accused it of issuing a statement in behalf of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","1333":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 30\u2014 The Bush administration said today that its latest nationwide warning of possible terrorist attacks resulted from credible intelligence sources, some of them connected to Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda.","1334":"There is a simple and effective way to conserve: begin immediately to tax gasoline at rates comparable to the high rates levied by European governments.

Will that diminish or increase terrorism in the world?","1336":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 31\u2014 Pakistan has arrested three of the country's leading nuclear scientists and held them for questioning for most of the last week in connection with American concerns that nuclear weapons technology could have found its way into the hands of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, officials in Pakistan said today.","1337":"Within hours, residents recalled, youths trooped out of poor Muslim neighborhoods, where posters of Osama bin Laden have become hugely popular. They invaded the Christian quarter, whose residents fought back with arms, waving T-shirts emblazoned with American flags and shouting pro-American slogans.","1338":"Among those added to the watch list were several Middle Eastern charitable organizations and food companies that are accused of funneling money to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization.","1339":"PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR SECRETS -- Pakistan arrested three of its leading nuclear scientists in connection with concerns that nuclear weapons technology could have found its way into the hands of the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden.

The authorities say the conspiracy included the bombings of two United States embassies in East Africa in 1998. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.","1340":"Diplomats speculate that Somalia's lawlessness makes it a potential hide-out for Osama bin Laden, the top suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks against the United States, should American bombing raids make it impossible for him and his backers to stay in Afghanistan.","1341":"President Bush has been saying for weeks that Saudi officials were cooperating in the fight against terrorism, and his aides have often repeated a statement that Saudi Arabia has 'done everything we've asked them to do' to help combat Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","1342":"As the military campaign enters its fourth week, the Pentagon is using several means to try to topple the Taliban, destroy Al Qaeda and hunt down its leader, Osama bin Laden. They include a classic air campaign of around-the-clock bombing and at least one raid by Special Forces. But a new element is more active support for the Northern Alliance.","1343":"The United States shifted gears in its military campaign against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban protectors. Officials said that more teams of American advisers will be slipped into Afghanistan to work with rebel militias like the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.","1344":"He spoke after Pakistan said it had detained three of the country's leading nuclear scientists for questioning in connection with concerns in the United States that nuclear weapons technology could have found its way into the hands of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.","1346":"As the airstrikes in Afghanistan near the end of their fourth week, American military planners need to step up preparations for what is almost sure to be the next phase of the conflict, an intensified ground campaign against the Taliban's main urban strongholds and the hillside hideouts of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","1347":"A SIGNED LETTER -- Western and Arab news organizations received copies of a handwritten letter in Arabic, carrying Osama bin Laden's signature, that calls on Pakistan's Muslims to defend Islam against what it called a Christian crusade. B2","1349":"ANKARA, Turkey, Nov. 1\u2014 Turkey said today that it would send 90 Special Forces troops to Afghanistan, making it the first Muslim nation to join the American-led attacks on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","135":"Mr. El-Hage and three co-defendants are awaiting trial in January on charges of participating in a global terrorist conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, which the authorities say included the 1998 bombings of two United States Embassies in East Africa.

But his remarks reflected a prominent feeling in the Muslim and Arab worlds that the perpetrators could not be inspired by Islam, regardless of what the United States says is strong evidence pointing to Osama bin Laden, who has called for Muslims to wage war on America.","1353":"When the president or his spokesmen are asked about civilian casualties from our bombing in Afghanistan, they should answer: 'Yes, for the 30th straight day Osama bin Laden, a mass murderer, has cloaked himself in a human blanket of Afghan civilians. Unfortunately, this has led to some civilian deaths.' Or 'Yes, for the fourth straight week Osama bin Laden, the man who sends other Muslims to their death but never risks his own life, is now sending Afghans to die for him.'","1354":"Other experts stressed, however, that Mr. Bashiruddin Mahmood, an outspoken admirer of the Taliban, could not by himself help either the Taliban or Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorists build an actual nuclear weapon.","1355":"In Gaza, Mr. Arafat again put distance between himself and Osama bin Laden, rejecting as 'very dangerous talk' Mr. bin Laden's call for Muslims to rise up against Pakistan because of its collaboration in the American-led war on Afghanistan.","1356":"The indictment also says that a search of Mr. Awadallah's apartment turned up computer-generated photographs of Osama bin Laden.","1357":"A veteran prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has been appointed co-chief of the office's unit specializing in terrorism cases. The prosecutor, Kenneth M. Karas, replaces Patrick J. Fitzgerald, who was confirmed last week as United States attorney in Chicago. David N. Kelley continues as the other co-chief of the unit. Mr. Karas, 37, joined the prosecutor's office in 1992 and has been assisting in the investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Earlier this year, he helped try four men charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies.

The list included nuclear plants, refineries, chemical plants and airports.","1359":"The delays have complicated a campaign to oust the Taliban and capture or kill the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden. More than three weeks into the bombing, the Northern Alliance shows little sign of being ready to advance. At the same time, the bombardment has complicated efforts to form a 'Southern Alliance' among the Pashtuns dominant the south of Afghanistan. Angered by the attacks, some Pashtuns seem to have rallied to the Taliban.","136":"Yemen's prime minister said that investigators of the bombing of the United States destroyer Cole have identified the bombers as two Saudi Arabian citizens with Yemeni family roots who fought Soviet forces in Afghanistan. The two men have personal profiles that run closely parallel with that of Osama bin Laden, wanted by the F.B.I. on terrorism charges.

But they agreed that improved safeguards of fissionable material and nuclear power stations were urgently needed.","1362":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 2\u2014 The Bush administration imposed stringent financial sanctions today on the anti-Israeli organizations Hamas, Hezbollah and 20 other suspected terrorist groups, significantly broadening the campaign to seize terrorist assets beyond groups with links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.","1364":"Washington holds Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.","1365":"The position that Ms. Nasser sets forth denouncing terrorism except when there is a political justification, like fighting a country that is viewed as an 'occupying power' is one that Osama bin Laden, Puerto Rican nationalists, the Irish Republican Army, the Tamil Tigers and other terrorist groups would be happy to support.","1366":"The Bush administration gave the Treasury Department authority to seize assets of 22 suspected terrorist groups, including two Muslim organizations, Hamas and Hezbollah. The move broadened the antiterror campaign beyond Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and signaled the administration's growing confidence in the stability of the antiterror coalition.","1367":"'Osama bin Laden launched that attack from Afghanistan, a place where you have been helping people for years,' he said.

The aide, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, identified the two scientists as Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood and Chaudry Abdul Masheed. General Qureshi said nothing more about the third scientist, Mirza Yusuf Baig.","1372":"T-shirts lionizing Osama bin Laden are hits with those who feel themselves the world's dispossessed and see the terrorists striking a blow against an overweening superpower: in Algerian-populated suburbs of Paris and the Cape Flats of South Africa, in the streets of Cairo and Jakarta.","1373":"CAIRO, Nov. 3\u2014 In an attempt to play to Arab and Muslim popular opinion, Osama bin Laden portrayed the American military campaign in Afghanistan as a war against Islam, saying in a videotaped speech broadcast today that the Afghan people had done nothing to deserve such an onslaught.","1374":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 3\u2014 Four weeks after the United States began its military campaign to unseat the Taliban in Afghanistan and to destroy Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, there is an increasingly vigorous debate about whether substantial numbers of American combat troops will be needed to seal the victory in Afghanistan.","1375":"Much is expected of the Central Intelligence Agency these days, probably too much. As a pivotal front-line organization in the war against terrorism, the agency is supposed to detect and prevent new terror attacks, help locate and perhaps even kill Osama bin Laden and let President Bush know if the anthrax in the mail comes from Iraq -- to mention only a few of Washington's expectations. These are lofty demands to make of an institution that before Sept. 11 was still struggling to reinvent itself a decade after the end of the cold war. As much as the nation may yearn for a crack intelligence service that can save the day, there is no such outfit in Washington at present.","1376":"The Saudis are struggling with how far to go in acknowledging the presence of enemies in their midst.

Removing the Taliban from power, and discouraging states like Somalia and Sudan from taking in Osama bin Laden and his fellow terrorists, are major steps in that direction. But probably the most important ingredient in the war against Al Qaeda is good intelligence, which will allow the United States to locate the terrorists and strike at them with deadly force when the time is right -- and to locate, protect and reward those who come to the American side. The Bush administration should devote abundant resources to improving America's intelligence capabilities and to buying information on the terrorists from other governments.","138":"F.B.I. officials investigating the bombing of the destroyer Cole have kept open the possibility that the attack may have involved powerful figures in Yemen who have close ties to Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist. 6","1380":"The Taliban leader in Afghanistan, Mullah Mohammed Omar, as well as Osama bin Laden, have said that the conflict in Afghanistan is a 'holy war' pitting Muslims against Christians and Jews.","1381":"But the leader, Abdiqassim Salad Hassan, who is here for talks organized by the Kenyan government that aim to restore peace and unify his fractured country, is eager for America to return to Mogadishu. He hopes that the Sept. 11 attacks will serve to unite Somalia and the United States and not attract American bombs aimed at rooting out suspected links between his country and Osama bin Laden.","1382":"ANOTHER FRONT -- Twenty-three American military advisers visited the Philippines last week on a simple mission: hunt down an elusive band of guerrillas known as Abu Sayyaf, which American officials say has ties to Osama bin Laden. B4","1383":"The crawls on the bottom of the screen on cable news channels -- one more symptom of the overload -- often use misleading shorthand. Almost uniformly they said 'White House fears Osama bin Laden is sending coded messages' in his videos, which was not quite accurate. If you listened carefully to the televised news conference by Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, it was clear that what he said amounted to maybe, possibly, we don't really have any reason to think he is doing that. Yet the news crawls submissively adopted the stark, alarmist spin his tone suggested.","1384":"The government has been swift to capitalize on the new climate of fear, drawing parallels between the Basque group and Osama bin Laden's organization and pushing the European Union to streamline extradition measures that would leave E.T.A. members without safe havens in France and beyond.","1385":"Most of the 19 hijackers, perhaps all of them, spent time in Osama bin Laden's Afghan training camps, investigators now say. Some of the Sept. 11 soldiers appear to have met there. And like Mr. Atta and the other pilots, the muscle did not seem to fit the profile of suicide bombers as desperate and impoverished young men. With the exception of one, they were all Saudis, relatively well off and well educated. While the leaders seemed to be Islamic zealots, the muscle did not, indulging often in pornography and liquor.","1386":"Senior leaders of the Northern Alliance still claim that they are preparing to attack and help the American government topple the Taliban and capture Osama bin Laden. 'We are ready to attack,' Atiqullah Baryalai, the alliance's deputy defense minister, said earlier this week. 'Every day, we are getting stronger.'","1388":"Pakistan, to take the most obvious case, provides not only access to Afghanistan but also theological and ideological cover for Western nations fighting Muslims; as long as they stay with the alliance, it is hard for the Taliban government and the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, whom it shields, to argue that this is a war between civilizations or religions.","1389":"American officials say Abu Sayyaf has links to Osama bin Laden, which makes this an obvious place to expand the campaign against Al Qaeda. Interviews with local government officials, Muslim leaders, scholars and aid workers suggest those links, while plausible, are tenuous.","139":"But from the beginning, F.B.I. agents have kept open an alternate possibility -- that the attack may have involved powerful figures inside Yemen with close ties to Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I's most-wanted terrorist. Despite vigorous Yemeni denials, the F.B.I. has wanted to know whether any part of the Cole bombing was supported from within the government, or by powerful men with Islamic-militant credentials who live under official protection.","1390":"The United States has accused Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network of conducting both of those attacks.","1391":"Mr. Bush has been relentlessly upbeat, repeating almost daily, as he did again on Friday, that 'we're making very good progress' on both fronts, at home and abroad. He has left to others the more complicated messages -- that the Taliban show no sign of cracking, that no one knows how a Bronx woman who died this week contracted anthrax, that investigators are no closer to solving the mystery of whether the deadly powder is being sent by Osama bin Laden's followers, Iraq or domestic terrorists with a flair for biochemistry.","1393":"DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 4\u2014 Osama bin Laden is waging a war against the world and does not represent Arabs and Muslims, senior Arab officials said today at a gathering of foreign ministers here in the Syrian capital.","1394":"The 58-year-old general will leave behind a country where Friday Prayers have become a prelude to protests by thousands of Islamic militants who march from the mosques to burn effigies of President Musharraf beside those of President Bush, while photographs of Osama bin Laden are hoisted high.","1395":"A series of proposals to publish the words and ideas of Osama bin Laden are testing the willingness of book publishers to handle indisputably important but highly objectionable material, reviving a debate that has simmered since Houghton Mifflin published an English-language edition of 'Mein Kampf' in 1933.","1396":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4\u2014 For years American officials have suspected that Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network were taking advantage of the free-wheeling financial system of the United Arab Emirates, a tiny Persian Gulf nation that boasts of 47 banks and 105 money changers for its three million people.","1397":"The fierce, many-faceted threats of recent weeks have touched off a variety of cravings and urges, like a craving for information, understanding and certainty. The urge to help, to commemorate, to mourn or to warn. And, less intuitively, the urge to put up Web sites that link to topics like Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, bioterrorism, Islam, Osama bin Laden, the Pentagon or the World Trade Center.","1398":"'But the reality is that the threat of additional terrorist attacks are there,' he said, so long as the Taliban shelters Osama bin Laden and the leaders of his Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan.","1399":"THE ARAB LEAGUE -- Senior Arab officials meeting in Syria said Osama bin Laden was waging a war against the world and does not represent Arabs and Muslims.

While the latter two tried to excuse Osama bin Laden, Mr. Ghabra hammered back: 'The Lebanese civil war was not an American creation; neither was the Iran-Iraq war; neither was bin Laden. These are our creations. We need to look inside. We cannot be in this blame-others mode forever.'","1406":"It was only after Mr. Ressam's conviction that he decided to cooperate with prosecutors, who have since said he provided a wealth of information about terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, run by Osama bin Laden, as well as the operations and methods of the terrorists, their trainers and names of terrorist cell members.","1407":"At the same time, pressed by Washington not to get in the way of the war against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, Mr. Sharon clearly supports Mr. Peres's efforts to restore some semblance of comity with Mr. Arafat.","1408":"Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden","1409":"The administration has responded with intensified efforts to get its word out. When officials learned that Osama bin Laden had made another videotape available to Al Jezeera, the international Arab-language television station, for example, they quickly arranged for Christopher W. S. Ross, a fluent Arab speaker and former ambassador to Syria, to appear on the program.","141":"More than 200 people were killed and thousands of others were injured in the two embassy blasts, which prosecutors say were organized by Osama bin Laden, who has been indicted in the case but remains a fugitive and is believed to be living in Afghanistan. The bombing suspects are being tried in New York because federal prosecutors in Manhattan were actively investigating Mr. bin Laden for other terrorism acts predating the embassy explosions.","1410":"Those groups join the list that already includes groups under the control of or with ties to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of being behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","1411":"'Osama bin Laden says that all good Muslims should kill Americans,' declared Mr. Esmer, a 22-year-old Canadian comedian who was born in Turkey and raised by secular Muslim parents. 'I feel guilty telling the guy behind me in the movie theater to stop talking. Where does Osama think I would find the confidence to kill someone? I try to be a good Muslim, but it's tough just not eating pork. I mean, the McRib is so ---- oh well, at least I have my wives.'","1412":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 30\u2014 Prince Mamdouh bin Abdel Aziz is holding court in a glass tent with wall-to-wall beige carpeting erected in the garden behind his low-slung mansion, recalling the night a decade ago when Osama bin Laden attended an evening salon to describe his exploits fighting in Afghanistan.","1413":"Our first goal in the war was to capture Osama bin Laden, which we have not succeeded in doing. Our second goal was to force the Taliban government to turn Osama bin Laden over to us, which we have not succeeded in doing.","1414":"Most surprising was the change in attitude towards the United Nations. Since the Taliban took power in Kabul in 1996, they have been denied Afghanistan's United Nations seat because of their human rights abuses, and have defied a succession of Security Council resolutions demanding that the Taliban stop harboring Osama bin Laden.","1415":"Because of an editing error, a chart yesterday with an article about Osama bin Laden's challenge to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia misstated the name and title of the leader who serves below the ailing King Fahd. The official is Crown Prince Abdullah Abdel Aziz al-Saud (not simply Abdel Aziz); he is the first deputy prime minister; the title of prime minister, though rarely used, belongs to the king.","1416":"Mr. Karzai is regarded warmly in Washington, in part because he has long seen Osama bin Laden as a serious threat. After the battle last Thursday, Mr. Karzai told Ahmed by satellite telephone that most at tackers were Arabs and Pakistanis.","1417":"PRESIDENT BUSH, on Osama bin Laden. [B4]","1418":"BERLIN, Nov. 6\u2014 Despite nervousness among Europeans about the length and tactics of the American-led war against Afghanistan, European governments have not wavered in their support for Washington. The Europeans have had their own experience with terrorists, regard themselves as vulnerable to terrorist attacks, and understand that to oppose Washington now would put them on the side of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","1419":"The war against terrorism will be won only when we combine our strengths. We have a vast coalition that is uniting the world and increasingly isolating the terrorists, a coalition that includes many Arab and Muslim countries. I'm encouraged by what their leaders are saying. The head of the 22-nation Arab League rejected the claims of the terrorist leader and said he, Osama bin Laden, doesn't speak in the names of Arabs and Muslims.","142":"He was among 28 defendants who were tried in Amman this year on charges of links to the suspected master of terror Osama bin Laden and of plotting to attack American and Israeli targets in Jordan during millennium celebrations last December. Twelve of them, including Mr. Hijazi, were tried in absentia.","1420":"For the first time, the president himself accused Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, of seeking to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But other officials said there was no new evidence that Mr. bin Laden had in fact gotten his hands on weapons of mass destruction.","1421":"In a speech today to Central and Eastern European leaders and at an appearance in the Rose Garden with President Jacques Chirac of France, President Bush also sought to bolster support overseas by drawing a still darker picture of Osama bin Laden.","1422":"It's been known for years that Osama bin Laden wanted to go nuclear. So why would the president gild the plutonium lily by invoking a nuclear threat now, when Americans are already wincing and flinching their way through life? Why put fangs on a vampire?","1423":"He referred to four man-made caves on the military depot he runs here and to dozens of others that line the valley, the mountain stronghold of the anti-Taliban forces. Built to store ammunition, the caves here are similar to those in southern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leadership are believed to be hiding.","1424":"The Pentagon's hope was that the bombing attacks would force Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders to leave their sanctuaries, exposing them to attack. The image the Pentagon conjured up was of helicopter gunships packed with commandos in 'hot pursuit' of Osama bin Laden and his key lieutenants, to use President Bush's description.","1425":"The defectors, one of whom was a lieutenant general and once one of the most senior officers in the Iraqi intelligence service, the Mukhabarat, said they did not know if the Islamic militants being trained at the camp, known as Salman Pak, were linked to Osama bin Laden.","1426":"'Follow the money' is a tried and true maxim for investigators, and it works for President Bush, too. Repeatedly, he has made clear that one way to strike at Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, is to cut off its cash flow. Now that effort has taken a new course.","1427":"Rising unemployment in Pakistan could pose political problems for the United States since the nation is a key ally in the effort to rid Afghanistan of Osama bin Laden and his allies.","1428":"Al Taqwa is an association of offshore banks and financial management firms that have helped Al Qaeda shift money around the world. Al Barakaat is a group of money-wiring and communication companies owned by a friend and supporter of Osama bin Laden.","1429":"On a day that the Pakistani government cracked down on the daily anti-American news conferences given by the Taliban's ambassador in Islamabad, Osama bin Laden appeared to find a new avenue of propaganda: children.","143":"Officials said that the Algerian police have been questioning Mr. Dahoumane not only about his activities with Mr. Ressam before the millennial celebrations in Canada and the United States, but also about his possible links to a terrorist network believed to be headed by Osama bin Laden -- whom the United States has accused of the 1998 bombing of two embassies in Africa in which more than 200 people died -- or at least his knowledge of the network.","1430":"For years, Osama bin Laden has pointed to the American presence in the Persian Gulf region as the primary justification for attacks against the West. He has said that 'infidel forces' have no place on the Arabian peninsula and that the governments that harbor them should be toppled.","1431":"Mr. Nada said he believed that he was a victim of guilt by association because he is a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and has had members of Osama bin Laden's immensely wealthy family as clients. 'I have been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood for 50 years,' he said. 'That is no secret. But it is not a violent organization.'","1432":"The financial networks are called Al Barakaat and Al Taqwa, and President Bush said they did far more than move cash. The groups, with a presence in more than 40 countries, also financed the movement of arms, provided secure communications and served as a network for Osama bin Laden to transmit intelligence and instructions to terrorist cells in the loosely linked Al Qaeda organization, government officials said.","1433":"SPEAKING FOR BIN LADEN -- Osama bin Laden appeared to find a new avenue of propaganda: four boys said to be his sons, who were filmed brandishing weapons and speaking of the Afghans' support for the Taliban. B3","1434":"From shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States until his last appearance on Monday, the Taliban envoy, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, has conducted a wide-ranging session almost every weekday to set out the Taliban's positions on the terrorist attacks, the American demands for the surrender of Osama bin Laden and the American bombing.","1435":"It was Mr. Blair, not Mr. Bush, who released the white paper detailing the case against Osama bin Laden, and it is Mr. Blair who has traveled far more extensively since Sept. 11 -- 40,000 miles -- than Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.","1436":"By welcoming French, German, Italian and Turkish troops to the war against terrorism, the United States is shoring up international support for its campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. The addition of these forces, some of which may be involved in combat operations, will render military decision-making more cumbersome. That is an acceptable price for ensuring the diplomatic solidarity needed to sustain an extended and difficult armed campaign.","1438":"On the day after federal agents raided and padlocked five money-transfer operations in Minneapolis that the authorities say were part of a financial pipeline funneling money to Osama bin Laden, many Somalis here wanted to make one thing clear: they do not send their hard-earned money to the man who has become America's most wanted terrorist.","1439":"THE MONEY TRAIL -- The day after federal agents raided five money-transfer operations in Minneapolis that they say funneled money to Osama bin Laden, many Somali refugees in the city made one thing clear: they do not send their hard-earned money to the world's most wanted terrorist. B7","144":"Russians accuse the Taliban of involvement in the war in Chechnya. The United States is focused on the sanctuary in Afghanistan of the Saudi-born financier of militancy, Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the United States on charges of being behind the bombings of two American embassies in Africa in 1998.","1440":"Reading Mr. Friedman's column, one gets the impression that only two or three of millions of Arabs and Muslims 'had the guts' to speak out and that the others support Osama bin Laden. The worst thing for Americans would be to fall into a trap of generalizations that obscure the principled stand that the Arabs and Egypt have taken against terrorism.","1441":"Hmmm, I thought, that's not a good sign. I started to wonder: Is America the Titanic and Pakistan the iceberg we're about to hit, while we're searching for Osama bin Laden in the fog of Afghanistan? Or is Pakistan the Titanic, its president, Pervez Musharraf, the captain, America the only passengers and Afghanistan the iceberg we're about to hit?","1442":"WORRIES AT THE U.N. -- The Taliban's chief ward, Osama bin Laden, was making the United Nations nervous. Over the weekend, he issued another of his videotaped messages, this time saying the world organization had aligned itself with 'crusader' Western interests and against Muslims. Secretary General Kofi Annan is a 'criminal,' he said. And where President Bush has insisted that the United States was in a war against terror and not against Muslims, Mr. bin Laden basically said the opposite was true: that the target is Islam, not him.","1443":"Wahhabism, the puritanical Islamic sect that is strong in Saudi Arabia and is followed by Osama bin Laden, has long been an obsession of the Russian state and news media. Some Caucasus rebels studied in Saudi Arabia and identify with the Wahhabi branch. 'Wahhabism' is now a Russian code word for extremism, and is banned by several republics.","1444":"Not a word was said about the quest to hunt down Osama bin Laden, nor the attacks in the United States. So the reason the Afghan people might need help went unmentioned.","1446":"General Musharraf's support for the American campaign against Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, has enraged the militant groups and Taliban-influenced Afghan refugee groups in Pakistan, which have mounted protests throughout the country.","1447":"Despite or perhaps even because of the terrorist threat, President Bush and Mr. Zoellick made the talks a test of leadership. They say a successful outcome would show that Osama bin Laden had not succeeded in disrupting an open and interconnected world. Mr. Zoellick called the talks a mission to 'counter the revulsive destructionism of terrorism.'","1448":"At the same time, Prince Faisal made clear that Saudi Arabia fully supports the American military campaign in Afghanistan to destroy Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","1449":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 8\u2014 As scores of world leaders converge on New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly, Osama bin Laden's latest message to the world has provoked profound new security concerns for the United Nations and its global work force.","145":"Yemeni officials have told the Clinton administration that they have identified two key figures in the October bombing of the destroyer Cole, and intelligence officials say they believe that at least one of them is associated with the organization controlled by Osama bin Laden.","1450":"President Mohammad Khatami of Iran yesterday branded as extremist Osama bin Laden's version of Islam and said it did not represent the majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims.","1451":"The first important military victory of the war against terrorism seemed close at hand yesterday, with reports by Northern Alliance forces that they had taken the northern Afghanistan stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif. Capture of the city, which has been under Taliban rule, would provide an important military, psychological and political boost to the American-led campaign to drive the Taliban from power and bring Osama bin Laden to justice. But because the city is separated from the southern population centers of Afghanistan by nearly impassable mountains, the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif is not likely to lead to the Taliban's rapid collapse.","1452":"In an interview with a Pakistani newspaper, Osama bin Laden said he had chemical and nuclear weapons and 'if America used them against us, we reserve the right to use them.'","1453":"IRAN'S LEADER -- President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, in his first interview with an American publication since assuming the presidency in 1997, branded as extremist Osama bin Laden's version of Islam and said it did not represent the majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims. A1","1454":"General Dostum has made and broken other alliances. He fought against, then joined the leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was murdered, apparently in a conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden, on Sept. 9.","1455":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov. 9\u2014 Foreign fighters allied with Osama bin Laden and trained in Afghan camps are spearheading the Taliban's resistance to American and allied attacks, according to military and intelligence officials in Pakistan and the United States.","1456":"The successful attack on Mazar-i-Sharif was a direct result of the Bush administration's decision to aid the Northern Alliance. The city, in fact, was a target from the opening days of the American military campaign, when a garrison of Arab and other foreign fighters recruited by Osama bin Laden was bombed.","1457":"Establishing what could become a pattern of direct response by videotape to statements by President Bush, Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant said yesterday that the president had lied in a speech on Thursday night when he said the United States was destroying Al Qaeda and the Taliban forces.","1458":"But he acknowledged possibly antagonizing some of same Muslim nations whose support Washington wants in the fight against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. Pro-immigration and Muslim groups in this country were certainly upset. This amounted to profiling by religion and nationality, they said. Not to mention sex.","1459":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Saturday, Nov. 10\u2014 A leading Pakistani newspaper published an interview with Osama bin Laden today in which he said, 'We have chemical and nuclear weapons as a deterrent and if America used them against us, we reserve the right to use them.'","146":"Yemeni officials have told American officials that they have identified two important figures in the bombing of the Cole, and intelligence officials say they have established links between them and the terror group controlled by Osama bin Laden. A22","1460":"CAMBRIDGE, Mass.\u2014 Why can't we watch Osama bin Laden on American television? White House officials called on network executives last month, after a videotaped statement by Mr. bin Laden was widely broadcast on Oct. 7. The administration persuaded the networks that self-censorship was necessary to the war effort. The tapes of Mr. bin Laden were merely propaganda, it was suggested. Besides, he might be using the tapes to send hidden messages to terrorists, although no evidence was offered to support this notion. Network officials agreed to treat future broadcasts with care.","1461":"PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS -- President Bush tried to cast the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in the broadest global context as he told the United Nations that every member country was a potential target of terrorism and that the responsibility for fighting to stop it was 'binding on every nation with a place in this chamber.' Mr. Bush's speech, his first to the General Assembly, opened two days of intense diplomacy to enlist more support for his war against terrorism. A1","1462":"John Sohm, 30, a carpenter in Memphis, is one of those who says he is not getting enough answers. 'I don't think we're being filled in much at all,' he said. 'What exactly are we doing over there? I think I understand the goal, but what is our long-term plan? All I hear Bush saying is we are going to get him, Osama bin Laden.'","1464":"Benjamin Weiser reported in The New York Times on Dec. 22, 2000, that a former U.S. Army sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed, testified to a federal grand jury investigating the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden used the technique: 'In 1997, [Mohamed] told the F.B.I. about networks of terrorists,' wrote Weiser, 'known as 'sleepers,' who lie low for years but do not need to be told what to do.' The reporter quoted an F.B.I. document released in court holding that Mohamed knew 'that there are hundreds of 'sleepers' or 'submarines' in place who don't fit neatly into the terrorist profile.'","1465":"UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 10\u2014 President Bush tried to cast the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in the broadest global context today as he told the United Nations that every member country was a potential target of terrorism and that responsibility for fighting it was 'binding on every nation with a place in this chamber.'","1466":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 10\u2014 The United States has identified sites in Afghanistan that are suspected of involvement in Osama bin Laden's efforts to acquire and produce chemical and biological weapons, but none have been bombed since the military campaign began, according to American military and intelligence officials.","1467":"Asked tonight whether he believed a claim by Osama bin Laden that the Qaeda organization possesses nuclear and chemical weapons, Mr. Putin said such statements were generally made in an attempt to sow panic. He said he was certain that none of Russia's weapons of mass destruction had fallen into terrorist hands.","1468":"'All I want to do is make a better future,' said Mr. Nassr, more interested in discussing the veal parmigiano than Osama bin Laden.","1469":"The northern border was given little attention as a terrorist entry point until two years ago, when Ahmed Ressam, an operative of Osama bin Laden, was caught trying to enter the United States with bomb-making material in the trunk of his rental car. Mr. Ressam was later convicted in a failed plot to blow up the Los Angeles International Airport.","147":"In another ruling yesterday, Judge Sand upheld the government's decision to seek the death penalty against two other defendants, if they are convicted in the case, which stems from the nearly simultaneous bombings on Aug. 7, 1998, of the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A total of four defendants are scheduled to be tried on Jan. 3 in a broad terrorism conspiracy that includes the embassy attacks. The blasts, which the authorities believe were masterminded by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 4,000.","1471":"BIN LADEN'S POSSIBLE ARSENAL -- For the United States, the primary target in this war is of course Osama bin Laden, who told a Pakistani newspaper that he had nuclear and chemical weapons and was prepared to use them if, by his logic, the Americans forced his hand.","1472":"Jane Lahr, seated for her first cut since Sept. 11, held forth about goddess power, her own contribution to the campaign against Osama bin Laden. 'The cultures that did this to us don't care about the female principle,' she said, as a stylist named Brian Devine sculptured a cascade of Rita Hayworth waves. 'If I had my druthers, we'd be dropping estrogen on Afghanistan, not bombs.' A few chairs down, Skyler Madison, a life coach and hypnotherapist, finished a $250 regimen that included hair, eyebrows, nails and lots of talk about the war; she would have to go elsewhere for her Botox and collagen treatments. As her part of the war effort, she asked for bangs like Paula Zahn's. 'All of this is very high maintenance,' she said. Though she cut back after Sept. 11, she said: 'Certain things you just can't stop. Like nothing would keep me from my hair coloring.' And so it went.","1473":"KUWAIT, Nov. 10\u2014 Osama bin Laden is not being portrayed as a hero in the Arab media. But neither is the American war in Afghanistan being portrayed as anything heroic, or even wise or necessary.","1474":"It is on just this Arab -- or, better, Islamic -- street that President Bush must fight in his war against Osama bin Laden and his terrorists, a battleground for the public's mood that may ultimately be more important than the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan. And this is not only a war between Mr. Bush and Mr. bin Laden; leaders of countries from Egypt to Pakistan must also weigh how to court and contain the street -- how much they can repress expressions of hatred for America when their countries are, however conditionally, American allies in the war against terrorism.","1475":"These days, the class is focusing on terrorism, Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan as well as the entire volatile region of South Asia. As a final project, students will be split into groups and assigned a country like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Britain, China or Russia -- and they will have to explain that country's role in the coalition fighting terrorism and show an understanding of the nation and its policies in this conflict.","1476":"WASHINGTON\u2014 AT the embassy bombings trial earlier this year, Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network looked nothing like the far-reaching and sophisticated terror organization that most Americans have feared and loathed since Sept. 11. Instead, Al Qaeda Inc. resembled a start-up company struggling to adapt to the ever-changing rules of the new economy.","1477":"To reach foreign audiences, especially in the Islamic world, the State Department brought in Charlotte Beers, a former advertising executive, who is using her marketing skills to try to make American values as much a brand name as McDonald's hamburgers or Ivory soap. The department's efforts are also meant to counter the propaganda of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1478":"The weak Somalian government, just a year old and not recognized by most of the world, has vowed to root out terrorism and says it takes seriously American allegations that fundamentalists inside Somalia have aided Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Still, Somalia is wincing at the American reprisals and is not persuaded that its struggling citizens are secretly planning attacks against the United States.","1479":"But experts on the Middle East said Washington did not want to shift its policies in a way that could allow Osama bin Laden to claim that his terror attacks had compelled Washington to address Palestinian grievances. Thus the administration has sought to balance its approach, and to avoid too extensive an initiative.","148":"Mr. al-'Owhali may take the witness stand on Thursday when the hearing resumes, his lawyers have told the judge. He and three others face trial on Jan. 3 in a broad terrorism conspiracy that the authorities say was masterminded by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","1481":"In mid-May, two of Saddam's secret service agents arrived at the clinic of Dr. Mohammed Khayal, Baghdad's leading kidney specialist. The doctor hurriedly packed a bag and was escorted to a government car. Three days later, he was returned, and the building was soon abuzz with the word that Saddam's Dr. Khayal had been to Afghanistan where his patient was Osama bin Laden.","1482":"Mr. Putin gave a crucial boost to relations after Sept. 11 by providing strong support for Mr. Bush's campaign against international terrorism. He cleared the way for American military forces to use bases in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Central Asian nations that border Afghanistan and were once Soviet republics. Moscow has also helped to arm guerrilla forces in Afghanistan. In the talks that begin tomorrow, the two leaders can enhance their cooperation against Osama bin Laden and other terrorist threats and work to narrow their differences on arms control and other matters.","1483":"Officials of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body for monitoring nuclear programs, are deeply skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim, in an interview published in Pakistan on Friday, that he possesses nuclear weapons.","1484":"ATOMIC THREAT -- Nuclear weapons monitors are skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim that he possesses nuclear weapons. But given the vulnerability of material in the former Soviet Union, the increasing professionalism of nuclear smuggling and the relative ease of fabricating a primitive weapon, they cannot rule it out. B1","1485":"Officials of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body for monitoring nuclear programs, are deeply skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim, in an interview published in Pakistan on Friday, that he possesses nuclear weapons.","1486":"The reason for a southern strategy is clear. Washington needs a southern Afghan alliance that will provide intelligence and assistance to American and British Special Forces to hunt down Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden, a senior administration official said.","1487":"'Even though the terrorists themselves may be middle class and Osama bin Laden may be rich, they get their enormous support from people in poverty,' Mr. Conway said. He said his organization planned to continue its efforts to alleviate poverty and hunger and to provide health care around the world -- not just around Afghanistan and the Middle East but in Africa and elsewhere.","1488":"A former F.B.I. antiterror official who was killed at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 complained bitterly last summer that the United States was unwilling to confront Saudi Arabia over Osama bin Laden and that oil ruled American foreign policy, according to a new book published in France.","1489":"The two main thrusts were being carried out by Zarbati assault forces, backed by tanks. The elite units were created by Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance leader who was assassinated in September by two men believed to be connected to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network.","149":"The United States closed its consulates in Istanbul and the southern city of Adana for what an embassy official in Ankara said were security reviews. The official declined to say what led to the review or whether there had been a specific threat. The embassy remained open because it is considered more secure. American officials have expressed concern recently about possible attacks sponsored by the exiled Saudi Osama bin Laden, who Washington believes was behind the 1998 bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Douglas Frantz (NYT)","1490":"They have also questioned the students themselves, asking about their views on Osama bin Laden, the names of their favorite restaurants and their plans for after graduation.","1491":"What is more worrisome than costs is Osama bin Laden's new claim that he has nuclear weapons, ready to go. On Sunday talk programs, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld were skeptical. But Russian officials acknowledge lax security at their nuclear storage facilities, and say they know of two terrorist stakeouts and one loss of fissionable material. Atomic energy officials in Vienna say that, given the relative ease of fabricating a nuclear weapon, nuclear terrorism cannot be ruled out.","1492":"So far, no trademark applications have been filed using 'Taliban' or 'Al Qaeda.' But there are several incorporating variants of the name Osama bin Laden into slogans on clothing, knickknacks or bumper stickers. These include 'Osama -- Can you see the bombs bursting in air?' 'Trash Bin Laden,' 'Bin Laden to rest,' 'Bin there, bombed that,' and 'Osama, Yo Mama.'","1493":"After the immigration service reported that the two were already in the country, the F.B.I. was notified and began searching for them. When their names showed up on the passenger manifest for Flight 77, the information provided one of the first clues pointing to a terrorist operation linked to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","1494":"ALTERED BIN LADEN -- Hamid Mir, a Pakistani reporter who is the first journalist known to have met Osama bin Laden since the Sept. 11 attacks, says Mr. bin Laden is 'a changed man,' tense and aging.

And now that the Northern Alliance has swept across northern Afghanistan, the White House is calculating that the advance will send a resounding message.","1497":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan\u2014 You need only spend an afternoon walking through the Storytellers' Bazaar here in Peshawar, a few miles from the Afghan border, to understand that America needs to do its business in Afghanistan -- eliminate Osama bin Laden and his Taliban pro tectors -- as quickly as possible and get out of here. This is not a neighborhood where we should linger. This is not Mr. Rogers's neighborhood.","1498":"'They brought Osama bin Laden to this country,' said Hashmatullah, seated in Habibullah's Restaurant. 'We will kill them.'","1499":"One omission from the statements appears to be Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have employed often brutal tactics in their fight against Muslim rebels cast by Mr. Putin as Islamic extremists akin to Osama bin Laden.","15":"A suspect in an aborted terror plot, Mohambedou Ould Slahi, who is thought to be linked to the Osama bin Laden network, was arrested in Mauritania, federal officials said. A4","150":"The two men thought to have carried out the attack have been identified by Yemeni officials as Arab Afghans and as having families with roots in the province of Hadhramaut, more than 400 miles east of Sana, the capital. Hadhramaut is the also ancestral home of the family of Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist.","1500":"The power vacuum in Kabul seems to be enticing Northern Alliance forces to enter the city despite their promises to remain outside. The alliance is little more than a coalition of convenience among chieftains of the main ethnic minority groups of northern Afghanistan. While it has been greeted warmly in the northern towns it has captured, it cannot count on a similar reception in multi-ethnic Kabul. Some of the alliance's leaders held power there in the early 1990's, an unpleasant experience for the capital's residents. In addition to human rights abuses and egregious misgovernment, incessant warfare killed more than 30,000 residents and pounded much of the city into rubble. A repeat performance could strengthen the Taliban's grip over their southern stronghold around Kandahar, where Osama bin Laden has found sanctuary.","1501":"America's most potent weapon against Osama bin Laden is democracy. The day we support it for all the people of the world, he and his barbarians are doomed.","1502":"After the immigration service reported that the two were already in the country, the F.B.I. was notified and began searching for them.

We have to capture Osama bin Laden and quell terrorism, so the Bush administration is making compromises and offering carrots where it once turned up its nose.","1506":"The Pentagon still has no plans to send large numbers of American troops into Afghanistan at this point, officials said, even though Taliban leaders and Osama bin Laden remain at large.","1509":"Foreign affairs, which accounted for 45 percent of television network newscasts in the 1970's, was down to 13.5 percent by 1995, according to a Harvard study in 1997. Other surveys show that newspapers had cut foreign news by four-fifths over the same period. According to Pat Mitchell, the president of the Public Broadcasting Service, there were three times as many stories about 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' last year as there were about Osama bin Laden. No wonder so few Americans knew the story of radical Islam. Before Sept. 11, prominent federal commissions predicting terrorist attacks and breakdowns in airport security had hardly made a dent in a news culture overdosing on JonBenet and sex scandals. Only weeks before the attack, some of the same high-powered network correspondents who would be covering Washington's search for the murderers of thousands of people had been filing breathless nightly reports on the vicissitudes of Gary Condit, who hadn't even been charged with a crime.","151":"President Ali Abdullah Saleh said he would support American efforts to seize Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I's most wanted terror suspect, if Mr. bin Laden were found to have inspired or directed the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen on Oct. 12.

But now people who want to give the Social Security surplus to campaign donors think they can get away with it, because they can blame Osama bin Laden for future budget shortfalls.","1511":"'Any person who goes hither and thither is like a slaughtered chicken that falls and dies,' Mullah Omar said in a radio address. 'You should regroup yourselves, resist and fight.' He did not refer to his guest, the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, whose whereabouts remain unclear.","1512":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 13\u2014 Nearly half of Afghanistan tumbled out of the hands of the Taliban today in a dramatic turn in the five-week-old war that shifted the focus of military operations to the south, intensified the hunt for Osama bin Laden and left unanswered the overarching political question of who will govern Afghanistan.","1513":"Another magazine showed Maradona at his recent birthday party wearing an Osama bin Laden mask, one of several signs that he may be growing more anti-American.","1514":"Mr. Bush signed the order allowing for the military tribunals shortly before leaving this afternoon for his ranch in Crawford, Tex. White House officials said the order did not create a military tribunal or a list of terrorists to be tried. Instead, they said, it was an 'option' that the president would have should Osama bin Laden or his associates in Al Qaeda be captured. If the tribunals were created, it would be the first time since World War II that such an approach was used, officials said.","1516":"BIN LADEN'S TRAIL -- American intelligence officials said that Osama bin Laden was on the run with his security forces in southern Afghanistan. The officials said he hadn't tried to leave the country.

It was the second time in two months that Spain had dismantled a cell connected to Mr. bin Laden.","1518":"NEW EVIDENCE ON BIN LADEN -- Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain made public new evidence that he said showed Osama bin Laden acknowledging that he was behind the Sept. 11 attacks. B5","1519":"But downtown Riyadh is broadcasting a more radical message these days, one difficult to discern amid the country's stifling layers of censorship but that takes as its target both the regime's corruption and its alliance with the United States. Since Sept. 11 deep fissures have opened in that relationship. Fifteen of that morning's hijackers were Saudis; their faces haunt this documentary like unanswered questions. And Osama bin Laden, though an outcast, is one among 50 siblings belonging to a leading Saudi establishment family.","152":"A Turkish newspaper, Milliyet, said this week that American officials were worried about possible links between the Turkish religious terror group Hizbullah and the exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden.","1520":"MADRID, Nov. 14\u2014 The Spanish police, who dismantled a radical recruitment cell this week after it was linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, said they were searching for another three Islamic militants who appeared in a video seized in police raids on Tuesday.","1521":"Prof. Phillip B. Heymann of Harvard Law School, a former deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, said he believed that the government wanted the military tribunal because of a fear that it might not be able to convict Osama bin Laden or other suspected terrorists in civilian courts.","1522":"LONDON, Nov. 14\u2014 Prime Minister Tony Blair made public today new evidence in which he said Osama bin Laden acknowledged for the first time that he was behind the suicide hijackings of Sept. 11.","1523":"They have blocked roads to try to trap Taliban and Al Qaeda commanders. They have marked potential landing strips for American forces and conducted reconnaissance missions. And they have searched for traces of Osama bin Laden and Taliban leaders.","1524":"This time people were very interested, particularly as they faced the prospect of what to do should Osama bin Laden or his associates in Al Qaeda be captured. Administration officials have said they did not want a long, public American trial of Mr. bin Laden that could turn him into a martyr or cause further terrorism in his name.","1525":"The last thing we want to see is American youths losing their lives for a worthless cause. Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden will be dealt with by the local tribesmen in Afghanistan while the remnants of the Taliban will wither away in the coming winter. We absolutely do not need any Americans on the ground.","1526":"SHIFTING TACTICS -- With the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban forces having moved so stunningly fast to capture about 80 percent of the country, American commanders shifted tactics. Expect fewer air strikes against Taliban troops in the field, they said, and a more intense hunt for enemy leaders, above all Osama bin Laden. More than 100 American commandos were said to be in southern Afghanistan, carrying out covert operations against officials of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist network.","1527":"It was the worst Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence since Oct. 8, when Mr. Arafat's forces opened fire on demonstrators in the Gaza Strip, killing two, to stop a protest in support of Osama bin Laden and against the war in Afghanistan. Then as now, Mr. Arafat was seeking to comply with what he perceived to be American desires.","1528":"An attack was ordered on Kabul Tuesday after the United States received 'compelling evidence of Al Qaeda personnel' inside, a Defense Department official said today. Officials presume that all those inside were killed. But the official dismissed reports that Osama bin Laden had been spotted during the recent days of confusion.","1529":"The central targets of the five-week-old American operation, Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda lieutenants, as well Mullah Muhammad Omar and other leaders of the Taliban, remained at large.","153":"SANA, Yemen, Dec. 14\u2014 President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen said today that he would support American efforts to seize Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I's most wanted terrorism suspect, if Mr. bin Laden is found to have inspired or directed the Oct. 12 bombing of the destroyer Cole, which killed 17 American sailors, wounded 39 others and heavily damaged the ship.","1530":"But let's get to the target that this blunderbuss order is intended to hit. Here's the big worry in Washington now: What do we do if Osama bin Laden gives himself up? A proper trial like that Israel afforded Adolf Eichmann, it is feared, would give the terrorist a global propaganda platform. Worse, it would be likely to result in widespread hostage-taking by his followers to protect him from the punishment he deserves.","1531":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Nov. 15\u2014 Materials left behind in a compound used by Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, suggest that the terrorist group may have been trying to develop chemical arms and other unconventional weapons.","1532":"The temptation to employ extrajudicial proceedings to deal with Osama bin Laden and his henchmen is understandable. The horrific attacks of Sept. 11 give credence to the notion that these foreign terrorists are uniquely malevolent outlaws, undeserving of American constitutional protections. Military tribunals can act swiftly, anywhere, averting the security problems that a high-profile trial in New York or Washington could pose.","1533":"'Holy War, Inc.,' Sunday's installment of 'National Geographic Explorer,' complements 'Unholy War' in more than its title: it begins in Pakistan with a classroom of little boys being trained for a jihad. Based on Peter L. Bergen's new book, 'Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden,' it relies more heavily than Ms. Shah's films on Western experts and reporting. And although it is disappointing and perfunctory next to Mr. Bergen's slim yet thorough book, it has a thoughtful, opinionated quality rare among current documentaries.","1534":"Asked whether Osama bin Laden might be more likely to attack because of Taliban losses in Afghanistan, Mr. Ridge said 'common sense' dictated that 'if you are putting pressure on your enemy in one area or one venue, they may choose to act out in a separate area, in a different venue.'","1535":"But by last year, when a son was born to Sara, one of 11 al-Munaif children, the young woman did not hesitate to choose a name meant to send a very different signal to the West. The little boy is Osama, after Osama bin Laden.","1536":"At first, it seemed possible that the investigation into the attacks might keep her in the job even longer. Over more than eight years, Ms. White had developed into the nation's pre-eminent prosecutor of international terrorism, and had overseen the investigation of Osama bin Laden for more than half a decade.","1537":"'I don't think anyone wants to see Osama bin Laden brought before a court here to be defended by Johnnie Cochran,' he said.","1538":"If the assertions are true, the prisoners could provide valuable intelligence about the location of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, chief of the Taliban.","1539":"Re 'Why Are We Hiding bin Laden?' (Op-Ed, Nov. 11): Robert H. Giles seems to think that we Americans are missing out on some important news by not seeing Osama bin Laden's videotapes on national television; that Al Jazeera is a model news organization and that Osama bin Laden has some serious political messages we should be hearing.","154":"The judge's ruling means that Mr. El-Hage will be expected to go to trial on Jan. 3 along with three co-defendants on charges that they participated in a global terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Prosecutors say the conspiracy included the August 1998 attacks on the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands. All four of the defendants have pleaded not guilty.","1540":"You suggest that the United States should be part of a multinational force to establish security in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban by the Northern Alliance (editorial, Nov. 14). Let's be honest. Our only real interest in Afghanistan is to eliminate it as a base for Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorist organization. Once that is accomplished, why should our troops be stationed in a country that holds little, if any, strategic interest for the United States?","1542":"The Sunday Telegraph of London was the only news organization to report that Osama bin Laden had justified the Sept. 11 attacks in a recent video circulating among his supporters. Four days later, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain cited that video as evidence of Mr. bin Laden's complicity.","1543":"For the United States, the brass ring is capturing Osama bin Laden and destroying his network, Al Qaeda. He remained an elusive target, but he left traces behind in a compound in Kabul, where materials suggested that Al Qaeda was working on chemical weapons and other unconventional arms.","1544":"A Clinton administration appointee, Ms. White stayed on after President Bush took office so she could complete work on the trial of four men accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the bombings of two American embassies in 1998. All four were convicted last spring and sentenced last month to life in prison.","1545":"And crucially: Where is Osama bin Laden? His protector, Mullah Muhammad Omar, is still at large, issuing dire threats against the United States, and so is much of Al Qaeda's network, in Afghanistan and elsewhere.","1546":"The mullah's language in the interview was far closer to that of Osama bin Laden, which indicated, experts said, that as the Taliban crumbled, it was also splitting into sharply divided groups. Mullah Omar leads the hard-line faction, as he has in the past. But there are moderates whom Mr. Karzai is appealing to and getting support from, according to his supporters.","1547":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u2014 Although it was never his intention, Osama bin Laden has triggered the most serious debate in years, among Muslims, about Islam's ability to adapt to modernity. In Arab states this debate is still muted. But in Pakistan and other Muslim countries with a relatively free press, writers are raising it openly and bluntly. Nothing could be more important.","1549":"Muhammad Atef, an Al Qaeda military commander who was reported killed in the American bombing raids near Kabul, held a unique place in Osama bin Laden's hierarchy, officials say: he was military commander and a member of Al Qaeda's ruling shura council, as well as an in-law of Mr. bin Laden.","155":"But Sheik Muqbel is no stranger to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which knows him as a seminal influence on Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorism suspect. Long before the Oct. 12 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Aden harbor, 400 miles away at Yemen's southern tip -- an attack that investigators have linked in numerous but inconclusive ways to what is believed to be a terrorist network run by Mr. bin Laden -- the F.B.I. saw Sheik Muqbel's study centers, particularly at Dammaj, as incubators for the holy war that Mr. bin Laden has declared against the United States.","1550":"The apparent Qaeda presence in a Taliban defense ministry building suggested that Osama bin Laden's organization and the radical Islamic government were closely linked.","1551":"The Pentagon said it had received credible reports that in a separate action against the Qaeda terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, one of its most senior members, Muhammad Atef, was killed by American bombs in an air strike near Kabul earlier this week. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that he had been briefed on reports that 'seem authoritative' indicating that Mr. Atef was killed, but he cautioned that it was too soon to say definitively that Mr. Atef was dead.","1552":"Their bombing may not have hit the big prey, but American officials say it will have to do for now. They said airstrikes in Kabul were believed to have killed Muhammad Atef, one of Osama bin Laden's most trusted aides and a man believed to have helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In short, the Americans say the bin Laden terror network, Al Qaeda, is hurting, though it remains a decided threat.","1553":"An important consequence of this imminent shift is that America and its allies can soon concentrate on hunting down Osama bin Laden and his chief confederates. One important success in this area may already have been achieved with the reported death of Muhammad Atef, a top bin Laden deputy, in an airstrike this week. It is imperative that the remaining leaders of Al Qaeda be kept from fleeing Afghanistan or its immediate vicinity. Pursuing them in the snowy mountains and cave redoubts of Central or South Asia will be difficult enough. Finding them if they flee to the jungles of Southeast Asia or sanctuaries in Chechnya or East Africa would be considerably harder.","1554":"Prosecutors say Mr. Ressam has provided a wealth of information about terrorist training camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, details of operations and the names of terrorist cell members. Last summer, Mr. Ressam also testified in a trial in Manhattan against another man charged in the plot, Mokhtar Haouari, who was convicted of conspiracy.","1555":"An article on Thursday about Prime Minister Tony Blair's description of a videotape that he said showed Osama bin Laden acknowledging for the first time that he was behind the terror attacks of Sept. 11 referred to the tape imprecisely. While it had not been shown on television, The Sunday Telegraph of London published an article about it last Sunday. It was not unpublicized.","1556":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 16\u2014 One of Osama bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants has reportedly been killed in a bombing raid, American officials said today. His death, the officials said, would be an important success in a global campaign that has curtailed Al Qaeda's ability to mount large-scale terrorist operations.","1557":"BIN LADEN AIDE REPORTED KILLED -- One of Osama bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants, Muhammad Atef, has reportedly been killed in a bombing raid, American officials said. His death, they said, would be an important success in a global campaign that has curtailed Al Qaeda's ability to mount large-scale terrorist operations. A1","1558":"The retreat would end the seven-year reign of the extremist Islamic group, which gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","1559":"But if the public relations war is as important as the military war, as our allies and the administration insist, such trials would give the enemy a victory of enormous proportions. President Mohammad Khatami of Iran denounced the Sept. 11 attacks, but said he needed evidence that Osama bin Laden was responsible. Presenting evidence in secret will convince no one and will only fortify Mr. bin Laden's propaganda. And military executions of convicted terrorists after such trials will create a new generation of martyrs.","156":"Since coming to power in 1996, the Taliban has spun a web of insurgency and terror reaching into the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, western China and Indian-ruled Kashmir. The Taliban also provides a safe haven for the Saudi terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, whose associates have been linked to the 1998 bombing of American embassies in Africa and this year's attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen. Mr. bin Laden is the most prominent of the 'Arab Afghans' -- militant Muslims from the Arab world recruited by American and Pakistani intelligence agencies to fight the Soviets in the 1980's war. Arab veterans of Afghanistan have since been tied to terrorist plots across the Mideast and North Africa.","1560":"Could Osama bin Laden be an example of the new millennium's dictator?","1561":"Al Jazeera, which claims a global audience of 35 million Arabic-speaking viewers, may not officially be the Osama bin Laden Channel -- but he is clearly its star, as I learned during an extended viewing of the station's programming in October. The channel's graphics assign him a lead role: there is bin Laden seated on a mat, his submachine gun on his lap; there is bin Laden on horseback in Afghanistan, the brave knight of the Arab world. A huge, glamorous poster of bin Laden's silhouette hangs in the background of the main studio set at Al Jazeera's headquarters in Doha, the capital city of Qatar.","1562":"Both books cover events from the fall of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul in 1992 through the Taliban's key victories in 1998, which drove opposition forces into the mountainous northeast of the country. And both are filled with the dramatic moments, ironies and political intrigues that color the Taliban's rise. We read about idiosyncratic former mujahedeen commanders like Ahmed Shah Massoud of the Northern Alliance, the legendary fighter who won over many Western journalists with his good looks, charm and apparent humble piety and who was assassinated on Sept. 9 (in an attack believed to be carried out by agents of Osama bin Laden). We hear all about the Taliban's erstwhile supporters: the Pakistani intelligence services, regional smugglers, drug kingpins, well-financed Islamic extremist organizations, Osama bin Laden and reportedly even two oil companies interested in building pipelines in Afghanistan.","1563":"11 4 *THE NEW JACKALS, by Simon Reeve.

This picked up on the repeated uses of the phrase at the embattled Defense Department regarding the air campaign in Afghanistan. Asked if he could be sure that Osama bin Laden would not try to escape to another country, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld replied: 'I can't be sure of anything in life. In the fog of war, it is a confused picture on the ground. Half of the 24 hours is darkness, there's a bit of a problem with dust in that region and weather's going to get bad soon. You can't be sure of anything.' Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, later chimed in with 'In the fog of war, things happen that you don't expect.' Twelve years before, a predecessor of his at that job, Adm. William Crowe, extended that uncertainty principle; he said that his Pentagon officers 'hear a lot about the fog of war, but they've also learned that the fog of peacetime is rather mind-boggling as well.'","1568":"The astonishment at the rapid turn of events was palpable. Just as Americans were staggered nine weeks ago to find their homeland vulnerable to terrorism on a horrifying scale, now they had reason to question old fears of frustration and quagmire. Overnight, it seemed, their allies were in Kabul, before even the Bush administration wanted them to be. A key aide to Osama bin Laden was reported dead. The Taliban were on the run. While nobody could claim that terrorism itself had been defeated, this was clearly a turning point.","1569":"Lelyveld's journey to Gaza, Cairo and Hamburg in search of what made Sept. 11 possible is thought-provoking but seems incomplete. Because Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 airplane hijackers were apparently born and reared in Saudi Arabia, I believe that including the perspective of young Saudis would also have been relevant.","157":"But the F.B.I. has long considered the centers to be incubators for the holy war that Osama bin Laden has declared against the United States. And in a region where the United States is still considered 'the Great Satan,' the best advice to Americans would be: stay away.","1570":"Just three years ago, Khartoum was on the receiving end of American missile attacks, a response to the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 for which Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda were blamed.","1571":"At the same time, after a meeting of the National Security Council conducted from President Bush's ranch here this morning, the administration also vowed to vigorously prosecute the war against remaining Taliban holdouts. It pledged, as well, to refocus its efforts on crushing Al Qaeda, the terrorist network, and its surviving leaders, who apparently include Osama bin Laden.","1572":"But the Sept. 11 attacks have focused new attention on the family, not least because the ideology of Osama bin Laden is rooted in the Arabian peninsula, his hatreds at least partly inspired by close military and other ties between the royals and the United States. Furthermore, tensions between the cost of the family and the needs of the people always rise at a time of sinking oil prices, like those seen in the last week.","1573":"The filmmakers also interview Ahmed Shah Massoud, the 'lion of Panjshir,' a mujahedeen leader killed on Sept. 9 by assassins believed to be associates of Osama bin Laden. Vikram Parekh, a researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights Watch, admires the film but is troubled by its uncritical stance toward Massoud's Northern Alliance. 'The film shows people who are victims of indiscriminate bombing by the Taliban,' he said. 'But it never mentions that Massoud's forces had also carried out such attacks on Kabul, without regard for civilian casualties.' Though the Taliban's record of human rights violations far outweighs that of the Northern Alliance, 'all sides have committed abuses,' he said. 'And neither has demonstrated a popular mandate to govern.'","1574":"Last week, the Pentagon released its first formal estimates of the cost thus far of waging war in Afghanistan. The biggest expense: $634 million to deploy more than 50,000 American soldiers, sailors and airmen, three carrier battle groups and more than 400 aircraft into the region. As the United States dispatches more ground troops to hunt down Osama bin Laden, secure and rebuild Afghan airports, and help deliver humanitarian aid, the price of the conflict is expected to rise even beyond the estimated $1 billion a month price tag. Following is brief per-item, per-hour look at why Enduring Freedom doesn't come cheap. JAMES DAO","1575":"It was an important break. But the names and address -- Marienstrasse 54 -- suddenly seemed familiar, German investigators say, and then they realized why: in 1998 and 1999, they had those same men and that same apartment under surveillance because of suspected links to an operative for Osama bin Laden.","1577":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 18\u2014 With the rapid collapse of the Taliban, the United States has intensified its pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his network, adding more commandos to the chase and aiming more airstrikes at hide-outs near the border with Pakistan, officials said today.","1578":"In an intriguing twist, five Yemeni women were detained on Saturday as they tried to cross into southwestern Pakistan at the Chaman border gate, United Nations and other officials said. The women were not identified, but their exit from Afghanistan is a reminder of the close links between Osama bin Laden and Yemen.","1579":"Her husband lacks such a clear mission. His friends say he is exasperated because he views himself as ideally equipped to be president at a time of crisis. Beyond that, Mr. Clinton now has to defend himself from the charge that he did not do enough to capture Osama bin Laden.","158":"In this new system, states, and the balance of power between them, still matter -- whether it is America balancing China or NATO balancing Russia. But now there are more actors to balance. In addition to states, there are the 'supermarkets' -- the 25 largest global financial markets -- and the 'super-empowered people,' from terrorists like Osama bin Laden to activists like Jody Williams, who organized a global ban on land mines using e-mail.","1580":"MADRID, Nov. 18\u2014 A Spanish investigative judge today formally charged eight Arab men living in Spain with participation in terrorism-related crimes, contending in an order that sent the men back to jail that he had seen considerable evidence indicating that they were members of Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda.","1581":"Mr. Woodward's attributions seem to advertise his access. An article on Oct. 11 began 'Osama bin Laden has provided an estimated $100 million in cash and military assistance to the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan over the last five years, making bin Laden the single greatest supporter of the Afghan regime, according to intelligence information presented recently to President Bush and his senior national security advisers.'","1582":"HUNTING BIN LADEN -- With the rapid collapse of the Taliban, the United States has intensified its pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his network, adding more commandos and aiming more airstrikes at hide-outs near the border with Pakistan.

As that is accomplished, we turn to what the Bush people call 'Phase II' -- the dangerously unfinished business of eliminating the threat from nuclear and biological weapons in Iraq. Baghdad is now the world center of state terrorism. Only Saddam has both the capacity and the demonstrated will to destroy entire cities and launch worldwide epidemics.","1584":"The Kremlin has branded all rebels as terrorists and waged a publicity campaign to link them to Islamic extremist groups, including Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden.","1585":"From the western part of the country to the east, control of the strategic cities passed in less than a week to the same warlords who fled from the Taliban up to six years ago. The relatively popular Ismail Khan reinstalled himself as the governor of Herat, a cultural and trading center; the ruthless Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum is back in power in northern Mazar-i-Sharif; and Haji Abdul Qadir, who let Osama bin Laden stay in his province in 1996, emerged as the victor this weekend after the Taliban fled the southern center of Jalalabad.","1586":"For most Americans there is no more frightening threat than terrorists with nuclear weapons. Assuming Osama bin Laden does not already have them -- the assumption most experts make -- everything possible must be done to prevent him or other terrorists from obtaining them.","1587":"Secretary of State Colin L.

Air links will be cut and an arms and military training embargo will be imposed only on the Taliban, not their armed opposition, which is supplied by Russia, Iran and India. All assets belonging to Osama bin Laden, who is thought to be living in Afghanistan, will be ordered frozen around the world.","1590":"'I'm interested in Osama bin Laden being brought to justice,' Mr. Rivera said in an interview on Friday, 'and, at the very least, in our getting revenge for mass murder.'","1591":"Attention people of Afghanistan!

There had been talk in Afghanistan of letting Mullah Omar go if Kandahar was surrendered, but Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said no. American special forces combed mountains, caves and valleys southeast of Kandahar, but did not find Osama bin Laden. American bombs continued to fall around Kunduz, but Northern Alliance troops besieging the city suspended their ground assault and tried to persuade thousands of defenders -- mostly foreigners who fanatically support the Taliban cause -- to give up.","1594":"'The people of the world may not like some of the things we do, and Osama bin Laden may hate us,' Ms. Hasan said, 'but we can show them by having the Eid stamp sell out that diversity and difference are our strengths.'","1595":"Although Mr. Bolton said that Osama bin Laden 'could have been trying to acquire a rudimentary biological weapons capability, possibly with support from a state,' he said he would not now name any countries that had assisted him.","1596":"RADIO MESSAGE -- American military aircraft began broadcasting a new radio message into Afghanistan announcing a $25 million cash reward for information leading to the location or capture of Osama bin Laden and eight Al Qaeda members.

Wahhabism is, like the ideology of the Taliban, a retrograde strain of Islam that is obsessed with the question of purity. So extreme is this purist creed that it views all non-Muslims (as well as non-Wahhabi Muslims like myself) as a form of 'pollution' of the entire 'land of Muhammad,' the phrase that Osama bin Laden uses when he talks about the presence of the American military forces in Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden not only grew up with this ideology, the staple of the Saudi school system, but he turned it against his own regime when it violated these principles during the gulf war.","1601":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20\u2014 The seven-week military campaign in Afghanistan has given the world a stark view of a new American doctrine to make war on the sources of terrorism in the world. But with the defeat of the Taliban perhaps only days away and the hunt for Osama bin Laden intensifying, the force of the American destruction of Afghan targets has sent an unambiguous warning far beyond the war theater to a number of nations that continue to provide bases and training to terrorist groups. The warning is: this could happen to you.","1602":"The war against the Taliban, the campaign against terrorism around the world, and the hunt for Osama bin Laden have all become interlocked puzzle pieces as Afghanistan teeters under the American-led assault. Where American ground troops go from here -- as soldiers, and as de facto law-enforcement agents searching for a wanted man -- is one issue. How the military campaign is perceived by governments outside Afghanistan that continue to harbor terrorists is a question that will resonate far longer.","1603":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20\u2014 The United States is prepared to send additional ground forces to capture or kill Osama bin Laden if intelligence pinpoints his location, now believed to be somewhere in a lawless corridor of former Taliban territory between Kandahar and Jalalabad in southeastern Afghanistan, Pentagon officials said today.","1604":"While the United States and its allies have yet to defeat fully the Taliban or Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization, officials said they had begun preparing a blueprint for reconstruction because nations were more likely to pledge large amounts of money now than later, before so-called donor fatigue sets in.","1605":"Washington is understandably preoccupied with the pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his supporters. But it is critically important to stabilize the situation in Kabul by sending in foreign peacekeeping troops and establishing an interim governing authority. If the capital and its environs can be secured, Afghans in surrounding regions will be more likely to participate in a power-sharing arrangement elsewhere. Political leaders in Kabul must reach out beyond the Northern Alliance forces to include representatives of the ethnic Pashtun population in the city and in southern Afghanistan.","1606":"Photos: A translated example of leaflets dropped in Afghanistan offering a bounty for Osama bin Laden and a top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Such restraints are no more or less than considerations to take into account in formulating and carrying out our strategy.","1612":"THE MULLAH AND THE TERRORIST -- Interviews with intelligence officials in Pakistan and Kabul present a picture of a growing closeness between Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader.

But he warned that military victory would now come more slowly as commandos hunted Osama bin Laden.","1614":"Taliban leaders pitched the idea to the Pakistanis two days ago. According to a Pakistani government official in Islamabad, the siege of Kunduz is especially sensitive because the relatives of some of the country's most powerful religious leaders are apparently trapped there. Northern Alliance officials say the group includes several members of Al Qaeda, the militant organization headed by Osama bin Laden.","1615":"Mr. Bush said at the Army base here that 27 of 30 Afghan provinces were no longer controlled by the Taliban and that United States and rebel forces had cut terrorists' lines of communications.

An identical map appears in a book written by Osama bin Laden declaring a holy war on the United States.","1617":"HIGH-TECH WEAPONRY -- The American forces, in any case, were more interested in the hunt for Osama bin Laden than in the fate of the lost warriors of Kunduz. With Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters still resisting in Kandahar and other pockets, the military added even more warplanes to the potent armada already in play.","1618":"American forces seeking the hide-outs of Osama bin Laden are being equipped with sophisticated new technology -- an array of sensors -- that can pierce darkness, bad weather and as much as 100 feet of solid rock, homing in on heat, magnetic fields, vibrations and other faint cues.","1619":"A man convicted in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania and also accused of assisting in an attack on a Manhattan jail guard has been transferred to a federal prison nicknamed Super Max for its high security, records show. The prison, in Florence, Colo., has held Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomber. The embassy bomber, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, above, was one of four men who received life sentences last month for their roles in a conspiracy to kill Americans. Prosecutors said the conspiracy was led by Osama bin Laden. Mr. Mohamed has denied any role in the attack on the guard.

PAGE B3","1620":"Al Qaeda's best hide-outs near here have been bombed several times by the United States, as have the Taliban's military bases. The withdrawal of the Taliban from all but southern Afghanistan gave rise to hopes that the movement, and with it Osama bin Laden's political cover, would soon vanish.","1621":"And one was downright alarming about the state of American television. 'Two networks are helping mass murderers,' President Bush appeared to say in a denunciation of Osama bin Laden.","1622":"One intelligence official said that Juma Namangani, the field commander of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which seeks to transform all of Central Asia into a single militant Islamic state, was believed to have been killed somewhere in northern Afghanistan. This reportedly happened several days before the death of Mohammed Atef, a senior lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a bombing raid last week.","1623":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 21\u2014 Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief said today that his government had seen no evidence that the Iraqi government had provided support to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. He said Saudi Arabia would not support making Iraq a military target of the war on terrorism.","1624":"But throughout most of the Muslim world, the tension between Islam and modernity remains profound. Indeed, some observers have suggested since Sept. 11 that it is the absence of a Reformation in the history of Islam that helps explain why universities in the Arab world that were once the most advanced centers of learning have often turned inward and backward. It appears clear that some of the resonance of Osama bin Laden's appeal to the Arab masses lies in the very fact that those masses have little alternative means of political expression.","1625":"For Americans, Osama bin Laden is a mass murderer. But for many young Arabs, bin Laden, even in defeat, is still Robin Hood. What attracts them to him is not his vision of the ideal Muslim society, which few would want to live in. No, what attracts them to him is his sheer defiance of everything young Arabs and Muslims detest their hypocritical rulers, Israel, U.S. dominance and their own economic backwardness. He is still the finger in the eye of the world that so many frustrated, powerless people out here would love to poke.","1626":"THE MANHUNT -- The American military continued its systematic hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan by working down a target list of cave complexes suspected of hiding Osama bin Laden, focusing particularly on areas south of Kandahar, the largest Taliban stronghold still resisting opposition forces. A1","1627":"Edward Rothstein ('Exploring the Flaws in the Notion of the 'Root Causes' of Terror,' Arts &amp; Ideas pages, Nov. 17) suggests that poverty and injustice cannot be considered among the root causes of Islamic terrorism because Osama bin Laden is a multimillionaire. By that logic, slavery could not have caused the Civil War because Abraham Lincoln was not a slave.","1628":"Encouraging governments to provide good education and health services to their citizens could help dry up the source of people willing to carry out the bidding of totalitarians like Osama bin Laden.","1629":"A no-holds-barred investigation into intelligence lapses could be perilous for Republicans and Democrats alike. If the inquiry focused on why the United States did not take the threat from Osama bin Laden more seriously before Sept. 11, officials from the Bush administration and the Clinton administration could find themselves on the defensive.","163":"When four men go on trial in 12 days in New York on charges they conspired with Osama bin Laden in the deadly bombings of two United States Embassies in East Africa in 1998, one of the government's central witnesses could be a former American Army sergeant who pleaded guilty in October to assisting in the terrorist conspiracy.","1630":"Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, co-equal on America's most-wanted list with Osama bin Laden, is partial to Chevrolet Suburbans with darkened windows. Mr. bin Laden, like many of the sheiks and princes of Saudi Arabia among whom he grew up, likes Toyota Land Cruisers, as did his military commander, Muhammad Atef, a former Egyptian policeman who is believed to have been killed by American bombing last week.","1631":"Just last week, a Predator operated by the Central Intelligence Agency was used to coordinate the surgical strike in which one of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenants was killed, administration officials said.","1632":"The Northern Alliance fighters whom the filmmakers talk to -- including Ahmed Shah Massoud, the legendary Lion of the Panjshir who was assassinated in September by men said to be linked to Osama bin Laden -- are as ruthless and determined as their unseen foes. They see themselves as holy warriors fighting a patriotic battle against an enemy they describe as the tool of Pakistan, Britain and the United States. One imagines that -- at least in terms of the latter two -- their thinking has changed recently.","1633":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22\u2014 The American military continued its systematic hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan by working down a target list of cave networks where Osama bin Laden is suspected to be hiding, officials said today.","1634":"Pakistan had been a close ally of the Taliban until the government's supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, rejected its advice to turn over Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","1635":"FOG OF WAR -- An alliance warlord, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, said he had agreed with a senior Taliban commander on the surrender of thousands of Taliban fighters in Kunduz, starting on Saturday. But later, the alliance's interior minister, Yunus Qanooni, said a military solution was being pursued rather than a negotiated one. Had there been a deal or not? Given rifts in the leadership of the alliance, it was anybody's guess. Taliban negotiators may not have spoken for all the trapped forces. Afghan troops may have been ready to give up, but not the thousands of foreigners -- Pakistanis, Arabs and Chechens devoted to Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda -- who have vowed to fight to the death. That is what Washington wants anyway. As in all wars, guns speak louder than words.","1636":"NEW HAVEN\u2014 If we should capture Osama bin Laden or his accomplices in the days ahead, where should we try them? Two unsound proposals have recently emerged. The first, and by far more dangerous, is already law: the president's misguided and much criticized order authorizing secret trials before an American military commission. The second, more benign approach, offered by prominent international lawyers, is to try terrorists before an as yet uncreated international tribunal.","1637":"In conversations here, many Saudis have in fact pointed instead to the presence of some 5,000 American troops in the kingdom as the main reason for anti-American resentment. That presence, in a kingdom that is home to Islam's two holiest cites, has been cited repeatedly by Osama bin Laden, whose Saudi citizenship was revoked in 1994, and by some militant Saudi clerics as the main justification in their calls for a holy war against the United States and its Saudi allies.","1638":"'I am writing this will while in front of me, four meters away, are Sheik Osama and his first deputy, Sheik Abu Hafas al-Masri, and the second deputy, Sheik Ayman al-Zawahiri,' the author wrote, referring to Osama bin Laden and two of his top lieutenants. 'Thanks to the kindness of God, I am passing my life with these people who are like lions against the infidels.'","1639":"We have also learned how close Taliban leaders were to Osama bin Laden, preaching his hatred and following his orders. Taliban soldiers, including tens of thousands of foreign volunteers, have to be taken seriously as a potential terrorist army.","164":"The United Nations gave the Taliban a month to surrender Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier of militancy who is thought to be in Afghanistan. Mr. bin Laden is wanted in the United States on charges of being behind the bombings of two United States Embassies in Africa in 1998.","1640":"They said the fighters had also established bases at two locations in the vicinity of Jalalabad in northeastern Afghanistan, within 40 miles of the Pakistan border. Rumors are rife in Jalalabad that the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden may be among them, possibly in an area of jagged ridges called Tora Bora.","1642":"More than nine hours westward, the first hijacked plane had struck the World Trade Center, and the second struck shortly after Ms. Chamberlin began watching. That it was terrorism was certain, and that it had momentous implications for the United States' strained relationship with Pakistan seemed just as clear -- at least to American officials like Ms. Chamberlin, 53, whose experience in counterterrorism made Osama bin Laden an immediate suspect.","1643":"The Rev. Jesse Jackson made the list for remarking to an audience at Harvard Law School that America should 'build bridges and relationships, not simply bombs and walls.' Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle Eastern history at Stanford University, earned a place on it for his opinion that 'If Osama bin Laden is confirmed to be behind the attacks, the United States should bring him before an international tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity.' And Wasima Alikhan of the Islamic Academy of Las Vegas was there simply for saying 'Ignorance breeds hate.'","1645":"This kind of high-handedness and secrecy has been a hallmark of the administration beginning Jan. 20, not Sept. 11. The Cheney energy task force faced a lawsuit from the General Accounting Office rather than reveal its dealings with Bush-Cheney campaign contributors like those at the now imploding Enron Corporation. The president's commission on Social Security reform also bent the law to meet in secret. But since the war began, the administration has gone to unprecedented lengths to restrict news coverage of not only its own activities but also Osama bin Laden's. A Bush executive order diminishing access to presidential papers could restrict a future David McCullough or Michael Beschloss from reconstructing presidential histories. To consolidate his own power, Mr. Ashcroft even seized authority from Mary Jo White, the battle-proven U.S. attorney who successfully prosecuted both the 1993 World Trade Center terrorists and the bin Laden accomplices in the 1998 African embassy bombings. He has similarly shunted aside state and local law-enforcement officials by keeping them in the dark before issuing his vague warnings of imminent terrorist attacks.","1646":"DIGGING IN -- If Pakistani intelligence officials are right, non-Afghan fighters for the Taliban were digging in near Kabul, the Afghan capital, and also at two locations outside Jalalabad, in the country's northeast. Rumors spread that Osama bin Laden was with them -- not near Kandahar in the south, as generally assumed, but in an area of jagged ridges called Tora Bora. It was hard to tell what to believe. But about 800 American Special Operations forces were said to be massed in Pakistan, ready to enter Afghanistan to find Mr. bin Laden and kill him.","1647":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 23\u2014 With Taliban troops establishing strong pockets of resistance across a wide swath of Afghanistan, the United States is using two bases in Pakistan to send in several hundred Special Operations forces in an attempt to kill Taliban troops and capture Osama bin Laden.","1648":"'No country in Europe could extradite detainees to the United States if there were any chance they would be put before these military tribunals,' said the prosecutor, who is helping to coordinate the criminal procedures against the eight men, whom prosecutors believe to be associates of Osama bin Laden.","1649":"HOLDING OUT -- With Taliban troops unexpectedly establishing pockets of resistance across a wide swath of Afghanistan, the United States is using two bases in Pakistan to send in several hundred American Special Operations forces in an attempt to kill Taliban troops and capture Osama bin Laden.

No hunt has attracted more media attention and a greater sum than the quest for Osama bin Laden for his role in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The government is offering a reward of up to $25 million for information leading to the capture of Mr. bin Laden and his senior officers.","1654":"But Bradley Ortman, Mr. Refai's lawyer, said that investigators have cleared Mr. Refai of having connections to terrorists. According to newspaper accounts, investigators apparently have decided that the documents from Arkansas involved a case of mistaken identity, the cigarette lighters were just trinkets and Osama bin Laden was not the Osama proposed as his child's namesake. Mr. Refai has told investigators the videos were vacation shots.","1655":"Acting on information from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Yemeni security police have begun to pick up suspects for interrogation in what the interior minister calls an 'ongoing operation.' Although authorities here would not be more specific, they said that at least one known member of Al Qaeda, the terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden, had been among those identified by the C.I.A. and arrested.","1656":"Jonathan Rosen is right. Osama bin Laden would seek to destroy Israel and the United States even if the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza ended tomorrow. But America is not seeking to win over the bin Ladens. The success of our war against terrorism may depend on a coalition that includes millions of Muslims, who do indeed care about the West Bank and Gaza.","1657":"At San Diego State University, an Ethiopian-born student fluent in Arabic, Zewdalem Kebede, received a disciplinary warning for criticizing three students he said he overheard in the university library praising Osama bin Laden in Arabic for the Sept. 11 attacks.","1658":"One of the most chilling of the wave of books that speak to the Sept. 11 attacks is a careful and exhaustive study of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. 'Study of Revenge,' which was published last year but has been reissued, with a new introduction by the former director of central intelligence R. James Woolsey, makes a powerful case for Iraqi involvement in the first World Trade Center attack. Laurie Mylroie has combed through the court documents of the case and pieced together a series of connections with Iraq that prosecutors, concerned only with indicting those on trial, ignored. Unfortunately, it was not just the prosecutors who failed to heed the warning signs. Mylroie's research challenges the widespread belief that rogue networks of terrorists run by Islamic radicals like Osama bin Laden work without state sponsorship. Saddam Hussein, she argues, driven by a desire for revenge following the gulf war, is the single greatest terrorist threat to the United States. The decision by the Clinton administration to duck the question of Iraqi involvement in the 1993 bombing may well, according to Mylroie, have led to a series of later terrorist strikes, including the 1998 bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500. If she is correct, the Sept. 11 attacks, along with other incidents like the 1996 bombing of the Al Khobar base in Saudi Arabia that left 19 American servicemen dead, were the inevitable consequence of an administration and an intelligence service that has spent the last decade asleep at the wheel. Chris Hedges","1659":"They are all children of parents born in the Middle East who have become American citizens. All three said they had been approached since the attacks by fellow classmates and officers with wide-ranging questions. Some asked about Koran passages; others wondered if Osama bin Laden was really from a wealthy family. One cadet asked Cadet Bagherpour if the Koran condemns suicide.","166":"But what has drawn attention to Al-Ribat is not Muhammad bin Laden, who died in the 1960's, so much as Osama, the 17th of his 51 children. Osama bin Laden, in recent years, has been America's most wanted terrorism suspect, with a $5 million reward on his head for his alleged role in the August 1998 truck bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people, as well as a string of other terrorist attacks.","1660":"11 1 HOLY WAR, INC., by Peter L.

Surveys by the Drug Enforcement Administration showed that most of the heroin in American drug markets came from Colombia and Mexico. The State Department was wary about working with the Taliban on any issue, given its poor human rights record and its hospitality toward Osama bin Laden. So too were officials in northern Europe, even though their cities were awash in Afghan heroin.","1663":"WITH the Taliban badly battered in Afghanistan, and Osama bin Laden on the run, the biggest parlor game in Washington has now boiled down to one question: What will Phase II of the war look like?","1664":"Abu Sayyaf is fighting for a separate Islamic state in the south of the Philippines.

He is still on the loose. But he was reportedly seen this week at a well-fortified encampment near Tora Bora, deep in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. An Afghan official in that region, Hazarat Ali, said his sources tell him that Mr. bin Laden sleeps in caves and moves at night on horseback. How reliable are these sources? 'I trust them like my mother or father,' Mr. Ali said.","1669":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Nov. 24\u2014 Osama bin Laden was seen this week at a large and well-fortified encampment 35 miles southwest of this city, a minister of the self-proclaimed government here said tonight.","167":"An article and a map yesterday referred inconsistently to the Yemeni ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, the man wanted by the F.B.I. on suspicion of organizing terror attacks against American targets.

The country's varied landscape and geology make it ideal for caves.","1673":"One reason is that America's mission in Afghanistan is far from accomplished. Osama bin Laden and many top aides remain at large, Taliban fighters still hold out in the countryside and a few urban redoubts, and the creation of a stable post-Taliban government has barely begun. Until these basic objectives are achieved, Afghanistan will remain a potential base for international terrorism.","1674":"Tom Whalen, another police officer who signed the flag, said in an interview that he wanted to send a message to Osama bin Laden.

Outside that city, hundreds of marines poured in, the front edge of a 1,000-man force said likely to join the hunt for Osama bin Laden and then go after remaining Taliban troops. The marines' arrival fills a need for fighters who can conduct sustained assaults -- who, in the words of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, can 'crawl around on the ground and find people.'","1676":"While the Taliban home base of Kandahar and the hunt for Osama bin Laden will continue to be the focus of American attention, a vast majority of Afghans will be watching negotiations that start in Germany on Tuesday and that could determine whether their country reverts to civil war or unites in a new era of stability.","1677":"The marines were to be the front edge of a powerful force of more than 1,000 combat troops who, the officials said, are likely to join the hunt for Osama bin Laden within days and then begin raids against Taliban forces concentrated in Kandahar and in mountain redoubts near the border with Pakistan.","1678":"THE CAVES -- If Osama bin Laden is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, as American officials suspect, he has plenty to choose from.

Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, was believed to be rallying his troops for a last stand. Osama bin Laden, on the other hand, 'seems to be concentrating on hiding,' General Myers said.","1689":"The primary remaining military objectives are to uproot the Taliban from Kandahar, their original stronghold and last center of power, and to hunt down Osama bin Laden and his fellow terrorists. Both goals must be achieved in the ethnic Pashtun regions of southern and eastern Afghanistan where the Northern Alliance, made up largely of non-Pashtun minority groups, cannot be as useful a military partner as it was in the north. The brunt of the fighting in this phase of the war is likely to be borne by the marines. President Bush warned Americans yesterday to 'be prepared for loss of life.' To minimize casualties, the Pentagon must be as smart and creative in developing battlefield tactics as it has been in other areas of Afghanistan.","169":"The defendants, who have pleaded not guilty, are charged with taking part in a global terrorist conspiracy against Americans, which included the bombings and other acts of terror and was led, the authorities say, by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","1690":"About 500 marines dug in today at a primitive desert airstrip less than 80 miles southwest of Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold, but still within easy helicopter striking distance of the city.

The two men, Ali Alfatimi and Basam Nahshal, are still being detained.","1697":"SEEKING BIN LADEN -- As ever, the big prize for the United States is finding Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda disciples. Offering their most explicit details to date, senior Pentagon officials said the hunt was focused on the region around Kandahar, in the Afghan south, and along a mountainous, cave-dotted stretch in the east, between Kabul and the Khyber Pass. To make the point more forcefully, American warplanes bombed a compound southeast of Kandahar said to have been used by the Taliban, Al Qaeda and others. No doubt, people were killed, officials in Washington said. The tantalizing question was who. Too early to tell, the officials said.","1698":"Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has indicated that it was unlikely that the United States would be part of a formal peacemaking or peacekeeping force after Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his terrorist organization, were defeated.","1699":"But Prince Walid's remarks were extraordinarily bold by the standards of Saudi Arabia, where criticism of the royal family is prohibited -- and where some officials have continued to dismiss as unproven the idea of Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, for which the United States holds the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden responsible.","17":"The focus of inquiry into the group of Montreal-based men accused of plotting a terrorist attack in America has shifted from Algeria to Afghanistan. Though several of the Algerians accused in the plot were once members of an Algerian militant group that had never before targeted Americans, investigators have come to believe that the head of the alleged terrorist cell was a Mauritanian with ties not to Algeria, but to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi charged in the 1998 bombing of two American embassies in Africa. At Washington's request, Senegal arrested the Mauritanian, Mohambedou Ould Slahi, the alleged head of the Montreal Algerian cell. The Justice Department sought his extradition to America. JUDITH MILLER","170":"President Ali Abdullah Saleh said last month that the authorities were still looking for a key suspect and that it was possible that Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier, was involved.","1700":"Attorney General John Ashcroft said this week that the F.B.I. issued a warning to its field offices that terrorists might attack natural gas supplies if Osama bin Laden were killed or captured in Afghanistan.","1701":"The house, like others in the Afghan capital apparently used by Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda, seems to have been hastily abandoned when the Taliban fled Kabul two weeks ago. It is not clear who may have been in the house since then, or whether the littered papers and rough sketches may have been left by someone else.","1702":"Officials said they did not know whether Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban, or Osama bin Laden was present at the compound when it was struck.","1703":"The measure sailed through the House 408 to 6 after reports linked Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, to the African diamond trade, which is also thought to a major cause of civil wars in sub-Saharan Africa.","1704":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Nov. 28\u2014 American forces have enlisted commanders in eastern Afghanistan to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hide-outs south of this city, a senior minister of the regional government said today.","1705":"LONDON, Nov. 28\u2014 A High Court judge ruled today that a man identified in court testimony in the United States as a terrorist and ally of Osama bin Laden is entitled to the 'bare necessities' of life. The ruling potentially undermined the British government's effort to snare the suspect in a financial stranglehold.","1706":"Many C.I.A. officers in the field are paramilitary operatives from the agency's Special Activities Division inside the Directorate of Operations. Others are from the agency's Counterterrorism Center, which has led the C.I.A.'s investigation of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","1707":"German officials have said recently that at least 10 people, mainly students and businessmen of Arab background, are under investigation for suspected contacts with the Hamburg hijackers cell. But investigators have been hampered by German laws that prevent authorities from making arrests without serious suspicion of illegal activity. Thus, while a wave of arrests of Arab men suspected of ties to the Qaeda network of Osama bin Laden has swept a number of European countries since Sept. 11, this was the first arrest in Germany.","1708":"Despite reports that the Taliban prisoners who staged the uprising had not been adequately searched for weapons, Mr. Spann placed blame for his son's death on only one person: Osama bin Laden.","1709":"SEARCHING FOR BIN LADEN -- American forces have enlisted commanders in eastern Afghanistan to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hideouts. B2","171":"Officials in Washington say that American intelligence recently was told of a threat made by Islamic terrorists against the interests of the United States and at least one other country represented in Rome. Other officials said the threat came from people associated with Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda.","1710":"'My actions appeared justified,' the general told the court, adding that he would do the same again today 'if it were against Osama bin Laden.'","1711":"At the same time, anti-Taliban commanders in eastern Afghanistan said that they had been enlisted by the American military to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hide-outs. [Page B2.]","1712":"One faction belongs to Yunis Khalis, who helped expel the Soviets in 1989 and welcomed Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan five years ago. He has one foot in the camp of the new government in these parts, and one still planted with the Taliban.","1713":"In his testimony, Mr. Chertoff introduced a new explanation for the department's detention of about 600 men, on criminal and immigration charges. He said it was intended, in part, to catch and disable what he called 'sleeper' agents Osama bin Laden might have sent to the United States.","1714":"Court TV's big story this week followed the closing arguments in the case of Richard Sharpe, described as the 'cross-dressing dermatologist' from Massachusetts. He said he was insane when he killed his wife. But tonight at 10 on its regular series 'The System,' Court TV plugs into larger events with 'Osama bin Laden on Trial,' a contemplation of how 'the world's most wanted' might be prosecuted and defended in an American courtroom.","1715":"ADDING PRESSURE -- The goal, of course, is to deliver a final blow to Osama bin Laden and the remnants of his Taliban shield, believed to have taken refuge near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and across a stretch of terrain east and south of Kabul, the capital. 'We're going to continue to apply pressure,' General Franks said.","1716":"The order is described as if it is aimed only at Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders. A former deputy attorney general, George J. Terwilliger III, said the masterminds of the Sept. 11 attacks 'don't deserve constitutional protection.'","1717":"Abdullah Omar Abdel Rahman said that his brothers never belonged to the Qaeda network, and that he had never heard from them that they had any relationship with its leader, Osama bin Laden. He said Ahmed made his living in Afghanistan by selling used cars, while Muhammad worked as a trader.","1718":"Although he has never advocated the killing of prisoners, comments like one he made about taking Osama bin Laden dead or alive -- 'I have my preference,' Mr. Rumsfeld said -- have been criticized for the signal they might send to Afghan warlords.","1719":"A federal judge in Brooklyn yesterday dismissed charges against two men accused of smuggling more than $140,000 in cash to Yemen, most of it hidden in a shipment of honey. The charges were dismissed without prejudice, allowing prosecutors to reinstate the charges within five years. Federal authorities had identified several honey businesses in Yemen that they said were linked to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda. Prosecutors sought the dismissal of the charges, which were brought last month. The men, Ali Al-Fatimi and Basam Nashal, had been held without bail. Yesterday, Mr. Al-Fatimi was released. Mr Nashal, 22, who had been on probation in an unrelated state case, was being held for a court appearance in that case today. Prosecutors would not say why they had asked that the charges be dismissed. Mr. Nashal's lawyer, Trevor L. Headley, said his client did not know there was money in the boxes of honey. Mr. Al-Fatimi's lawyer could not be reached for comment.","172":"Italian newspapers and television reported that the United States had reports that a three-person team of Algerian terrorists with links to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile believed to be responsible for financing a network of Islamic terrorists, was planning a suicide bomb attack on the embassy. Italian security officials did not confirm those reports.","1720":"Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chief deputy Republican whip in the House, announced the proposal yesterday at a news conference attended by several relatives of those who died on Aug. 7, 1998, in the coordinated attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which have been attributed to associates of Osama bin Laden. Twelve Americans died in the attacks.","1721":"MILAN, Nov. 29\u2014 The Italian police raided two mosques here early today and arrested two men accused of recruiting fighters for Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. A warrant was issued for a third man who is believed to be in Afghanistan, and the police disclosed that a fourth man has been in detention for two weeks.","1722":"If the military tribunals do come to pass, administration officials have an idea of whom they would like to see in the dock -- besides Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants, of course. A good example, some at the White House said, is one Ahmed Abdel Rahman, who was credibly reported to have been captured by Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. He is hardly the grand prize, American military officials said, but a good catch all the same.","1723":"At the White House, Mr. Fleischer likened the program that would give special immigration status to foreigners who provide information about terrorism to federal offers of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of a wanted suspect. (There is a $25 million reward for information leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden.) But in this case, in lieu of cash, the government is offering the right to stay in the United States and perhaps the prospect of obtaining a green card.","1724":"'Patrick Cuffy realized that three things could get him his freedom,' said Dwight L. Thomas, another lawyer for Mr. Dorsey. He could reveal the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden or Eric Robert Rudolph, charged in the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Or, 'third, to say that Sidney Dorsey told him to do this. He chose the latter.'","1725":"Since the United States began its offensive against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, Uzbekistan, which borders Afghanistan, has become a new strategic ally of the United States.","1726":"Mr. Namangani, an exile from Uzbekistan who is thought to have been killed near here, was a co-founder of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which helped destabilize three nations and whose guerrilla successes won him the attention and support of Osama bin Laden. Last month President Bush put the movement on a list of terrorist organizations whose assets would be frozen.","1727":"He laughed uproariously and said: 'You've got to be kidding. I'm proud of it.' Later, he was asked his opinion of the rumor that Osama bin Laden had made the short list for Time magazine's man of the year award. 'There is only one list that Osama bin Laden should be on,' he said, to laughter. Everyone got what he meant. But it can't be printed here.","1728":"Other senior officials in Washington have suggested that the marines could launch lightning raids, but said they were not likely to mount cave-to-cave searches for Osama bin Laden or his lieutenants.","1729":"VILLAGES ARE HIT -- On things perhaps going wrong, there was an American air raid over Tora Bora, the cave complex in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden may be hiding. Although military officials vigorously denied missing their target, residents of nearby villages said that bombs fell on them, killing scores of civilians -- at least 70 some said, and maybe many more.","173":"ADEN, Yemen, Jan. 8\u2014 A prime suspect in the attack on the American warship Cole told the authorities in his confession that he believed that the two suicide bombers had acted on the orders of Osama bin Laden, Yemeni officials close to the investigation said today.","1731":"BEIRUT, Lebanon\u2014 So what comes after the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are finished? Probably more Talibans and new Osama bin Ladens. This is the sad and shocking reality that we must confront. It will happen apart from all the fanfare surrounding America's military triumph in Afghanistan and all the other achievements of this so-called war on terror. Why? Because the Taliban and Mr. bin Laden are not isolated cases but manifestations of a complex, and potentially durable, sociopolitical phenomenon.","1732":"Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the lead prosecutor in the investigation of Osama bin Laden and now the United States attorney in Chicago, is only slightly more effusive, saying having Mr. Comey follow Ms. White 'is the greatest succession in New York since Mickey Mantle took over center field from Joe DiMaggio.'","1733":"7 11 2 HOLY WAR, INC., by Peter L. Bergen. (Free Press, $26.) A television journalist's account of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.","1734":"In his administration, the internationalist camp believes that, as in the Persian Gulf War a decade ago, the American military mandate in the terror war is narrowly defined, at least initially. A decade ago the mandate was to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and today it is to destroy Osama bin Laden's main base in Afghanistan, and with it the Taliban. The way forward in confronting terrorism's broader threat, for these people, is to focus on collective action and international consensus while mediating conflicts that feed into terrorism.","1735":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 1\u2014 Witnesses and local officials said today that American bombers flying over Tora Bora, the cave complex where Osama bin Laden may be hiding, struck three nearby villages, killing dozens of civilians. But a high-ranking Pentagon official said the bombers had attacked sites 20 miles away and had only hit their targets.","1736":"ERRANT BOMBING REPORTED -- American bombers over Tora Bora, the cave complex where Osama bin Laden may be hiding, struck three Afghan villages, killing or injuring scores of civilians, witnesses and local officials said. But an American spokesman, Marine Maj. Brad Lowell, denied that American bombs had mistakenly hit a village, saying that the target struck was military. B2","1737":"What happens when you cut off the head of a terrorist organization? If Osama bin Laden, who has been Al Qaeda's founder, theoretician, financier and spokesman, is killed or captured, will it sprout new heads like the beast that fought on till Hercules cauterized every neck? Will it, as any biology student has watched, go still for a while as it grows a new head? Or are its cells so self-directed and self-supporting that it can continue waging jihad even if every leader in Afghanistan is killed or run to ground?","1738":"Since Sept. 11, Muslim leaders have repeatedly said that extremists like Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network have distorted religious teachings to justify terrorism. But beyond these now-familiar declarations that the attacks against the United States were 'not Islam,' there has been mostly silence.","1739":"One of the most troubling moves by the administration has been the secret and in some cases prolonged detention of suspects rounded up after Sept. 11. The Justice Department, which has offered a shifting series of explanations as to why this is necessary, most recently suggested that it was responding to the possibility that Osama bin Laden might have sent 'sleeper' agents to the United States. The American system does not hold with the idea of incarcerating a large group of people who it seems to have no credible reason to believe are dangerous, out of vague concern that somewhere among them might be a future law-breaker.","174":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Jan. 10\u2014 Osama bin Laden, wanted by the United States on terrorism charges, appeared happy and smiling at his son's wedding in Afghanistan in a videotape shown today on an Arab satellite channel.","1740":"Few at the prayer session did stop to talk but they mentioned over and over how hurt they were that the police had failed to take their shoes off inside the center during the raid. They said they were sure the accusations of terrorist links were bogus, as were those against Osama bin Laden.","1741":"Today, Mr. Nasir lies on the floor of an abandoned home, wrapped in a dirty blanket, with an infection gnawing his limb and Northern Alliance guards debating his future. He has come a long way from his working-class home in Riyadh, and the pep talk from Osama bin Laden a few months before offers little succor now.","1744":"Ariel Sharon, the Israeli leader, has compared Mr. Arafat to Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. And, like Mr. Arafat, Mr. Sharon has little political room to make concessions for peace if he is inclined to. Israeli commentators are already mocking him for a blithe boast he made before he departed last week on a trip to the United States. He said that he could now devote most of his time to the imploding economy, because 'it appears to me that we have found the way, which won't be short and won't be easy, to stand up to and struggle against terror.' Then came the worst terror attacks in months.","1745":"CAIRO, Dec. 2\u2014 Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden and a man with a price on his head, says in excerpts from his autobiography published today that the Arabs fighting in Afghanistan, no matter what their fate, succeeded in galvanizing Muslim youth around the world in taking on the West.","1746":"If you don't want to drag Osama bin Laden to the U.S. for a circus of a trial, fine. Shoot him in his cave. Bomb him. Whatever. He's a war criminal on the loose and a genuine threat to kill thousands more at any time.","1747":"BIN LADEN AIDE -- Ayman Al-Zawahiri, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, says in his autobiography that the Arabs fighting in Afghanistan, no matter what their fate, succeeded in galvanizing Muslim youth around the world in taking on the West.

Qaeda cells are scattered around the globe, some in areas of the world ungoverned by any central authority: on Somali territory in Ras Kamboni, at the Kenya border; in Yemen's Hadhramaut province; and in parts of Indonesia and the southern Philippines.","175":"Court filings in the prosecution of four men linked to Osama bin Laden and charged in the bombings of American embassies in Africa in 1998 show that United States monitoring of terror group communications had yielded enough evidence three months before the deadly blasts to indict Mr. bin Laden in the killings of American forces in Somalia in 1993. But the interceptions could not prevent the embassy attacks. Mr. Bin Laden is thought to be in Afghanistan. Jury selection continued in Manhattan.

By contrast, he said, the work and the spirit of the honorees will endure. 'You are,' he told them, 'the symbol of what is good and decent and uplifting in the world.'","1751":"Muhammad Tahir is from the village of Gudara, population perhaps 4,000. Like hundreds of Afghan villages, it is not on most maps. But it lies about three miles from a now famous mountain redoubt called Tora Bora, where the United States thinks Osama bin Laden may be hiding. The elders of Gudara have gone to Jalalabad, the provincial capital, to state their case.","1752":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 2\u2014 According to Afghan commanders here in the far eastern part of the country, civilians are being killed in the American hunt for Osama bin Laden.","1753":"Osama bin Laden, according to Fox News Channel anchors, analysts and correspondents, is 'a dirtbag,' 'a monster' overseeing a 'web of hate.' His followers in Al Qaeda are 'terror goons.' Taliban fighters are 'diabolical' and 'henchmen.'","1754":"Although the Pentagon hopes that Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants will be captured or killed by opposition forces or by others motivated by a $25 million reward, or will succumb to the American bombing campaign, Mr. Rumsfeld did not rule out that extreme measures may be used to remove Taliban and Al Qaeda members from fortified caves.","1755":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 3\u2014 For weeks now, Saudi Arabia has been on the defensive, tarred in the Western press as complicit in terrorism, portrayed as the proselytizer of Islam's least tolerant version, denounced for giving rise not just to Osama bin Laden but also to 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11.","1756":"Mr. Nana added that he was not surprised to learn that his friend supported the Taliban. Mr. Walker told CNN over the weekend that he had joined the Taliban as a volunteer because his 'heart became attached to them' after he studied their movement. He also claimed to have gone to a training camp in Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden appeared several times.","1757":"His premonition proved correct on Nov. 13, when as part of an antiterrorism dragnet, the police arrested Mr. Mardini and the buyer. Mr. Mardini has since cleared himself and been freed, but a Spanish judge has accused the man who bought his business of belonging to a sleeper cell loyal to Osama bin Laden.","1758":"ROME, Dec. 3\u2014 The Italian police searched a dozen companies in Northern Italy today, looking for evidence that they might be financing Osama bin Laden's terror network, Al Qaeda.","1759":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 3\u2014 An Afghan commander said tonight that 1,500 Pashtun fighters, accompanied by American Special Operations soldiers, were prepared to attack Tora Bora, the mountain cave complex where Osama bin Laden and 2,000 Al Qaeda fighters are believed to be hiding.","176":"By the late spring of 1996, American intelligence learned that a group of Muslim extremists bent on Holy War against the United States had established a base in Nairobi, Kenya, the government says.

Early last month, the administration broadened the campaign to seize terrorists' assets beyond groups with links to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda by imposing stringent financial sanctions on Hamas, Hezbollah and 20 other groups. But few if any of those groups had assets in the United States.","1765":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 3\u2014 For weeks now, Saudi Arabia has been on the defensive, tarred in the Western press as complicit in terrorism, portrayed as the proselytizer of Islam's least tolerant version, denounced for giving rise not just to Osama bin Laden but also to 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11.","1766":"RISHKHOR, Afghanistan, Dec. 3\u2014 The crude metal noose said to have killed the mujahedeen commander Abdul Haq still hangs from a maple tree here, half a mile from one of Osama bin Laden's largest terrorist training camps.","1767":"United States marines, joined by commandos from Australia and Britain, began fitting a noose around the Taliban's stronghold of Kandahar, while American warplanes hammered the caves and tunnels of eastern Afghanistan, trying to shake loose Osama bin Laden -- in the event he is there.","1768":"If Saudi officials know how many Saudis have been fighting in Afghanistan alongside Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, they will not say.","1769":"It ended with last weekend's spasm of suicide bombings against Israeli kids -- a signal that the Palestinian national movement was being taken over by bin Ladenism, which is the nihilistic pursuit of murderous violence against civilians, without any political program and outside of any political context. If there is anything left of the Palestinian national movement for independence, it better act now to rescue itself. Otherwise it's headed for the same dark cave as Osama bin Laden.","177":"In 1987, several years after he began training Arab volunteers to oust Soviet forces from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had a vision. The time had come, he told friends, to start a global jihad, or Islamic holy war, against the corrupt secular governments of the Muslim Middle East and the Western powers that supported them.","1770":"In a Pentagon briefing today Gen. Richard B. Myers of the Air Force, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that he was aware of reports that Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top deputy to Osama bin Laden, had been wounded in an airstrike but that he could not confirm the reports. There were other unconfirmed reports of Al Qaeda figures being killed.","1771":"France is already drafting the needed Security Council resolution and Britain is prepared to organize and serve as the core of the force, which would also include willing Muslims like the Turks, diplomats said. They said Washington supported the idea of such a force around Kabul since the Afghans wanted one, but would not want it extended to areas where it could get in the way of the war against Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","1772":"If Osama bin Laden promised to turn over a new leaf and disband Al Qaeda, would the United States give him a 'last chance'?","1773":"Along with the Harkat ul-Mujahedeen literature were more than a dozen small green artillery instruction booklets with 'Al Qaeda' printed on their front cover.

Mr. Walker surrendered late last month with about 400 Taliban fighters in Kunduz, and was taken to Qala Jangi, a mud-walled fort converted into a prison. After the uprising was put down, Mr. Walker was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Sheberghan, where he was treated for wounds suffered in the fighting.","1776":"QUETTA, Pakistan, Dec. 5\u2014 The man appointed today to lead Afghanistan's new interim government, Hamid Karzai, said tonight that he had begun talks with senior Taliban officials over the surrender of Kandahar, the last major stronghold of the Taliban and Arab fighters loyal to Osama bin Laden.","1777":"Mr. Ashcroft has refused to list the names, citing several reasons, including saying it would help Osama bin Laden learn whether his operatives had been detained.","1778":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 5\u2014 A front-line anti-Taliban commander said today that Osama bin Laden's top aide, Ayman al-Zawahiri, had been killed during fierce fighting here.","1779":"American warplanes continued to attack concentrations of Taliban forces near Kandahar and the cave-pocked mountains along the Pakistan border south and west of Jalalabad, including a heavily fortified encampment known as Tora Bora.

We are, after all, at war.","1782":"ATTACKING AL QAEDA -- With American military advisers working behind the scenes, a group of anti-Taliban Afghan fighters squared off for the first time against Osama bin Laden's Qaeda forces at their mountain redoubt in eastern Afghanistan.","1783":"But tonight negotiators had yet to resolve two critical issues that could affect the surrender: the fate of Mullah Muhammad Omar and of thousands of Arab fighters, who are loyal to Osama bin Laden and believed to be in Kandahar.","1784":"'In the last few days, in particular, we have emphasized, underscored and repeated our very clear position on the required disposition of Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden,' said one senior official.","1786":"BEIJING, Dec. 6\u2014 A top American antiterrorism official wound up two days of talks here today by praising the Chinese for their cooperation in fighting Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, and said he was hopeful that the F.B.I. would soon be allowed to open a liaison office in Beijing.","1787":"The suspect, Hassan Said Awadh Khemeri, a Yemeni who had trained at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, was one of several suspects in the Cole attack who had been arrested in prior cases but released, according to interviews with officials in Yemen and the United States.","1788":"COLE ATTACK -- A Yemeni official charges that evidence linking Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to the bombing of the destroyer Cole -- including a letter believed to have been written by Mr. bin Laden and found in the house of one of the suspected plotters -- has not been turned over to the F.B.I.

He had been expelled from the Sudan, stripped of his citizenship by Saudi Arabia. Afghanistan was probably the only country in the world where he could find refuge and allegiance.","1793":"Another issue that has arisen with the surrender of Kandahar is the fate of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban. Though Mr. Haass was unequivocal about the intention of bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, he left open the possibility that the interim administration, led by a southern Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, would be allowed to try Mullah Omar.","1794":"Mr. Bush mentioned neither Mr. Omar nor Osama bin Laden by name, but left no doubt that his language of war was directed at them. The terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, he said, 'celebrate death, making a mission of murder and a sacrament of suicide.' And yet, he added, 'for some reason, only young followers are ushered down this deadly path to paradise, while terrorist leaders run into caves to save their own hides.'","1796":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 7\u2014 Anti-Taliban Afghan fighters appeared stalled today in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by Osama bin Laden loyalists and then begin a full-scale search for him there.","1797":"PARIS, Dec. 7\u2014 Investigators piecing together the suicide-bomb assassination of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Afghan rebel leader, say they believe the plot was carried out by members of a European-based cell of Al Qaeda that on remote-control command from Osama bin Laden reached back to Afghanistan to destroy its prey.","1798":"CAVE WARFARE -- Anti-Taliban Afghan fighters appeared stalled in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by Osama bin Laden loyalists and to begin a full-scale search for him there. B2","1799":"In the east, attacks by opposition forces stalled in the mountains around Tora Bora, where 2,000 Al Qaeda fighters and the other fugitive, Osama bin Laden, were believed to be holed up. Spurred perhaps by the $25 million reward on Mr. bin Laden's head, there were reports that he had been seen on a horse and that his headquarters had been found, but neither seemed to be true.","18":"AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 2\u2014 Jordanian security agents said this week that 13 men imprisoned here on charges of plotting terrorist attacks in Jordan were trained in Afghan camps operated by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi fugitive.","180":"Jordanian and American officials say a thwarted terrorist attack in Jordan in late 1999 is a case study of how Osama bin Laden and his deputies, isolated in Afghanistan, have extended their reach. A1","1800":"Another issue that has arisen with the surrender of Kandahar is the fate of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban. Though Mr. Haass was unequivocal about the intention of bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, he left open the possibility that the interim administration, led by a southern Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, would be allowed to try Mullah Omar.","1801":"CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 7\u2014 It was not supposed to be about an American military campaign in Afghanistan and the fate of Osama bin Laden. It was not supposed to be about Israeli airstrikes in the West Bank and a new standoff between Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat.","1802":"General Gul remains a supporter of the Taliban and he denounced the Americans for condemning them and Osama bin Laden without providing any proof of guilt.","1803":"Imposing challenges lie ahead, like finding Osama bin Laden and top Taliban leaders like Mullah Muhammmad Omar, securing the power of the new coalition government and feeding millions of refugees displaced by years of conflict. Americans must understand that despite the Taliban's rapid collapse, Washington's military and humanitarian responsibilities in Afghanistan are far from over.","1804":"The Soviet occupation began attracting mujahedeen fighters from the Islamic world, including Osama bin Laden. In 1984, they began receiving broad assistance, in weapons and training, from the United States.","1805":"Since then, President Bush has challenged Chechen rebels to sever all ties with Osama bin Laden and terrorism. The United States now not only agrees that the war in Chechnya has a terrorist element, but has moved on its own to choke off funds that fuel the conflict, a senior American diplomat said recently.","1806":"'There is a villain in the story who betrays Charlemagne and causes the death of innocent women and children,' Mr. Cuticchio said recently in Italian in his workshop here. 'And everyone who sees the puppet plays will understand that this villain named Gano di Magonza is the puppet incarnation of Osama bin Laden.'","1807":"SHIFT IN FOCUS -- The focus of the war shifted from fallen Kandahar to the eastern mountains around Tora Bora, where Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda fighters were believed to be dug in. A day after Taliban forces abandoned their last stronghold at Kandahar, pockets of resistance led to isolated skirmishes near the city. While fighting among victorious factions inside Kandahar quieted down, rivals claimed control of key parts of the city and tensions were running high.","1808":"The whereabouts of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, and his patron, Osama bin Laden, were still a mystery. Despite unconfirmed reports that Mullah Omar had been seized by a warlord in Kandahar, the Northern Alliance foreign minister, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, said Mullah Omar was still missing.","1809":"11 7 3 HOLY WAR, INC., by Peter L. Bergen. (Free Press, $26.) A television journalist's account of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.","181":"After weeks of advanced training in explosives at one of Osama bin Laden's Afghan camps, Raed Hijazi, a onetime Boston cab driver, was ready for his mission. The chemicals for the explosives were stockpiled. The targets were selected, the homemade detonators wired.","1812":"Yet blaming ourselves for na\u00efvet\u00e9 misses an essential point. Part of what makes a civilization civilized is a natural reluctance to believe unconscionable evil until it is realized in front of us. This is not a failing. It is an achievement. Part of the essence of civilization is the slow accretion of social and civic trust that enables us to live together in highly complex and interdependent ways. That achievement was severely dented on Sept. 11, and our civilization is less civilized as a result. But it is also more mobilized, more conscious and therefore more alive. If our response to Sept. 11 shows anything -- the heroism of the rescue workers, the patriotism of millions, the prosecution of a tenacious and unrelenting war on terrorism -- it is that civilization, though wounded, is far from over. In fact, the one incontrovertible fact of post-Sept. 11 America is that civilization can clearly, ruthlessly defend itself. Call that the reverse idea of the World Trade Center massacre: the idea that, when mortally threatened, freedom can fight back. And that's an idea that will last much longer than the dark 'brilliance' of Osama bin Laden.","1813":"Must a state extradite war-crimes suspects who seek refuge on their own soil? Yes, says the Princeton group -- unless the prosecuting state employs the death penalty, torture or cruel and degrading punishment. Osama bin Laden, if indicted for crimes against humanity, could be prosecuted anywhere in the world -- but if the prosecuting state employed the death penalty, no country would be obligated to extradite him there. American courts automatically have jurisdiction over terrorists acts committed on United States soil. But if a third country proposed, as the Bush administration has, to try bin Laden before a military tribunal, states could refuse to extradite him there too.","1814":"European nations have been pressing for such a force. The American position is that we must first finish the war against Osama bin Laden, but now that this military objective is close to being achieved, the Bush administration still shows little sense of urgency about protecting Afghan civilians. It does not want more than a limited international peacekeeping force for Afghanistan and appears hesitant to become directly involved in any broader nation building. Administration officials talk about handing over security to an all-Afghan force, but such a force cannot be assembled in time to ensure the delivery of aid before the current winter season takes what could be an enormous toll.","1815":"Although poverty, injustice and servitude may similarly compel the disenfranchised to an interest in Osama bin Laden or Che Guevara, the comparison of bin Laden to Guevara more usefully shows the difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist. Guevara never targeted civilians, and he did not divide the world between good and evil, infidels and the chosen. Osama is feared. Che was, and still is, loved by millions.","1816":"CAIRO\u2014 CONFLICTING reports last week suggested that Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants, might have died or lost his wife and several children when American bombs struck Taliban bases in the Afghan mountains. Whatever his fate, Dr. Zawahiri, a 50-year-old Egyptian surgeon, is viewed as the man who convinced Mr. bin Laden to undertake a kind of death match against Western civilization by transforming his worldwide movement of Islamic militants into an instrument of mass murder.","1817":"They include more than the hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda collaborators and the thousands of Arab and other foreign fighters he drew to Afghanistan.","1818":"But the Bantu say they are not true Somalis and should not be penalized for the actions of Somalis who may be sympathizers of Osama bin Laden.","1819":"Even anti-American fervor has waned. While some Pakistani youths demonstrated in support of Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, upper middle class Iranian youths held a candlelight vigil to condemn the attacks and mourn the dead.","182":"Afghanistan is an inspiration, an essential base of operations, a reservoir of potential suicide bombers and a battle front where crucial ties are forged. It is also, American officials say, where Osama bin Laden is experimenting with chemical weapons.","1821":"The Afghan authority decided upon in Bonn is hardly perfect, as even the United Nations negotiators acknowledged, and it may fracture or be unable to assert its authority outside Kabul. But the conference produced a success, the first peacefully negotiated, internationally supported government for Afghanistan in more than 20 years -- made possible by the American-led war against Osama bin Laden and his own hosts, the Taliban.","1822":"AFGHANISTAN -- By week's end, some of the United States' military campaign's goals were either met or tantalizingly close. After a chaotic push, opposition forces strongly backed by American and allied troops took Kandahar, the Taliban's last stronghold, and were -- at least according to some reports -- close to control of Tora Bora, the northeastern mountain cave complex believed to be the last Afghan redoubt of Osama bin Laden. In Bonn, Afghan factions agreed on a provisional post-Taliban government led by Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun leader, that would be installed Dec. 22 and operate for at least six months.","1823":"Scattered among those ridges are 30 or 40 fortified caves that are the last bastion of Osama bin Laden's hard-core supporters -- and perhaps the hide-out of the terrorist mastermind himself -- the final focus of America's war in Afghanistan.","1824":"American B-52's intensified their bombardment of a complex of caves in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden was believed to be hiding, and American marines in the south and the army of neighboring Pakistan tightened the dragnet on the ground. Nonetheless, there was no sign of either the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, or of Mr. bin Laden himself.","1825":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 9\u2014 A tape of Osama bin Laden found recently in Afghanistan shows him recounting how he listened to news reports on the radio of the first plane crashing into the World Trade Center three months ago and quickly told others around him 'there will be more' as he awaited the second attack.","1826":"DURRAT AL-AROOS, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 8\u2014 Saudi Arabia's top security official said this weekend that he believed that militants other than Osama bin Laden stood at the helm of Al Qaeda, and he warned that the arrest or killing of Mr. bin Laden would not cripple the terrorist organization.","1827":"In Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden is narrowing. But on the war's financial front, the government is only now beginning to come to grips with Al Qaeda's money-raising apparatus, which officials say is so far-flung and diversified that it could survive even if Mr. bin Laden is captured or killed.","1828":"As American bombers continue to pound the area in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden is believed to be holding out, new and chilling evidence has surfaced that United States officials say confirms his links to the attacks against the United States on Sept. 11.","1829":"Mr. Russert questioned Mrs. Clinton on a range of topics, including military tribunals, bioterrorism, and the current strife in Israel. They were not all softballs: he pressed her on accusations that the Clinton administration had failed to take terrorism, and specifically Osama bin Laden, seriously enough.","183":"The Times reporter accepted the offer. Armed with a camera, a global positioning monitor to determine precise location, and a list of camps that Western and Middle Eastern officials have identified as sponsored by Osama bin Laden, the reporter and an Afghan-American interpreter who is sympathetic to the Taliban set out in a Foreign Ministry car with a guide from the Interior Ministry, which conducts surveillance.","1830":"But Osama bin Laden is still at large, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has called the remaining task of flushing out stray Taliban from Afghanistan a 'particularly dirty and unpleasant one.' Almost as unsavory, at least to the men and women at the White House charged with negotiating with Capitol Hill, were the war cries from Democrats angry that Mr. Bush continues to back an economic stimulus bill that they say favors big corporations and the rich. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, who is to meet with the president over breakfast tomorrow, warned that Mr. Bush has to get involved in forging a compromise -- or else.","1831":"LONDON, Dec. 9\u2014 The country's chief law enforcement officer said today that Britain's alliance with the United States made it the likeliest European target for international terrorists like Osama bin Laden and that 'na\u00efve' parliamentary resistance to the government's antiterrorism legislation was increasing the risk.","1832":"Scattered among those ridges are 30 or 40 fortified caves that are the last bastion of Osama bin Laden's hard-core supporters -- and perhaps the hide-out of the terrorist mastermind himself -- the final focus of America's war in Afghanistan.","1833":"Because his city is a principal port of call for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas, Boston's mayor, Thomas M. Menino, assumed he would be alerted to threats made on gas supplies in this country. But when Attorney General John Ashcroft announced recently that Osama bin Laden might have approved a plan for his followers to attack gas supplies, it was news to Mr. Menino.","1834":"Only two or three Taliban leaders have been captured by opposition forces in recent days, including the Taliban army chief of staff, officials said today. And while some in the Osama bin Laden's hierarchy have been killed by bombs or missiles, not one has been captured in Afghanistan, and many are thought to remain in hiding. That includes Mr. bin Laden, whom the United States accuses of masterminding the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","1835":"For several days the main issue has been whether the Afghans would accept such a large force. Now, the debate has shifted to what relationship the new force should have to American military commanders still chasing Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.","1836":"Having discouraged American television news organizations from broadcasting videotapes made by Osama bin Laden, the White House now finds itself in the awkward position of weighing what to do with a new recording that it obviously wants the world to see. It should make the tape public, as it seems inclined to do. The White House never should have gotten into the news management business in the first place.","1837":"In eastern Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden was still on, even as American planes continue to bomb the caves and tunnels of the Tora Bora mountains.","1838":"ROUND ONE -- Nine weeks after American bombs began falling on Afghanistan, a senior Pentagon official said the Taliban government had been defeated. But, with no member of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda hierarchy having been captured in Afghanistan, the official warned that the military campaign was far from over.

In the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden and his followers are believed to be hiding, Afghan tribal forces, supported by American bombs and commandos, were advancing on the group's cave complexes. Some tribal commanders said the group had agreed to lay down arms today, but the deal unraveled early this morning and American B-52's resumed bombing.","1849":"The inquiry received new information from a videotape of Osama bin Laden that was found recently in Afghanistan. The tape has not been released publicly yet, but according to administration officials who have read a transcript, Mr. bin Laden is recorded as saying he had specific expectations of the damage that the attacks would produce, including at least a partial collapse of the World Trade Center towers.","185":"While many of the C.I.A.'s successes in the field under Mr. Tenet remain secret, it is clear, for example, that the agency has played a critical role in dealing with one of the most pressing post-cold-war issues, terrorism. Despite the recent bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen, the agency's advocates say American intelligence has been able to curb other operations organized and inspired by terrorists associated with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","1850":"Your description of Osama bin Laden's amusement at hijackers who 'did not know they had volunteered for a suicide mission' (editorial, Dec. 11) certainly raises some significant questions.","1851":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 11\u2014 Al Jazeera, the Persian Gulf television network, obtained an exclusive interview with Osama bin Laden in October, the only television interview the terrorist leader has given since the war in Afghanistan began. But the network never broadcast the interview, partly because it revealed how much Mr. bin Laden had intimidated the network's correspondent, according to American and Middle Eastern government officials.","1852":"BREAKDOWN AT TORA BORA -- American bombers laid a heavy barrage across the snowcapped mountains of Tora Bora as efforts to arrange a surrender of embattled Osama bin Laden fighters broke down.

[Excerpts, Page B6.]","1854":"Most people said they were now confident that Osama bin Laden would be captured or killed by the United States. Men were even more confident than women that United States forces would capture or kill the Al Qaeda leader.","1856":"Osama bin Laden was not named as a defendant in today's 31-page indictment. This preserves the option of bringing Mr. bin Laden before a military commission if he is taken alive by American forces, officials said. Mr. bin Laden is already under indictment in New York, charged in the conspiracy to bomb two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998.","1857":"The administration considered having a military commission handle the Moussaoui case. Under the president's lamentable order authorizing the tribunals, any foreigner implicated in terrorist acts could be subject to their jurisdiction. Mr. Moussaoui should not be considered the exception because he was arrested on American soil, or because there appears to be a great deal of circumstantial evidence against him. Anyone charged with being involved in the attacks, including Osama bin Laden, should stand trial in an ordinary American court, regardless of where that person is arrested or how challenging his prosecution might seem.","1858":"Is Osama bin Laden still in Afghanistan? Is a wholesale surrender by Al Qaeda in the offing? Have large numbers of Mr. bin Laden's recruits slipped over the border into Pakistan? The answers to these and other crucial questions are as elusive as who holds sway over large pockets of a struggling and threadbare Afghanistan.","1859":"These intelligence officials also said that they believed that Osama bin Laden and many of the surviving leaders of Al Qaeda were holed up in the mountains in the Tora Bora area of eastern Afghanistan, dismissing reports that Mr. bin Laden had tried to flee into Pakistan in recent days.","186":"American investigators have been trying to determine whether the Cole attack was directed by Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi who faces charges in the bombings on Aug. 7, 1998, of the embassies in Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The attacks killed 224 people and wounded thousands.","1860":"In a broad sense, the government appears to have calculated that Mr. Moussaoui's trial is its best, and possibly only, chance to lay before the world the case that Osama bin Laden and his network were responsible for the attacks.","1861":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 12\u2014 American intelligence agencies have warned that Osama bin Laden and his aides may try to escape by sea aboard one of several cargo ships that Al Qaeda and its supporters have acquired in recent years, Bush administration officials say.","1862":"The commanders of the Afghan tribal forces -- spurred by American pressure and the possibility of a $25 million reward -- are now demanding that Al Qaeda forces turn over their leader, Osama bin Laden, although his presence in these eastern Afghan mountains could not be confirmed.","1863":"Until now, the State Department has resisted lobbying from American Jewish organizations and lawmakers to advertise rewards for Palestinian-related terrorism. Instead, it has confined its public appeals for information to terrorist suspects like Osama bin Laden (up to a $25 million reward) and organizations like Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement.","1864":"DEADLINE FOR SURRENDER -- Afghan fighters set a new deadline of Thursday for Al Qaeda loyalists bottled up in canyons and caves to give up, after an agreement for a surrender yesterday morning collapsed in confusion.

A1","1865":"In recent weeks, as criticism of Saudi Arabia has swirled in the Western press, some Saudi officials have taken steps to defend the kingdom's reputation, particularly against allegations of noncooperation in the war on terrorism. In interviews, a series of senior Saudi officials have agreed to speak publicly about the Sept. 11 attacks, which American officials have said were led by the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and his organization, Al Qaeda, and about their government's attempts to combat terrorism.","1866":"But maybe the misty skies were the right thing. After all, if anyone thought the work of Osama bin Laden and his trained terrorists on Sept. 11 was not something personal, that was laid to rest by the images and words released on videotape by the Bush administration yesterday.","1867":"No group took responsibility, and government officials refused to speculate publicly on who might have done it. But suspicion fell on Al Qaeda, the terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden, and Islamic militant groups based in Pakistan that have sought to end Indian control over part of Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim border area that India considers a state in its union.","1868":"But when Osama bin Laden interrupted her peach Danish this morning, Ms. Brown said she longed to smash through her TV screen and strangle him.","1869":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13\u2014 The tape that was released today by the White House offers an unparalleled glimpse into the world of Osama bin Laden and like-minded Islamic extremists.","187":"Mr. al-'Owhali, 24, faces trial with three other men, charged with taking part in a terrorist conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","1870":"THE VIDEOTAPE -- An amateur videotape released by the United States showed Osama bin Laden laughing and boasting about the Sept. 11 attacks, saying that the planes that flew into the trade center towers did more damage than he had imagined they would. Administration officials called the tape highly incriminating proof that Mr. bin Laden was guilty in the attacks. A1","1871":"MILAN, Dec. 13\u2014 For two years, Stefano Dambruoso, a young prosecutor, and his team in Milan have been after a group they are calling Europe's main logistical support center for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network.","1872":"Following are excerpts from the transcript of the videotape released yesterday by the Pentagon showing Osama bin Laden discussing the Sept. 11 attacks during a visit to a Sheik al-Ghamdi, possibly in mid-November in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

Then he turned and walked briskly back to the Oval Office, saying nothing about the tape of Osama bin Laden that his administration was preparing to release, or the mounting violence between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.","1878":"The images may be grainy and the audio a bit garbled, but the essence of the man comes through with chilling clarity. The videotape released yesterday by the Department of Defense captures the evil of Osama bin Laden in a candid, unguarded moment. This was not a piece of propaganda produced for wide distribution, but rather the recording of an intimate, informal gathering in early November between a relaxed bin Laden and a few gleeful followers who seem almost giddy that the Sept. 11 attacks were far deadlier than expected.","188":"Prosecutors say the statement is critical in their case against the defendant, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, who faces trial with three other defendants in the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and a nearly simultaneous attack on the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998. Prosecutors say that the blasts, which killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands, were part of a terrorist conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","1880":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13\u2014 The United States released a videotape today showing Osama bin Laden laughing and boasting about the Sept. 11 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people.","1881":"The images were shadowy and the voices at times muffled, but in the videotape made public by the United States government, Osama bin Laden and his guests, gathered together for dinner somewhere in Afghanistan in November, were certainly gleeful as they told and retold the terrible events of Sept. 11.","1882":"CAIRO, Dec. 13\u2014 The videotape of Osama bin Laden that was released today is unlikely to change the minds of those Arabs who already suspect the worst of the United States.","1883":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 13\u2014 American-backed forces believe that they have surrounded Osama bin Laden and the last of his hard-core fighters in a complex of caves between two valleys just south of here, a senior American military official said tonight.","1884":"CAIRO, Dec. 14\u2014 The Muslim clerics mentioned on the latest Osama bin Laden videotape, along with his Saudi dinner guest, are seemingly low-level religious figures known more for their anti-Western fervor than for having any widespread following in the kingdom or elsewhere, Saudi sources and Western diplomats said today.","1886":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14\u2014 The Osama bin Laden videotape is raising new questions among intelligence officials about why American authorities failed to uncover the plot of the Sept. 11 attacks before they occurred.","1887":"'Portrait of a Terrorist' (editorial, Dec. 14) notes that before the videotape of Osama bin Laden 'can be admitted in any legal proceeding,' 'other details will have to be provided.' You overlooked that it would be admissible in a trial before a military tribunal.","1888":"The attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 set off a flurry of rumors and conspiracy theories among Muslims unwilling to lay the blame on Osama bin Laden -- or any Muslim. It was Israel, they declared. Or American white supremacists. Or fanatical Christians.","1889":"We were all appalled and nauseated by the heinousness and glee of Osama bin Laden in proudly proclaiming his responsibility for the slaughter of thousands of innocents. It should, however, come as no surprise. Leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been proudly doing the same after the intentional slaughter of innocent civilians in Israel.","189":"From the beginning, Mr. Cohen promised a thorough accounting of the circumstances that led to the Cole attack, which American investigators suspect was carried out by Islamic militants linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi fugitive accused of sponsoring the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","1890":"New York has the most copious record prosecuting terrorists of any jurisdiction in the land. Over the past eight years the U.S. attorney, Mary Jo White, has successfully prosecuted 26 jihad conspirators, in six major trials and some minor ones. They include a charismatic, hate-preaching Egyptian sheik with a large cult following and several associates of Osama bin Laden. The parade of justice has continued, under heightened security but unabated, since the Sept. 11 attacks. Five weeks after the twin towers fell, four bin Laden associates were trooped into a courtroom and sentenced to life without parole for the U.S. embassy bombings. Another fairly senior Al Qaeda suspect in the East Africa bombings is about to come to trial.","1891":"Just two weeks ago, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld dismissed the idea of detaining large numbers of Taliban or Al Qaeda prisoners, beyond top leaders like Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden. But this week, he announced that American forces in Afghanistan would very likely take a sizable number of prisoners into custody.","1892":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Saturday, Dec. 15\u2014 American and British commandos, operating behind a screen of local Afghan fighters, had the last remnants of Osama bin Laden's followers -- and perhaps the terrorist mastermind himself -- cornered here this morning in a narrow stretch of a ridge line, canyons and caves high in the White Mountains.","1893":"As an American Muslim, I have no doubt that Osama bin Laden sponsored the horrific attacks of Sept. 11. In the final analysis, however, the release of the purported 'smoking gun' videotape (front page, Dec. 14) will probably not have a significant impact on world opinion.","1894":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14\u2014 In reaching their assessment that Osama bin Laden is probably still in the mountains of Afghanistan near Tora Bora, American commanders are relying on high-tech surveillance equipment, but also on surmise and on reports from local Afghan fighters who are helping in the fight against his forces there.","1895":"Two months ago, the war in Afghanistan seemed dauntingly open-ended. Taliban and Al Qaeda forces controlled 90 percent of the land. The local opposition was in disarray. Mullah Muhammad Omar reigned in Kabul and blustered in Kandahar. Finding Osama bin Laden seemed hopeless.","1896":"The videotape of Osama bin Laden boasting about and gloating over the Sept. 11 attacks (front page, Dec. 14) shows him to be nothing less than the ruthless, calculating, odious individual we all knew he was.","1897":"While it may seem like the ultimate smoking gun, defense lawyers said there would be ways to try to undercut the videotape of Osama bin Laden if he were to go on trial for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","1898":"Washington has declared zero tolerance of terrorism, but has also relied heavily on Pakistan in its war against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. The question is whether to continue urging restraint by India, or to allow India -- as the United States has with Israel -- to retaliate for suicide bombings.","1899":"Mr. Blair, who enjoyed a warm friendship with Bill Clinton, has surprised many by forging a close relationship with George W. Bush. More than that, he has been America's indispensable ally. In October, when Washington was reluctant to publish its initial evidence that Osama bin Laden was behind the Sept. 11 attacks for fear of compromising intelligence sources, Mr. Blair drew up a white paper accusing Al Qaeda, relying on information gathered by British intelligence services.","19":"Jordanian security agents said 13 men imprisoned in Amman on charges of plotting terrorist attacks in Jordan had been trained in Afghan camps operated by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi fugitive. A4","190":"All four defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges they conspired with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that included the blasts in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998, which killed 224 people and wounded thousands.","1900":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14\u2014 The Bush administration moved today to make the newest Osama bin Laden tape the centerpiece of an effort to convince the Arab world, and the larger Muslim one, that the Saudi terrorist does not deserve their allegiance.","1901":"At first, the thought was to give Americans poetic tools like 'Osama bin Laden,' 'evil' and even 'hate.' But cooler -- or more risk-averse -- heads prevailed. 'Basically we took all the words from the songs 'America the Beautiful,' 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and 'God Bless America,'' Kapell says. 'That alone gives you around 300.' Then he watched a lot of news coverage on TV, 'taking down all the words out of people's mouths.' The total of a thousand words were reduced by four-fifths, then added to the company's standard 200 'bits and pieces': connectors like 'I,' 'we' and 'the' and modifiers like '-ed,' '-ing' and '-ly.' An agnostic, Kapell agonized over 'God,' but O.K.'d it -- he knew it would be missed. Same for 'president,' in whom Kapell says he has similarly imperfect faith.","1903":"IT looks so ordinary. Men are sitting in a small white room on the floor near some gray, flowered throw pillows. They are laughing, drinking, eating with their hands, adjusting their turbans. A visitor identified in the transcript as a sheik sits next to Osama bin Laden. He exclaims what a nice pad Mr. bin Laden has, how clean and comfortable the guest quarters are.","1904":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 15\u2014 The United States has intercepted radio communications in recent days that officials said appeared to record Osama bin Laden giving orders to Al Qaeda troops in the mountainous region around Tora Bora, where Afghan and American soldiers are engaged in fierce combat with the enemy.","1905":"A. Maybe it's a twin conclusion. One is that certainty is the enemy of decency and humanity in people who are sure they are right, like Osama bin Laden and John Ashcroft. And secondly that for this country at least, given the kind of obstreperous, populous, diverse country we are, law is the absolute essential. And when governments short-cut the law, it's extremely dangerous.","1906":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 15\u2014 Even as American forces and their Afghan allies close in on Al Qaeda fighters in the mountains here, the forbidding terrain and the stubbornness of some of the foreign followers of Osama bin Laden are making the struggle for Tora Bora the most complex battle of the war.","1907":"And that brings me to the Osama bin Laden tape just released. What was most chilling about that tape was not bin Laden's boasting about his mass murder. What was most chilling was the unidentified Saudi sheik sitting next to him, who so eagerly nodded his head in agreement with everything bin Laden said, and who assured him that in the mosques in Saudi Arabia the reaction to the terror acts had been 'very positive.'","1909":"In its efforts to obtain the continued cooperation of Pakistan in the fight against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the Bush administration had refrained from pushing too hard for it to clamp down on the two organizations, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, which operate openly in Pakistan and advocate violence to drive India out of Kashmir.","1910":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 15\u2014 The siege of Osama bin Laden's band of followers, trapped high in the White Mountains, ebbed from fighting to surrender negotiations again today -- but the heavy American bombing of the ridges and peaks continued unabated.","1911":"For three months, Mr. Putin has cheered America from the sidelines, offering political support at the United Nations and opening for Washington a library of Russian intelligence dossiers on Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda's terror network, which has plagued Russia and Central Asia for years.","1912":"On Dec. 1, American planes attacked several villages near the mountainous redoubt of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda fighters -- and perhaps even Osama bin Laden -- were presumed to be hiding. It was an inauspicious beginning to a furious air campaign.","1913":"OSAMA BIN LADEN -- In a week that marked the three-month anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, United States forces and their allies in Afghanistan penetrated an increasingly fierce circle of Taliban fighters in the mountainous area of Tora Bora and concluded that the cave sheltering Osama bin Laden, the leader of the Qaeda terror network, might be at hand. Suddenly, it seemed possible that he would soon be apprehended -- alive or dead.","1914":"The war in Afghanistan moved inexorably toward a climax. American warplanes bombed the ridge positions and cave and tunnel hideouts of Al Qaeda's remnant forces in the eastern mountains around Tora Bora, and on the ground the Afghan militia was closing in on what may be Osama bin Laden's last redoubt.","1915":"TAKING PRISONERS -- Local Afghan leaders warned that the harsh terrain of Tora Bora and the tenacity of some of the foreign followers of Osama bin Laden might prolong the campaign. A1","1916":"General Cimatu contended that the rebels were linked to Al Qaeda, the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden. But the evidence he offered was circumstantial.","1917":"CAIRO, Dec. 15\u2014 The United States faces an uphill battle in using the latest videotape of Osama bin Laden to influence public opinion in the Arab world, where Washington's support for Israel over the Palestinians dominates news coverage and the public tends to regard the fight to dismantle Al Qaeda as something of an American problem.","1918":"The monumental task of rebuilding Afghanistan after the war has been made far more difficult, experts say, by a problem that would have existed even without the Taliban and Osama bin Laden: the drought that has gripped the country and much of southwestern Asia for three years.","1919":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 15\u2014 The Saudi who was seen visiting Osama bin Laden in the videotape released this week is a 38-year-old veteran of conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya who left the kingdom most recently on Sept. 21, a senior Saudi official said today.","192":"The United Nations special envoy for Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, arrived in Kabul to discuss with the ruling Taliban their harboring of the fugitive Saudi Osama bin Laden, among other matters. The Taliban's refusal to expel him and shut down guerrilla training camps led the Security Council on Jan. 18 to impose new sanctions on Afghanistan. Christopher S. Wren (NYT)","1920":"But these forms of egotism are piddling compared with the grandiosity of religiosity displayed by Osama bin Laden on the tape released by the White House last week, cloaking conceit in asceticism and mass murder in spirituality.","1921":"Fantasies of evil and dreams of victory over its agents are increasing in voltage, needless to say, in response to the terrible events of recent times. Osama bin Laden, in fact, appears eerily to be continuing Sauron and Voldemort's legacy (as well as, perhaps, the earlier ambitions of the lethal, foreign antagonists of James Bond).","1922":"STILL AT LARGE -- For one thing, Osama bin Laden has yet to be located, let alone captured or killed. For the United States, that is a critical bit of unfinished business since Mr. bin Laden has been identified as the mastermind of the deadly attacks that sent America to war. But it is not necessarily so for the local Afghan commanders, who want most of all to cleanse their land of Mr. bin Laden and his foreign fighters. For them, capturing the man himself has been a challenge, but not the main goal. 'If he's here, it is our responsibility to catch him,' said Commander Zaman Ali. 'But he's not here.'","1923":"Mr. Bush's central goal, capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants, remains largely unfulfilled. Military officials say they have no idea how many Al Qaeda leaders have been killed in the last week, but they know that none of the two dozen or so top leaders of the group who have been identified as targets by the United States have been taken prisoner.","1924":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 16\u2014 Two retired Pakistani nuclear scientists suspected of passing nuclear secrets to Osama bin Laden have been released and declared innocent, the son of one of them said today.","1925":"As I watched the tape of Osama bin Laden boasting that the World Trade Center carnage went beyond even his own twisted imaginings, I thought of my conversations with Brendan Gallagher, a trader who transferred just a month before the attack from Cantor Fitzgerald, near the top of Tower 1, to Euro Brokers on the 84th floor of Tower 2.","1926":"But since Sept. 11, the president has kept his personal belief in Christianity unusually private -- he would not say this week whether he still reads the Bible every day -- as he has made extraordinary gestures to Islam. The politics here are as obvious as they are praised, particularly by Muslims pleased that the White House has continually said that its war is against Osama bin Laden and not the prophet Muhammad.","1927":"Instead, Mr. Rumsfeld told Hamid Karzai, the provisional head of government, and Gen. Muhammad Fahim, the incoming defense minister, that much work remained in hunting down the Taliban and members of Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda.","1928":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 16\u2014 American officials said today that Al Qaeda had been effectively destroyed in Afghanistan, and Afghan commanders here declared victory in the fierce battle for the mountain stronghold of Osama bin Laden's organization. But neither Americans nor Afghans said they knew where Mr. bin Laden was.","1929":"A BATTLE ENDS -- American officials said Al Qaeda had been effectively destroyed in Afghanistan, and Afghan commanders declared victory in the fierce battle for Tora Bora,the mountain stronghold of Osama bin Laden's organization. But neither Americans nor Afghans said they knew where Mr. bin Laden was. A1","193":"United States investigators, for example, are trying to track down about a dozen fugitives in the case who are believed to be hiding overseas, including Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is charged in the East Africa attacks and is also suspected in the attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen Oct. 12.","1930":"Earlier this year, Hamid Karzai, convinced that Osama bin Laden had become the puppet master of Afghanistan, decided to return from exile to help lead the resistance, Qayum Karzai said. He said Hamid Karzai had expected long years of dangerous political insurgency while other nations continued to ignore Afghanistan's collapse. Then came Sept. 11.","1931":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 17\u2014 Hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters have fled from the caves of Tora Bora into the snow-capped mountains that mark the Pakistan border, and Osama bin Laden may be among them, according to United States intelligence officials, who acknowledged today that they had lost track of him.","1932":"'I was going to the New Jersey Sports Authority, but Osama bin Laden had other plans,' he said.","1933":"TRACKING BIN LADEN -- Hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters have fled the caves of Tora Bora into the snow-capped mountains on the border with Pakistan, and Osama bin Laden may be among them, according to United States intelligence officials, who acknowledged that they had lost track of him. The officials thought they had a bead on Mr. bin Laden's location until sometime Saturday, when radio traffic and other communications they had been intercepting between Al Qaeda leaders dried up. A1","1934":"The war aims of the United States and the anti-Taliban opposition do not always neatly coincide. Here at Tora Bora, Afghan forces were concerned principally with recovering territory while the United States was intent on the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden, who has eluded his pursuers.","1935":"American military officials have also indicated a preference for a smaller force, arguing that a large contingent of peacekeepers could complicate the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","1936":"On April 30, 1945, as Soviet troops closed in on central Berlin, Adolf Hitler bid farewell to the aides gathered in his bunker beneath the Reich Chancellery and killed himself with a bullet to the head. Many Americans grew up with a vision of war as something that ends with that kind of finality. Since then we have become acquainted with more inconclusive finales. As America searches for Osama bin Laden in the mountainous wilderness of eastern Afghanistan, we are learning that even in victory, finding the end point can be frustratingly elusive.","1937":"Last week, the courtly 59-year-old lawyer learned that his instincts had been right. He was assigned to defend the only person indicted so far in the events of Sept. 11, Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan ancestry who is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the attacks.","1938":"Jaish-e-Muhammad (meaning Army of Muhammad) is essentially a spinoff of another militant Pakistani organization, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, and is suspected of receiving support from Osama bin Laden.","1939":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 17\u2014 NATO troops have raided the offices of an American charity in Kosovo as part of an investigation that, according to the Bush administration, links at least two large Muslim charities based in Illinois to fund-raising for Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network.","194":"It is there that Osama bin Laden, named from the outset as a prime suspect in the Cole attack, lives in sanctuary under the protection of the Taliban, the hard-line Islamic movement that rules 90 percent of Afghanistan.","1940":"Editorials: The hunt for Osama bin Laden; dimming prospects for farm reform; Andr\u00e9s Martinez on the train to Newark Airport.","1941":"LONDON, Dec. 17\u2014 A London-based Saudi businessman and two Egyptians lost a three-year battle today to avoid extradition to New York to stand trial on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in bombing the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","1942":"Yet the family has to eat, and the only way to get food is to work the land -- even if every step is dangerous. This makes the problem of land mines central to any discussion of Afghanistan's future, for the mines are a critical impediment to the country's recovery. Long after Osama bin Laden is buried, after a new government is presiding over Afghanistan's reconstruction, land mines will continue to haunt this country.","1943":"It is the supporters of terrorism in the mountains of Tora Bora who are looking terrified these days. Exhausted and whimpering, vanquished fighters for Osama bin Laden were paraded for the cameras yesterday by their new Afghan jailers as visual aids for the continuing story of Al Qaeda on the run.","1944":"The absence of any confirmed evidence tying Iraq to either the Sept. 11 or anthrax attacks increases the difficulty of convincing Arabs that it is necessary to strike now. An American attack could well enhance the perception that the United States was making Muslims its target and thus unravel the reluctant Arab support for dismantling Osama bin Laden's network of terror.","1945":"He may also shed new light on the underground financial connections between Al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia, which American officials say supplied Osama bin Laden with much of the funding for his organization.","1946":"Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in the Hadhramaut region of Yemen, is believed to have followers in dozens of countries.","1947":"The fighters have killed many of the enemy, too. About 200 Al Qaeda fighters died in the last two weeks of combat in Tora Bora. But the fate of a larger number of the terror group's soldiers -- the estimates range from 500 to 1,500 -- is not known. They may have gotten away, possibly with their leader, Osama bin Laden, whose skills at evasion continue to confound the coalition.","1948":"A videotape discovered earlier and made public by the White House last week showed Osama bin Laden at an informal gathering talking extensively about his knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Mr. Bush called that tape 'a devastating declaration of guilt for this evil person.'","1949":"If he ever meets Osama bin Laden, he said: 'I would have him arrested before he could reach my room. I would have him face a trial.'","195":"Although the record has been erratic, presidents have at times adopted more forceful approaches. President Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes after the East Africa embassy bombings. Those strikes were aimed at Osama bin Laden -- whom Washington accuses of being the mastermind of the attacks -- even though the bin Laden-inspired terrorist apparatus is a stateless organization of anti-American Islamic militants.","1950":"The F.B.I.'s team here -- the only one in Afghanistan -- includes agents from New York and Washington who are devoted to the multiple, intertwined investigations into Osama bin Laden and his network. Those investigations cover not only the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but also the suicide attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October 2000 and the simultaneous bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","1951":"Two days ago, the commanders of an eastern anti-Taliban alliance declared that their men had totally defeated the final remnants of Osama bin Laden's troops in their midst. The grim conveyance of the rotting bodies might have seemed evidence of their boasts.","1952":"MOSCOW\u2014 Anyone in Washington planning to take the war on terrorism to Iraq after Osama bin Laden is eliminated should not count on Russia's help -- at least for now. The word here when you ask about marching on Baghdad is very simple: 'Nyet.'","1953":"Since the resistance of Al Qaeda fighters in Tora Bora began to crumble in recent days, the United States has been pressing, with mixed results, to seal possible escape routes for Osama bin Laden and other leaders of his terrorist group.","1954":"Escalating tensions -- or worse yet, an outbreak of war -- between the two nuclear-armed nations could distract, if not destabilize Pakistan when the United States needs the help of its military government to capture Osama bin Laden, who may escape from southern Afghanistan into Pakistan -- if he hasn't already.","1955":"Now, as part of his consultations with intermediaries, Colonel Qadaffi was said to have offered intelligence information on members of Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorist organization, including a number of Libyans who are said to have served on Mr. bin Laden's personal protection force.","1956":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 19\u2014 Frustrated by the failure to capture Osama bin Laden, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan has proposed that United States marines or Army troops be deployed to comb the wild terrain of Tora Bora to try to determine the fate of Al Qaeda leaders, American officials said today.","1957":"General Musharraf must crack down on terrorist groups operating in his own country. Urgent action is needed after the attack last week on India's Parliament, attributed by India to militant groups in Pakistan. In addition, hundreds of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters have slipped into Pakistan's mountainous northwestern frontier, where there is strong resistance to General Musharraf's embrace of America. Troops loyal to Osama bin Laden clashed with their Pakistani captors yesterday.","1959":"Some now say they sharply disagreed with his decision not to hand over Osama bin Laden to the United States after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, according to one person close to several Taliban leaders. He said he had spoken with some of them in recent days.","196":"The history of Courtroom 318 as the site of terrorism trials continues tomorrow. Four men go on trial, charged with conspiring in the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998 and in other acts of terrorism, the government says, that were orchestrated by one man, the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","1960":"ADEN, Yemen, Dec. 19\u2014 Troop reinforcements moved into the remote hills of central Yemen today where government forces have battled tribesmen in an assault to capture suspected operatives of Osama bin Laden.","1961":"PARIS, Dec. 19\u2014 Belgian police have arrested a Tunisian-born man they say had intense contacts with Muslim militants across Europe and recruited men for training in the camps of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","1962":"The Pakistanis find their situation particularly distressing, Mr. Ahmad said. The United States has relied on Pakistan in its battle against the Taliban and in the search for Osama bin Laden.","1963":"That would seem to sum up the news out of Afghanistan in the last few days, which is why the United States military there, frustrated by the fruitless search for Osama bin Laden, has asked the Pentagon to send more troops to scour the caves and tunnels of Tora Bora.","1964":"The capture or killing of Osama bin Laden is a finite goal with a finite result. The larger and more difficult goal is battling the poverty and despair in the Middle East that turn the disenfranchised to Osama bin Laden's radical solutions.","1965":"His words presented a warning to Pakistan's military rulers and to countries in the United States-led coalition to press for action against militants acting openly in Pakistan. Many here fear that if diplomatic action fails, India will take action that could lead to war. That, in turn, would distract Pakistan from the hunt for Osama bin Laden at a crucial time, when he is on the run, perhaps to Pakistan.","1966":"FORCES IN YEMEN -- Troop reinforcements moved into the remote hills of central Yemen, where government forces have battled tribesmen in an effort to capture suspected operatives of Osama bin Laden. B2","1967":"'Newt was a lot easier' to caricature, said Senator John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat from Louisiana whom the White House has tried to co-opt in its search for a compromise stimulus plan. 'It was not a lot of heavy lifting. Tom is not a good target. He's not someone you can put up on a wall like Osama bin Laden. He's nice, he's likable, he's genuine.'","1968":"THE VIDEOTAPE -- A government translator said a more meticulous review of the videotape released last week revealed that Osama bin Laden uttered the names of more of the hijackers than previously disclosed. B3","1969":"All in all, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, or I.S.I., is responsible for many more killings than Osama bin Laden.","197":"The trial of four men charged with conspiring in the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998 and in other acts of terrorism that the government says were orchestrated by one man, the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, opens in Federal District Court in Manhattan tomorrow. 27","1970":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 20\u2014 In the videotape released by the United States last week, Osama bin Laden uttered the names of more of the hijackers in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack than previously disclosed, a translator working for the government said tonight.","1971":"Frustrated that his image has been battered since he left office, Mr. Clinton summoned several of his aides and advisers on Wednesday to devise ways to remind the public of his accomplishments and defend his legacy against criticism on matters including his role in the current recession and his failure to strike a fatal blow against Osama bin Laden or his terrorist network after the embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998.","1972":"There were few new developments on the Afghan war front today. For the third consecutive day, scores of American warplanes were sent into the skies over Tora Bora, the mountainous redoubt where Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding last week, and Kandahar, the former Taliban stronghold in the south, without dropping any bombs.","1973":"The United States has also asked its allies to freeze the assets of another Pakistani group that is run by two nuclear scientists who visited Osama bin Laden earlier this year.","1974":"It's hardly surprising that Osama bin Laden's trail went cold shortly after the United States publicly announced that it had been tracking him through intercepted radio transmissions. This is one case where our interests would have been better served by being kept in the dark.","1975":"Prince Bandar criticized many of those reports, including the ones that have portrayed Saudi Arabia as teaching hatred of non-Muslims in its schools and paying protection money to supporters of Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident.","1976":"But the situation is highly complicated. The group Mr. Bush took aim at today, Lashkar-e-Taiba, has been linked to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization, by American officials but has never appeared on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations. It has been supported by elements of the Pakistani Army, including the Inter-Services Intelligence branch. It is one of more than a dozen insurgent groups fighting India in the Himalayan state of Kashmir, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan.","1977":"The first duty of any law enforcement or military officer is to 'know your enemy.' Yet President Bush continues to refer to Osama bin Laden and his associates, like those on the videotape of Mr. bin Laden released last week, merely as 'evil people' -- the sort of simplistic moral denunciation that only makes the behavior of terrorists more incomprehensible by ascribing to them vague and inaccurate motives. The Justice Department continues to view Mr. bin Laden's terrorist followers essentially as criminals and continues to employ tactics that would seem of more use against smugglers, drug dealers or racketeers than against religious soldiers. Attorney General John Ashcroft's roundup of hundreds of supposedly suspicious aliens, a tactic worthy of a small-town police department, is revealing of a particularly archaic approach to suspect profiling.","1978":"MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 21\u2014 Somali police said today that they had arrested four Iraqi Kurds and a Palestinian for questioning over possible links to Osama bin Laden or to his Al Qaeda network or other extremist groups.","1979":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 21\u2014 An instructor at a Minnesota flight school warned the F.B.I. in August of his suspicion that a student who was later identified as a part of Osama bin Laden's terror network might be planning to use a commercial plane loaded with fuel as a weapon, a member of Congress and other officials said today.","198":"A court transcript suggests that the first witness in the embassy bombing trial will be a man who once worked for Osama bin Laden. PAGE B1","1980":"PRISONERS AND PATIENTS -- The Pentagon said additional American troops would be sent to search the Tora Bora caves. There was still no sign of Osama bin Laden, suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, or of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, who slipped away when Kandahar fell earlier this month. Mr. bin Laden may have gone into hiding in Pakistan, though reports cited Somalia or Yemen as alternatives.","1981":"And it brought Firefighter Higgins to the place that gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, who has been blamed for the plot that killed his brother, Lt. Timothy Higgins, a firefighter who died when the World Trade Center fell. Joseph Higgins pulled his brother's body out of that wreckage.","1982":"Before and even after Sept. 11, America was not involved in the civil war in Afghanistan. Our part in the hostilities did not begin until the Taliban refused to surrender Osama bin Laden. As late as October, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said moderate Taliban leaders could be part of a new Afghan government. John Walker Lindh joined the Taliban army in May to protect what he saw as a Muslim utopia with no evident enemy in America. He had no control over later developments at higher levels.","1983":"The American bombing of Afghanistan has largely abated since anti-Taliban forces declared last weekend that they had captured the mountainous redoubt of Tora Bora, where Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda warriors were thought to be hiding. But American combat aircraft did strike a convoy west of Khost.","1984":"In the hunt for Al Qaeda members -- and their leader, Osama bin Laden -- about 50 Special Operations troops have been working with anti-Taliban forces or operating independently at Tora Bora, Pentagon and military officials said in recent days. Some British forces are also deployed.","1985":"FOREIGN FIGHTERS -- Eighteen Arab members of Al Qaeda said the ferocity of the American airstrikes on Tora Bora broke their fighting spirit and turned what had seemed to be an impregnable fortress for Osama bin Laden into a frigid, barren zone. The fighters were wounded in the raids and taken to a hospital in Jalalabad, where they gave their first interviews since being captured. B1","1986":"WASHINGTON\u2014 AS the United States ponders whether to expand the war on terrorism to Iraq, various officials and ex-officials have tried to connect the dots between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Administration officials debate the credibility of claims by Czech officials of a meeting in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence officer and Mr. bin Laden's leading suicide operative in the Sept. 11 attacks. R. James Woolsey, the former director of central intelligence, has tried to link Mr. Hussein to the anthrax attacks in America.","1987":"In the audience was Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of the United States-led campaign that brought down the Taliban and routed Osama bin Laden's terrorism network, which is blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.","1988":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 22\u2014 Tora Bora seemed to be an impregnable fortress when Osama bin Laden controlled the high ground. For a group of patients in the public hospital here it was a frigid, barren zone where they said they were terrorized by American airstrikes.","1989":"MILITARY CAMPAIGN -- There was a price for the reliance on Afghan opposition forces on the ground, and the United States has begun paying it. Afghan commanders considered the war over when they captured the mountainous territory of Tora Bora, while American and allied forces prepared to send a large force to search its caves themselves for Al Qaeda leaders, especially Osama bin Laden. Many fighters have already escaped into Pakistan. Phase 2 in the war on terror, Page 3.","199":"The trial in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa is to begin today in Federal District Court in Manhattan amid signs that the government's first witness will be an informer who once worked for Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. B1","1990":"But when these private plaintiffs try to collect on their judgments, they may find themselves at odds with the the State Department. If the government has frozen a rogue nation's assets, for instance, it may want to use that property as leverage to achieve a foreign policy objective rather than handing hundreds of millions of dollars of it over to a single plaintiff and his lawyers. Relying on the 1996 change in the laws, at least one suit against Afghanistan (as well as Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban) has already been filed in federal court in New York, by a New Jersey woman on behalf of her husband, who was killed in the World Trade Center attacks. Under the 1996 law, however, cases against Afghanistan face serious obstacles, because Afghanistan was not one of the six nations on the State Department's list of sponsors of terrorism that year.","1991":"The hunt went on for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. In a Pakistan hospital, 18 foreign Al Qaeda fighters, captured and wounded, told of the hell they had faced in Tora Bora -- the ferocious American bombing, the lack of food and supplies, the terrible cold. Still, they voiced no regrets at having left their homelands to join Mr. bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks that killed 3,000 people.","1992":"Six of the top 10 queries this year were related to those topics. They included requests for information about Nostradamus, the 16th-century soothsayer who wrote that 'the third big war will begin when the big city is burning,' at No 1; CNN, the news organization, No. 2; the World Trade Center, No. 3; anthrax, No. 5; Osama bin Laden, No. 7, and Taliban, No. 9, according to the Google Zeitgeist, which tracks trends in the site's traffic patterns.","1993":"WASHINGTON\u2014 NO one knew last week whether Osama bin Laden had moved to Pakistan; he hadn't sent out change-of-address cards. But the war certainly began to shift there -- to a country where the terrain is more hospitable than Tora Bora, but the politics are a lot less forgiving for Americans.","1994":"The British-led security force will report to Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the leader of the United States Central Command, which is overseeing the American military campaign in Afghanistan. That arrangement is intended to preserve unity of command and to ensure that the new international security force does not interfere with the American-led search for Osama bin Laden. In practice, General McColl is expected to have considerable autonomy.","1995":"Re 'A Hemings Family Turns From Black, to White, to Black' (Editorial Observer, Dec. 17), by Brent Staples: Recent debate about Thomas Jefferson has been dominated by the contrast between his personal slaveholding and his public human rights vision. But after the attacks of Sept. 11, it is time to also examine the stark contrast between Jefferson's Enlightenment-era vision and Osama bin Laden's medieval one.","1996":"Mr. Karzai said American forces were welcome to stay until terrorists were ousted from his country, and he pledged again to turn over Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, if they are caught. It was still not clear if a convoy attacked by American planes last week carried Al Qaeda or Taliban leaders, as American officials said, or tribal elders heading to Kabul, as some survivors contended.","1997":"Earlier in the day, Mr. Giuliani, chosen as Time's person of the year over Osama bin Laden, said that all New Yorkers shared in his recognition. He said he was glad that the distinction had not gone to Mr. bin Laden.","1998":"Over the past two months, similar calls have cleaved hundreds of other families whose lives are tethered to Fort Drum, the northeast's biggest military installation and home to the 10th Mountain Division, the fabled quick-strike battalion whose members have been scouring Afghanistan's craggy terrain in search of Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda. Although a spokesman for the base would not discuss troop deployments, Army officials say at least 1,000 men and women from the division have been sent to Central Asia since October, with many others poised to join them.","1999":"'Let Bush do what he will; our duty as Muslims is to follow the teachings of the holy prophet,' Mr. Minhas said during an hour-long tour of the campus in which he waved away any questions relating to the activities of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the attacks of Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden or the disputed territory of Kashmir, where Lashkar's Islamic fighters have been challenging Indian rule for much of the past decade. 'We are not frightened of Bush, we are only fearful of God.'","2":"Pakistan, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are the only countries that recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban government, which, as the host to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born exile accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, is not usually blessed as a peacemaker.","20":"Separately, Mr. Tenet provided the Senate panel with a broad review of global threats facing the United States, including terrorism. He said that United States intelligence officials believe that Osama bin Laden, charged in the 1998 bombing of two American embassies in Africa, had developed new tactics to try to strike American interests with his terrorist network. Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is now living in Afghanistan. Mr. Tenet said the United States believed that Mr. bin Laden's terrorist organization, along with other terrorist groups, were now 'placing increased emphasis on developing surrogates to carry out attacks in an effort to avoid detection.'","200":"The trial in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa is to begin this morning in Federal District Court in Manhattan and indications are that the government's first witness will be an informer who worked for the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden until 1996, when he agreed to cooperate with the American authorities.","2000":"In Pakistan, the thinking goes, the United States cannot afford a war between India and Pakistan that would jeopardize the hunt for Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda leaders who may have fled into Pakistan; so the Americans will press India to settle for a tough diplomatic strategy.","2001":"THE PRISONERS -- The four terrorists convicted of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa have been moved to the most secure federal prison in the country, the so-called Super Max in Florence, Colo.

And if ordinary Americans are frustrated, imagine the anguish of the nation's medical detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, caught flat-footed time and again.","2005":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 25\u2014 As the hunt for Osama bin Laden continues on both sides of the border between Afghanistan's Tora Bora district and the adjacent tribal regions of Pakistan, a succession of speculative and unsubstantiated reports have surfaced suggesting that the Qaeda leader may already be dead as a result of American bombing or even illness.","2006":"REPORTS OF BIN LADEN'S DEATH -- As the search for the Qaeda leader continues, unsubstantiated reports about Osama bin Laden's possible death are flourishing. Officials and news organizations in the Pakistan, the United States and Afghanistan have speculated that bin Laden might have been killed in bombing at Tora Bora or by long-standing illness. B3","2008":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 25\u2014 The thousands of American troops in the region supporting the drive to find Osama bin Laden were on a high state of alert today, but spent the Christmas holiday without airstrikes or ground engagements, according to military officials in Washington and at the Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla.","2009":"Mr. Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, has been accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terror network, and federal law enforcement officials suspect that Mr. Moussaoui would have been the 20th hijacker on Sept. 11 if he had not been arrested on immigration charges in August.","2010":"But Pakistan had hardly been expected to deal with Maulana Azhar as lightly as it appeared to have done on Sunday, according to reports in Pakistan today. Hamid Mir, a Pakistani editor with close links to Osama bin Laden, said the Jaish leader had told him that he was picked up by Pakistani police for questioning, then released. --------------------","2011":"Washington's Hitlerization of Mullah Omar mistakenly conflates him with Osama bin Laden, the real villain. Mr. bin Laden is a master terrorist, while Mullah Omar is a two-bit tyrant. Mullah Omar gave refuge to Mr. bin Laden and free use of his country, and all this helped Al Qaeda and the cause of terrorism. But no evidence has emerged that Mullah Omar himself engaged in international terrorism or even knew anything about it, and he is so unworldly that it is difficult to imagine him having a clue how Al Qaeda operated.","2012":"It would be nice to see the leaders of Pakistan and India act with the same good judgment. As Indian forces have cracked down on an uprising in disputed Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state, Pakistan has too freely permitted groups operating on its soil to send forces into Kashmir to support the rebellion. Gen. Pervez Musharraf is only the latest Pakistani leader to call these warriors 'freedom fighters' over whom he has little control. In fact, there is every reason to believe that Pakistani military and intelligence forces encourage and even direct these groups, just as Pakistan aided the Taliban and Osama bin Laden before Sept. 11.","2014":"Al Qaeda is now said to control at least 20 ships, and American officials have been concerned that Osama bin Laden might use them to escape.","2015":"The hunt for Osama bin Laden continues, and the mystery of his whereabouts deepens. Al Jazeera, the Persian Gulf television network that has been the conduit for Mr. bin Laden's messages in the past, broadcast part of a 30-minute recording purported to have been made sometime in late November or early December.","2016":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 26\u2014 The United States military is revising a risky plan for American troops to search the caves of Tora Bora for traces of Osama bin Laden and other fighters of Al Qaeda, and is offering incentives to get Afghan forces to take the lead, American officials said today.","2017":"State Department officials said they believed that Lashkar-e-Taiba had links to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization, and that Mr. bin Laden had provided financial support to the group.","2018":"12. At year's end Osama bin Laden will be (a) still at large, assumed but only half-believed dead; (b) captured, convicted and executed after overseas trial by U.S. military tribunal; (c) standing criminal trial in regular U.S. judicial system.","2019":"The rally lost steam before the closing bell, however, after reports that al Jazeera broadcast a videotape showing Osama bin Laden making new comments on the attacks he is suspected of masterminding.","202":"The need for extra vigilance should not be underestimated, given the brutal nature of the crimes and the breadth of the conspiracy outlined by the government. Two of the defendants are charged with directly assisting in the embassy bombings, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 4,000. The other two are accused more broadly of involvement in a global conspiracy spanning Asia and Africa that prosecutors say is directed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile now believed to be living in Afghanistan. In their opening statement to the jury yesterday, prosecutors linked the conspiracy to the 1993 ambush of American troops in Somalia in which 18 soldiers died.","2020":"SEARCH IS ALTERED -- The United States military has revised a risky plan for American troops to search the caves of Tora Bora for traces of Osama bin Laden and other fighters of Al Qaeda, and is once again urging local forces to take the lead. Just last Friday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he was ordering hundreds more American troops to join Afghan militia in the hunt. A1","2021":"He said it suggested the possibility that Al Qaeda, the network of Osama bin Laden, could have had something to do with Saturday's event. 'Would it be wrong to think there was a connection?' Mr. Bakr said. 'I don't know that there was, but it would be wrong not to consider it.'","2022":"The result: for Osama bin Laden's most audacious strike against the United States, Europe was his forward base, Saudi Arabia his pool of recruits, the United States a vulnerable target.","2023":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 26\u2014 A new videotaped statement from Osama bin Laden that purports to have been made sometime in late November or early December shows the terrorist leader looking tired and gaunt but alive some three months after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","2024":"The major TV news networks gave Osama bin Laden's latest message significant weight yesterday, even though most of what he said was not really new.","2025":"Yet a dictator who managed to win a war and rule his country with an iron hand could not be anything like an unworldly monk. He had plenty of time to hand over Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, to avoid the war and to stay in power. But he chose to defend Osama bin Laden.","2026":"I agree with Nicholas D. Kristof's proposal to let Mullah Muhammad Omar get away (column, Dec. 26). The more I hear about Mullah Omar's relationship with Osama bin Laden, the more I conclude that Osama bin Laden was merely using Mullah Omar.","2027":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Within hours of the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush said, 'We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.' From that first statement, Mr. Bush shaped a grand strategy for the war on terrorism that is as transforming of American policy as was Ronald Reagan's pledge to consign an 'evil empire' to the 'ash heap of history.' It breaks with the past by taking aim at states harboring terrorists as well as at terrorists themselves. It is why we have destroyed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan even as we hunt down Osama bin Laden himself. It is why the war against terrorism cannot be won if Saddam Hussein continues to rule Iraq.","2028":"THE MANHUNT -- An Afghan defense official said Osama bin Laden had escaped the country and was hiding in the mountainous border region of Pakistan. The Pentagon dismissed the report but said it had no idea of his whereabouts. A1","2029":"More than 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11. Mullah Muhammad Omar allowed Osama bin Laden to use his country to plan these killings.","203":"In its opening statement, the government suggested that the bombings had been masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban, which rules the country, and carried out by members of his group, Al Qaeda.","2030":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 27\u2014 An Afghan defense official said tonight that Osama bin Laden had escaped the country and was hiding in the mountainous border region of Pakistan. The Pentagon dismissed the report but said it had no idea of his whereabouts.","2031":"Mr. Loiseau's frozen body, found in a rumpled heap in the rocky pass that might, in better weather, have led him from the mountain fortress crushed by B-52's to safety or imprisonment in Pakistan, was the proof of something the French have suspected all along: that young French Muslims have been fighting by the side of Osama bin Laden in 'the Foreign Legion of Al Qaeda.'","2032":"Of course, one can't help sympathizing with India. Nobody deserves having a prickly and unstable country like Pakistan next door. Pakistan's intelligence service killed more people in terrorist incidents over the years than Osama bin Laden did.","2033":"PARIS\u2014 Late last July in Afghanistan, after months of terrorist training, Jamal Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman, was summoned to the home of a senior aide to Osama bin Laden.","2034":"BIN LADEN'S WHEREABOUTS -- As criticism of the American bombing grows in Afghanistan, an Afghan defense official added a twist to the search for Osama bin Laden by saying the terrorist leader had escaped into Pakistan. The official said Mr. bin Laden was under protection of the fundamentalist Jamiat-e-Ulema-i-Islam party, which has supported Islamic extremists for a decade.","2035":"But hearsay and other kinds of evidence that would typically be excluded in civilian trials would be allowed at the tribunals. The standard the regulations provide would allow the military judges to consider any evidence that 'a reasonable person' would find useful. That means that evidence like the videotape of Osama bin Laden boasting of the Sept. 11 attacks and any intelligence interceptions would be admissible.","2036":"Following are excerpts from the most recent videotape by Osama bin Laden, as translated by Agence France-Presse. Additional excerpts are available on the Web at nytimes.com/world.","2037":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 27\u2014 Osama bin Laden's latest videotaped statement was delivered to an Arab television network two days ago from Pakistan by the DHL express package company, in an apparent break with the terrorist leader's past practices of using personal couriers to deliver messages to the outside world, according to a network executive and American officials.","2039":"But what about Mr. Walker's prior actions in the training camps, financed by Osama bin Laden, where non-Afghan members of the Taliban learned how to use explosives and poisons? Because the law was not changed until October, his prior actions would not have been in violation of it. The Constitution prohibits punishing people for acts which, at the time they were committed, were not illegal.","204":"A secret government witness, Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, emerged to tell a hushed federal courtroom in Manhattan how he helped the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden move money and arms to terrorist groups in Africa and the Middle East as part of a conspiracy aimed at the United States. He testified in the trial of four men accused in the embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A1","2040":"But these days, Mr. Push is embracing television to the point where just about anybody who watches cable news regularly has seen him, whether he is reacting to Osama bin Laden's so-called home video or calling for more financial support for families of the terror attack victims.","2041":"But the American strategy also had a decided drawback: the decision to let proxy forces bear the brunt of the ground fighting may have allowed many Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, and possibly Osama bin Laden himself, to escape.","2042":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 28\u2014 Speculation intensified today over the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, when Pakistan rebutted an assertion by Afghanistan's defense minister that Mr. bin Laden was in Peshawar, just inside Pakistan.","2043":"ONLY ONE DRAWBACK -- The novel strategy adopted by the United States in Afghanistan -- have American commandos organize the Afghan resistance and direct punishing air strikes -- was a striking success. It toppled the Taliban, led to the installation of a friendly government and ensured that Al Qaeda could no longer use Afghanistan as a base for terrorism. But it had one drawback: the decision to let proxy forces bear the brunt of the ground fighting may have allowed many Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, possibly Osama bin Laden himself, to escape, thus denying the United States one of its chief goals -- bringing Mr. bin Laden to justice. A1","2044":"Mr. Bush said again today that the United States would bring Osama bin Laden to justice either 'dead or alive.' The president conceded that he did not know Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts, including whether he had escaped to Pakistan or 'whether he's in a cave with the door shut or a cave with the door open.'","2045":"Q. Can you say with confidence now that Osama bin Laden is no longer in a position to mastermind another terrorist attack against the United States or our allies? And related to that, you've talked about 2002 being a year of war. What can you say to prepare the American people for, as compared to what they've seen in Afghanistan?","2046":"After 12 weeks, the war in Afghanistan seems nearly over. With the Taliban gone, Al Qaeda cut to ribbons and Osama bin Laden dead or on the run, Kabul's interim government signaled that it wanted American bombing halted soon and the fight against terrorism moved elsewhere. But matters are not quite that simple.","2047":"AL QAEDA -- The rumors regarding Osama bin Laden had him dead of natural causes, dead in a Tora Bora cave, alive under the protection of a religious leader in Pakistan and alive and hiding in the mountainous area just west of the Afghanistan border. Al Jazeera, the Arab television channel, broadcast a tape of a gaunt Mr. bin Laden, accusing the West of a campaign against Islam and praising the Sept. 11 attacks in language that places the taping in late November or early December.","2048":"Despite the success of the United States in bringing down the Taliban and Al Qaeda, it has failed so far in capturing the organizations' leaders, Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.","2049":"THE RESPONSE -- An extensive review of the nation's antiterrorism efforts shows that years before Sept. 11, terror experts in the government understood the apocalyptic designs of Osama bin Laden but never acted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be. Dozens of interviews with current and former officials show that even as the threat of terrorism mounted, the government did not marshal its full forces against it. A1","205":"A secret government witness emerged yesterday to tell a hushed federal courtroom in Manhattan how he helped the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden move money and arms to terrorist groups in Africa and the Middle East as part of a conspiracy aimed at the United States.","2050":"It took awhile to unlearn the number 6,000. Though the estimated death toll at the World Trade Center has been falling steadily since early October -- and has by now shrunk by half -- the smaller number proved hard to absorb. As late as Thanksgiving, the larger figure was still being cited by disc jockeys and pundits, by Northern Alliance fighters and admirers of Osama bin Laden. Maybe even now it remains embedded in the minds of Americans who have been paying less avid attention to the news than they did in September. And of those fully aware of the revised number, many seemed reluctant to adopt it. When lower death estimates were first reported, few Americans were in the mood for revisionism, even of the most benign and understandable sort. Nobody wanted to insert the word 'only' in front of a new tally of the dead. Body counts often become a proxy measure of a tragic event's significance; as the historian Karel Bartosek has written, they are 'a mathematical truth' that 'transforms mass deaths into a kind of sacrament.' Viewed in this light, insisting on precise new estimates can seem morally obtuse, beside the point. Lowering the body count can -- perversely, irrationally -- feel like a sad thing, as if it were an exercise in diminishing the weight of Sept. 11.","2051":"An extensive review of the nation's antiterrorism efforts shows that for years before Sept. 11, terror experts throughout the government understood the apocalyptic designs of Osama bin Laden. But the top leaders never reacted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be that morning.","2052":"It would be easy to go on about the things Mr. Giuliani failed to do -- New York City has so many problems and crises and needs that all mayors leave office with far more losses than wins. The most its residents can expect of a mayor is that he -- or someday she -- accomplish one big thing, as Mayor Koch did in restoring the city's financial health. If that one achievement is important enough, it will come to stand for everything. When measured in that way, Mr. Giuliani more than did the job. He restored New Yorkers' confidence in their ability to control the city's destiny. The long years he spent fighting crime and disorder became the platform from which he showed us how to fight terrorism and Osama bin Laden.","2053":"Discussions about the roots of Christianity and Islam; the meaning of the peace testimony, or what non-Quakers understand as the pacifist position; and whether Osama bin Laden should be killed were addressed at the Wilton Friends First Day school in Connecticut, said Jennifer Christensen, a South Salem resident who teaches there.","2054":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 29\u2014 The American-backed effort to comb the caves of Tora Bora for signs of Osama bin Laden, his fighters and intelligence on terrorist attacks that might be in the works has made little progress and seems to be fading as a top priority, American and Afghan officials said today.","2056":"The military intelligence officers added what amounted to a warning to the United States. Unless Washington can persuade India to reverse its buildup quickly, they said, Pakistan will be forced to augment its own reinforcements on the border by recalling troops from its western border with Afghanistan, where they are hunting for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda terrorists.","2057":"It is unlikely that President Bush anticipated anything like this when he went before Congress on Sept. 20 and issued his ultimatum to the rulers of the land from which Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda had directed the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 'The Taliban must act and act immediately,' he declared then. 'They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.'","2058":"Clutched in the ground where the World Trade Center once stood are the physical remains of thousands of people. Memorials and funerals have proceeded without coffins, or in some chapels, with empty ones, and in one awful case, with the wrong body. Osama bin Laden may be dead and undiscovered, like the thousands whose killings he is believed to have organized. Or he may be undead and on the run along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan.","2059":"Osama bin Laden Video Series","206":"The United States, which under the Clinton administration led a campaign in the United Nations to impose sanctions on the Taliban for their refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy, said today that it would fly relief goods to the battered country.","2060":"Retaliation came in two forms, economic and military, as the administration froze the assets of groups and individuals it accused of bankrolling the attackers. The Pentagon sent regular troops and special forces to Afghanistan to topple the Taliban leadership and find Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, the network that Washington blamed for the attacks. But the Pentagon moved into an endgame strategy with Mr. bin Laden still at large and administration officials debating whether to take the war on terrorism to Iraq and drive President Saddam Hussein from power.","2061":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 30\u2014 Representatives of Osama bin Laden contacted Iranian intelligence agents in the mid-1990's in an attempt to forge an anti-American alliance of terror between Iran and Mr. bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, according to United States intelligence reports.","2062":"The Tirah Valley is at the foot of one of the main escape routes, and if Osama bin Laden has chosen this as his refuge, he has selected a beautiful spot.","2063":"Again there was talk, but no word, on Osama bin Laden, who has gloated on tape about killing Americans. Afghanistan's foreign minister said that Mr. bin Laden might still be in the country. Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said that he was probably still alive, maybe in Pakistan. Pakistan's foreign minister denied that, but said that if he turned up he'd be handed over to America.","2064":"AL QAEDA AND IRAN -- Representatives of Osama bin Laden contacted Iranian intelligence agents in the mid-1990's in an attempt to forge an anti-American alliance of terror between Iran and Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, according to United States intelligence reports obtained by The Times.

But for the moment, the Pentagon seems prepared to let a dwindling number of Afghan soldiers do that work.","2068":"Osama bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in 1996, with the Americans already regarding him as a stateless sponsor of terrorism. Over the years he exerted ever greater influence over the Taliban. Afghanistan became a training ground for terrorists.","2069":"At 6 p.m., organizers held a special citywide bell-ringing ceremony, as the New Year's ball was raised above 1 Times Square. And whenever Osama bin Laden appeared on a nationally televised program on a big-screen monitor in Times Square, a chorus of boos ensued.","2070":"They will find quite a mix of people among the foreign prisoners who came to fight for the Taliban or for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda movement. Their individual stories indicate that it was not so much a grand design that brought them together as the simple and broad appeal that Afghanistan under the Taliban and militant Islam held for young Muslims around the world.","2071":"Mr. Bush also repeated today that Osama bin Laden would be found, even though American and Afghan officials say his trail has grown cold. 'We're going to get him and it's just a matter of time,' Mr. Bush said.","2072":"The anti-Taliban forces here have preferred negotiations over fighting with the Taliban, since members of both sides come from the same Pashtun ethnic group. As in Tora Bora, where Afghans showed little interest in searching for Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members, Americans might face the same difficulties in Baghran in their pursuit of Mullah Omar.","2073":"Baghdad, which is on a United States list of states sponsoring terrorism, has denied any link to the Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden, whom Washington accuses of planning the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","2074":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 1\u2014 Zacarias Moussaoui, the first man to be indicted on charges involving the Sept. 11 attacks, is scheduled to be in court on Wednesday to enter a plea on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and others to murder thousands of people.","2075":"TEHRAN, Jan. 1\u2014 Iran has denied a report that it had contacts with members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, newspapers reported today.","2076":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 1\u2014 Senior officials said today that Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, had ordered the country's military intelligence agency to cut off backing for Islamic militant groups fighting in the disputed territory of Kashmir. They said future support would go only to groups with local roots that are not part of the Islamic holy war movement that has its most notorious expression in Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda.","2077":"The mission in Baghran, however, suggests diverging interests between the Americans and Afghans. As President Bush indicated on Monday, capturing Mullah Omar remains a priority for the United States, particularly since the trail of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, appears to have grown cold. The Pentagon has drawn criticism for not having posted American ground troops in the Tora Bora region to prevent Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters from fleeing.","2078":"All hail to President Bush for how he has conducted the war against Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush has emerged a far better commander in chief than anyone predicted. In the war on terrorism he has shown steely resolve, imagination, leadership and creativity. Thank you, Mr. Bush.","2079":"It's all too easy now, months after the horror of Sept. 11 and years after earlier terrorist strikes against Americans, to say what major military actions the Clinton administration might have taken against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","208":"Yesterday, the man, Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, recounted the conversation in Federal District Court in Manhattan, telling a jury what had driven him into the hands of the Americans, a decision that involved an even more difficult step: betraying his leader, Osama bin Laden.","2080":"So here is our proposal, Mr. President. We issue a formal invitation to Osama bin Laden to come to Somalia, on behalf of a fictitious warlord in some nearby town -- say, Gialalassi. Then we will announce a few sightings.","2082":"The two sites calculate statistics differently and Google has a more international flavor, yet both counted Britney Spears, Osama bin Laden, Nostradamus, Harry Potter and Anna Kournikova among the dominant personalities. Both chronicled the rise of Morpheus, the music-file sharing service, at the expense of Napster. And both found reality television dominating the television-related queries.","2083":"But there is no credible evidence that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the Sept. 11 attacks. There is no credible evidence that he has collaborated with Osama bin Laden in any of the Qaeda leader's nefarious projects.","2085":"In his statement, Mr. Mandela also questions the 'labeling of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist responsible for those acts before he has been tried and convicted,' a step that 'could also be seen as undermining some of the basic tenets of the rule of law.'","2086":"From the wide-ranging scope of the arguments today, it seems evident that the trial will provide the government with its best opportunity so far to lay out its evidence against those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and to present its full case against Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorists.","2087":"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Jan. 2\u2014 About 200 United States marines returned to their base at the Kandahar airport today after sweeping through a deserted terrorist training camp in southern Afghanistan where they recovered only small numbers of weapons and few documents belonging to Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda.","2088":"India is understandably skeptical of Pakistan's actions. It should recognize, however, that General Musharraf has already done more than many would have thought possible only a few months ago. After the Sept. 11 attacks he turned Pakistan away from its support of the Taliban in Afghanistan and has assisted in the drive to crush Al Qaeda and find Osama bin Laden. General Musharraf took those actions because of a promise of American aid and what may have been a separate promise not to install an anti-Pakistan regime in Kabul. But unlike the Taliban, the Kashmiri uprising is widely seen in Pakistan as a worthy cause, dear to many hearts. There is a chance that General Musharraf's about-face will cause elements of the armed forces and large sectors of the Islamic clergy to turn against him.","2089":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 3\u2014 Pakistani officials said today that they had arrested the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, and that he was being questioned by Pakistani and American intelligence officials seeking information on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden as well as Mullah Muhammad Omar, the former Taliban leader.","209":"On other topics, Mr. Tenet reaffirmed the Central Intelligence Agency's belief that the nature and structure of anti-American terrorism had radically changed over the last few years and was now dominated by independent and decentralized groups like that of Osama bin Laden. The United States has said Mr. bin Laden and his group, al-Qaeda, were behind the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998, as well as other anti-American terrorist attacks.","2090":"Senior Pentagon officials said a large number of non-Afghan fighters of the Qaeda military corps -- possibly including some senior commanders -- had been spotted at the camp, which was the target of a 1998 American cruise missile attack that was intended to kill Osama bin Laden.

But it was Mr. bin Laden's network that brought about the Sept. 11 attacks, and his agents did not come from Iraq. There is no credible public information to indicate that Iraq was significantly involved.","2093":"Mr. Karzai has shown impressive political skills while reaching out to disparate factions in shaping his government. Washington's first political priority is to shore up his authority so that Afghanistan can have a stable government that extends from one end of the country to the other. But that objective is complicated by the overriding American military priority of pursuing, capturing or killing the remaining Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, particularly Osama bin Laden.","2094":"Inside Afghanistan, the general said, American military teams have searched 40 of 48 suspected weapons-production sites, but have found no hard evidence that Osama bin Laden and his forces developed any chemical, radiological or biological arms.","2095":"As allied forces narrow their hunt for Osama bin Laden, the broader mission is creating a stable, secure Afghanistan. That will take time and resources, but President Bush can start now by drawing on one of the most effective, cost-efficient weapons in the fight against poverty: providing very small business loans to the poorest people -- especially women -- through microlending.","2096":"In Afghanistan, the United States Army is embarked on a long mission to register the prisoners and interrogate those who may be able to provide valuable information about Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorist network. Eighty-five of the prisoners in Shibarghan had been sent to the American base in Kandahar by Tuesday, Colonel Wilkerson said, but he could not say what would happen to them after that. Senior defense officials in Washington have said a new prison camp is being built at the naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, to hold senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members.","2097":"How fleeting is infamy, after all. Osama bin Laden didn't make it as Time's Man of the Year, the Taliban have been routed, been there, done that. We can take solace in the fact that there has been no major follow-up terrorist attack since Sept. 11 and so pursue cut-rate security at a leisurely pace -- all the while forgetting another part of pre-Sept. 11 history, namely that the typical interval between Al Qaeda actions is 12 to 24 months. Contrast the $8.3 billion that Congress has appropriated to domestic security with its latest 'absolute insanity' (in the words of John McCain) -- a dubious $22 billion slab of corporate pork that it bestowed upon Boeing in the form of an Air Force contract to lease 100 new wide-body jets that might be cheaper to buy outright. You can see how much our national priorities have changed since the day the world changed.","2098":"In his speech in California and at a question-and-answer session today where he roamed the stage, Mr. Bush previewed his political strategy for the coming months -- a blend of counterterrorism and counter-Daschleism. He began with an account of America's military successes in Afghanistan, mentioning Osama bin Laden once in passing. Then Mr. Bush wove to the need to back up military success with the adoption of his economic strategy.","2099":"The United States has taken custody of Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, one of Osama bin Laden's top paramilitary trainers and the most senior Al Qaeda member seized in the war in Afghanistan, American officials said. 1","210":"The trial of four men in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa began in New York with prosecutors calling as their first witness a Sudanese man who served as a close aide to Osama bin Laden and described the inner workings of his group, Al Qaeda. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been indicted in the case, is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, but his presence is likely to be felt constantly during the trial, as prosecutors build a case that he led a broad terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans, which included the embassy attacks. Benjamin Weiser","2100":"In a culture that has demonstrated marked suspicion of the intellectual and always admired the frontier, with its images of eternal promise, Mr. Bush's language of the wild West, of wanting Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive,' has been derided by academics even as it was embraced by the public. Mr. Bush's first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, in November, was similarly direct, free of the usual diplomatic niceties and was praised at home, even as leaders of other nations called it blunt and U.S.-centric.","2102":"AL QAEDA -- The hunt for Osama bin Laden appears to have lost some urgency, after searches of hundreds of caves in Tora Bora yielded little information. But for two days in a row, American warplanes bombed a former Al Qaeda camp in Khost province that was the target of cruise missiles intended to kill Mr. bin Laden in 1998. Pentagon officials said Al Qaeda has been regrouping in the camp, which has been struck repeatedly in the past few months.","2103":"Michael Mullen of Old Lyme discovered the fliers when he went out to his driveway where his 10-year-old son was playing basketball. He said he stopped reading the flier after he saw the picture of Osama bin Laden, the burning World Trade Center and the headline 'Let's Stop Being Human Shields for Israel.' Some residents questioned why the group thinks it will gain support by trying to justify the terrorist attacks.","2104":"And then there is that other world where Osama bin Laden is loved and lauded, where Osama is a favored name for newborn sons and where children play Osama eluding the evil forces of America. These photographs, taken last month, show a world where Mr. bin Laden has also become a marketing tool -- for cologne in Pakistan, for a box of sweets in Afghanistan -- and where hawkers do roaring trade in Osama T-shirts and Osama posters and Osama key-rings.","2105":"Following existing precedents, an ad hoc international criminal court could quickly be established by the United Nations Security Council to try Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders for crimes against humanity. No security secrets need be revealed to justify convictions. Lesser offenders can face national tribunals or summary proceedings, as was done after World War II. The permanent international criminal court soon to be established offers a good model.","2106":"President Bush has warned us that the war on terrorism will be a long struggle. But how will we know when we've won even round one? Simple. We will have won round one once we've killed Osama bin Laden and his allies and once the leaders of the Arab-Muslim world have killed his ideas. That's the division of labor: we have to eliminate the killers and they have to delegitimate his ideas. I fear, though, that we'll do our part, but Arab-Muslim leaders won't do theirs. And if that's how round one ends, then on your next flight keep an eye on the tennis shoes of the guy next to you.","2107":"NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 5\u2014 One of Somalia's warlords sent an urgent letter to President Bush shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States telling him that there were terrorists in Somalia sympathetic to Osama bin Laden.","2108":"If Mullah Omar is no longer in Baghran, it would be another blow to the United States, which has so far failed in one of its central goals of the war: capturing the leader of the Taliban and the leader of the Qaeda terrorist network, Osama bin Laden. On Monday, President Bush re-emphasized that seizing Mullah Omar remained a priority and expressed confidence that he would be found.","2109":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5\u2014 The United States has taken custody of one of Osama bin Laden's top paramilitary trainers, the most senior member of Al Qaeda seized in the three-month war in Afghanistan, American officials said today.","211":"The militant Islamic government, which controls most of the country, has been under Security Council sanctions for not turning over to the United States Osama bin Laden, who is believed to finance terrorism, and has been criticized widely for its human rights record.","2110":"Her office also first indicted Osama bin Laden in 1998, and there are five men in custody in New York and Britain who are still expected to be tried in Manhattan on charges that they conspired in terrorism with Mr. bin Laden.","2111":"Singapore has arrested 15 Muslims and accused them of planning to blow up military targets and embassies in the small city-state. The government said at least some of them might have received training from Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al Qaeda. The government said the men had been found with bomb-making instructions, and with photographs and videotape of buildings that were apparently being considered as targets. A8","2112":"Quake III is an easy mark for such efforts. The developers of the two-year-old game have made its underlying computer code freely available, hoping that player-built tweaks will extend its lifespan. Visitors to the PlanetQuake.com site learn that the game's futuristic settings can be replaced with, for instance, a Wild West theme. Predictably, after Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden became a popular target in several games.","2113":"'The evil one': Mr. Bush has regularly used this phrase to describe Osama bin Laden. Among evangelical Christians, it is an obvious reference to Satan, and appears throughout the Bible. (From Matthew, in the New American Standard Bible: 'When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart.')","2114":"TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 6\u2014 A teenage pilot's fatal flight into a downtown skyscraper here was a deliberate gesture of support for Osama bin Laden and the hijackers who brought down the World Trade Center, the city's police chief said today.","2115":"A 15-year-old pilot's crash into a skyscraper in Tampa, Fla., on Saturday was a gesture of support for Osama bin Laden and the hijackers who brought down the World Trade Center, according to police officials, who said they had found a suicide note in the pocket of the youth, Charles J. Bishop. The White House said the incident did not appear to be a terrorist act.","2116":"Though Mr. Sharon has compared Mr. Arafat to Osama bin Laden in the past, he has not before publicly declared him to be an enemy, Israeli officials said. Still, his forceful declaration today appeared to have no immediate implications for policy. Israel continues to say it will not try to kill Mr. Arafat.","2117":"In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Turkey gained new importance to the coalition against Osama bin Laden, and for all its flaws on human rights, Turkey is a stable synthesis of democracy and Islam in a volatile Islamic world. Many regard it as a model for moderate Muslims and a counterweight to the angry voices of radicals.","2118":"TOKYO\u2014 There's just one thing that most Americans and Osama bin Laden seem able to agree on: that the attacks on the World Trade Center arose somehow from Islam. Whether the purest form of Islam or the most perverted, it so enveloped the hijackers in religious zeal that the centrality of Islam to the attacks is hard to deny.","2119":"Ms. White's remarks came in a wide-ranging interview on Saturday, and included some of her most revealing public comments about Osama bin Laden and terrorism.","212":"Prosecutors called a shadowy figure to the stand who was once a close aide to Osama bin Laden, the man the government believes was the mastermind behind the bombings. The witness, a convicted terrorist named Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, gave the jury an insider's look at Mr. bin Laden's world, recounting his support for other jihad groups, his justification for attacks against the United States and his attempt to buy uranium, possibly to make a nuclear weapon.","2120":"'If you're looking for Osama bin Laden terrorist cells, it's hard to find them when you go to church on Sunday,' Mr. Earnest gently advised, reflecting on his clandestine years of running cold-war agents in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. 'You have to fish where the fish are.'","2121":"In an age when we hold Mullah Muhammad Omar responsible for the presence of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, we should certainly hold Yasir Arafat responsible for the order of terrorist munitions.","2122":"Mr. Bishop, a freshman at East Lake High School, stole an airplane from a flight school at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport on Saturday and crashed it into the 28th floor of the Bank of America Plaza in downtown Tampa. A note expressing sympathy for Osama bin Laden was in his pocket.","2123":"Two world-renowned figures have been on the run, living in 'undisclosed locations' since Sept. 11. There are occasional sightings of both, but then they vanish. One figure is named Osama bin Laden. The other is named Dick Cheney.","2124":"Mr. Karzai added, however, that he had not asked the United States to curtail its bombing campaign while it pursues Osama bin Laden, the elusive head of Al Qaeda, or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader.","2125":"The two Al Qaeda fighters, who were seized by American Special Forces and Central Intelligence Agency paramilitary officers near the Zawar Kili training base in Khost Province, are not top lieutenants of Osama bin Laden, officials said.","2126":"From the first days of America's new war against international terrorism, President Bush has made clear that the use of United States military force would not necessarily end with the defeat of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan or the killing or capture of Osama bin Laden. He rightly warned governments around the world that offering sanctuary to international terrorists could expose their countries to American military attack. With Osama bin Laden and other top leaders of Al Qaeda now on the run from Afghanistan, Mr. Bush needs to initiate a discussion with Congress and the American people about whether the war should be extended to other lands.","2127":"The pundits predict that he will call at a Muslim country, and one of those often mentioned is Somalia. Apart from speculations, no one has the slightest idea what the spreaders of destruction and those in hot pursuit of them will do once Afghanistan has ostensibly rid herself of Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda associates. But the assumption is that in Somalia, a land of grief, these destructive forces would find a haven because there is no central authority to flush them out, hunt them down or bring them before a court.","2128":"Aiming his M-16 assault rifle at a fleeing Arab in white robes and a long beard, the American fired -- killing Osama bin Laden. A pool of blood spread from Mr. bin Laden's head as an elite Special Forces team stood over its vanquished quarry.","2129":"That ability to disappear is what worries United States officials, who continue to search for Osama bin Laden, the head of Al Qaeda, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban.","2130":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9\u2014 America's goals in Central Asia were easily explained as Kabul and Kandahar fell, when daily Pentagon videos showed bombs homing in on caves in Tora Bora and when there was a reasonable prospect that Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and their top aides would soon fall into American hands.","2131":"'Pakistan has not yet moved even a single soldier who is committed to duty alongside the Americans,' said a Pakistani military intelligence officer, disputing media reports that the search for Osama bin Laden and other fugitives had been crippled as the country mobilizes against India.","2132":"The governor was kicking off his own re-election campaign as much as a new season of the State Legislature. For a budgetary villain he resuscitated the era of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has been out of office for seven years. Mr. Pataki compared today's yawning state deficit, courtesy of Osama bin Laden and the recession, to the budget gaps left by Governor Cuomo in 1995. Unfair as that is, it is certainly a signal that it's election time again for Mr. Pataki.","2133":"A senior Pentagon officer said today that those forces have discovered that the fortified underground complex at Zhawar Kili was much larger than had previously been thought, perhaps 40 acres or more. Zhawar Kili was used by local Afghans fighting Soviet forces during the 1980's, and later became a major training base for Al Qaeda fighters under Osama bin Laden.","2134":"Continuing its assault on Osama bin Laden's financial network, the Bush administration announced yesterday that it was freezing assets of two groups professing humanitarian aims that officials said had funneled charitable donations to Al Qaeda instead.","2136":"BRUSSELS\u2014 Alive or dead, Osama bin Laden poses problems. If buried at the bottom of a bombed cave, we may not know his fate for some time. And while the world waits, Mr. bin Laden may become, among many Muslim militants, a modern-day version of a vanished imam, a lost spiritual guide whose hoped-for return will empower the oppressed and vanquish the strong.","2137":"East African leaders opened a summit meeting in Khartoum by urging united action against terrorists. The United States has in the past accused Sudan of helping to foster terrorism, and as it hunts Osama bin Laden, Washington has accused an Islamic group in Somalia of having links with Al Qaeda. The host of the meeting, President Omar al-Bashir, urged his colleagues to help 'shed the image' that Africa is a breeding ground for terrorists. Marc Lacey (NYT)","2138":"Senior French intelligence officials said the pattern of Mr. Reid's travels to more than half a dozen countries during the past year, his habit of paying for tickets and hotels in cash and his stint at a training camp in Afghanistan strongly suggested that he was a low-level courier for Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.","2139":"It said that the 13 suspects were members of a clandestine organization called the Islamic Group, and that 8 had received training in Afghanistan from Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden.","214":"But on Friday, the administration announced that it would close down the Taliban office in New York, the only presence the movement has in the United States. Denied Afghanistan's United Nations seat, the Taliban have used a small office in Queens to stay in touch with United Nations officials and with Washington, which is demanding that Afghanistan turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy.","2140":"Mr. Massoud was killed on Sept. 9, two days before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and American officials have said they believe he was murdered by Al Qaeda operatives sent by Osama bin Laden.","2141":"Fearful that a war could imperil the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, President Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain have been publicly pressuring Pakistan to crack down on extremist groups.","2142":"While some individual Nunn-Lugar programs have suffered from poor administration, their overall achievement has been undeniably impressive. For a total of less than $7 billion since 1991, Washington has helped finance not only the deactivation of more than 5,500 nuclear warheads from Russia and other former Soviet republics, but also the employment of Russian nuclear scientists who might otherwise have sold their services to Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden, as well as some badly needed tightening of security at Russian plutonium and bomb-grade uranium storage facilities. Nunn-Lugar money has also been used to begin dismantling Russia's biological weapons plants. Much more needs to be done, especially in the area of accounting for and protecting plutonium and uranium, which remain vulnerable to diversion or theft. Much of the increased funding the administration plans to request is rightly targeted at addressing this continuing danger.","2143":"These are the kinds of uncomfortable questions Jon Ronson raises in his often entertaining, more often disturbing, book 'Them.' Ronson, a writer and documentary filmmaker in Britain, insinuated himself into the homes and graces of a variety of conspiracy theorists and 'extremists,' whom he defines as those who 'have been called extremists by others.' The project began with Omar Bakri Mohammed, who is said to be Osama bin Laden's 'man in London.' Ronson went on to ingratiate himself with American Klansmen, neo-Nazis and the New World Order conspiracy theorists, some of whom he joins in the quest for the one 'secret room' where a conclave of rulers supposedly plots the conspiracies that control the world.","2144":"To the degree there has to be a villain, Osama bin Laden fits the bill in a way that makes it even more difficult for Democrats to pin the blame on Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans. So rather than attacking Mr. Bush as directly responsible for rising unemployment, Democrats are concentrating their attacks on Mr. Bush's role in the dissipation of the budget surplus.","2145":"NEWS flash: Osama bin Laden is still missing. Congress considers education package. Santa's reindeer are probably female.","2146":"AL QAEDA -- Still frustrated in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar and concerned that Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters might be trying to regroup, allied forces combed the area around Khost, along the Pakistan border. They repeatedly bombed a training camp at Zhawar Kili, where they found an astonishing 40-acre underground complex that raised concerns that other vast, unseen bulwarks may be sheltering fighters.","2148":"While the United States has not decided what role, if any, to play in a multinational peacekeeping force, it has been reluctant to commit troops to operations other than those aimed at capturing Osama bin Laden and destroying his network, Al Qaeda.","2149":"There is no reason to believe the current President Bush's approval scores will begin to slide. The war effort in Afghanistan is judged a success by most Americans, and the failure to capture Osama bin Laden is not likely to be held against Mr. Bush. If anything, Mr. bin Laden's elusiveness will serve to perpetuate public concerns about another terrorist attack, which in turn will sustain feelings of national unity and support for the president. The use of force in Somalia or Sudan would probably produce the same result.","215":"While terrorists may be known for exporting chaos and mayhem, the international group that prosecutors say is run by Osama bin Laden emerged last week in the first two days of testimony at the trial in the American Embassy bombings in East Africa as a sleek and highly organized outfit in fairly good corporate trim.","2150":"KABUL, Afghanistan\u2014 I've got good news and bad news from Afghanistan. The good news is that America doesn't need a lot to satisfy its basic security interest here, which is that this distant land never again be so uncontrolled that a tumor like Osama bin Laden can grow in its midst and then metastasize into the world and threaten us. We really don't need much to get that -- just a loose Afghan federal government, some basic police and army units, a functioning economy and a few institutions.","2151":"As the United States scours the world for terrorists who might be linked to Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network -- or might provide its members with refuge and support -- Abu Sayyaf has come under increasing suspicion.","2152":"These no-account accountants seem to forget that the 'p' in C.P.A. means 'public.' The Big Five are silent about Andersengate because they are eager to become the Big Four by carving up their competitor's carcass. That's why it's harder to find a major bean-counter willing to condemn publicly the failures of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. than to find a top Muslim cleric willing to criticize Osama bin Laden.","2153":"But just as we still stare helpless into our television screens, hoping for some glimpse of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, so this eager knight peers into fog, seeing only 'the huge snout of nothingness.'","2154":"American officials in Washington have previously said that a top official from the C.I.A. held secret talks with his Syrian counterparts about helping the United States investigate and uproot Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda.","2155":"On Friday, the government described the men -- whom it said it had arrested last month -- as members of a clandestine organization called the Islamic Group, with links to Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden.","2157":"General Musharraf's speech was the second critical turnabout for Pakistan since Sept. 11. The first came when, under American pressure, Pakistan ended its support of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Repudiating the Taliban and Osama bin Laden was widely supported throughout Pakistan. Ending support for Muslim guerrillas in the disputed Indian state of Kashmir may not be so popular. General Musharraf made a powerful case for it, saying that ending support for groups attacking civilians in India offered the best path toward changing Indian policy on Kashmir.","2158":"The purpose of the accords is to establish a stable government, which means ending direct supplies of money and arms to warlords. Yet the United States has been supporting various anti-Taliban commanders who are helping in the search for Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden. In the battle for Kandahar the United States came close to undermining Hamid Karzai, now head of the interim Kabul administration, by arming his local rivals. The immediate operational requirements of the battle against Al Qaeda and the Taliban have thus worked against the goal of consolidating the interim administration's authority.","2159":"While the American government does not want to become a mediator in the Kashmir dispute, it fears the consequences of a war between India and Pakistan, and does not want resources and attention diverted from its own global campaign to crush the terror network of Osama bin Laden.","216":"Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, a government witness who was once a close aide to Osama bin Laden, testified in the embassy bombings trial that he had proudly worked for Mr. bin Laden against the United States, but later acknowledged telling American agents that Mr. bin Laden 'misinterprets certain portions of the Koran to justify violent action.' B1","2160":"Even before today, Badr said, likenesses of Mr. Karmi outsold all his other offerings, most of which go for a little more than a dollar. The Palestinian Authority will not permit him to sell items showing Osama bin Laden, he said, but that does not much matter. 'People don't ask for bin Laden,' he said. 'They ask for Raed Karmi.'","2161":"Mr. Walker learned of the plans while completing a seven-week course in a Qaeda training camp. There, he met at least once with Osama bin Laden, who 'thanked him for taking part in jihad,' the affidavit said.","2162":"The Bush administration is doing the right thing by prosecuting John Walker in a civilian court rather than a military tribunal or a court-martial for his association with the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. The charges the government has brought against the young American, including conspiring to kill United States soldiers in Afghanistan and aiding a terrorist group, seem more appropriate than treason, which can bring a death sentence. Mr. Walker will face extremely serious charges that could be punished by life imprisonment. As the case proceeds, the Justice Department must ensure that he receives a fair trial.","2163":"If that becomes the case, does it make much difference if caps are sold on the sidewalk or in officially sanctioned stores? Indeed, given the crowds at ground zero, the vendors there make it considerably easier to outfit the world in N.Y.P.D and F.D.N.Y. caps. It's not as if they are selling Osama bin Laden dolls.","2164":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 15\u2014 Evidence of their link with Al Qaeda is sketchy: There were meetings some years ago with a brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, and some contact with one of the terrorists now imprisoned in the United States for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.","2165":"At a news conference today, Attorney General John Ashcroft said Mr. Walker had voluntarily told F.B.I. interviewers that he met Osama bin Laden in a small group and knew that Mr. bin Laden had ordered the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","2166":"Unfortunately, these aren't the only fighting roosters strutting around the Afghan ruins. There's also the human variety -- the Afghan warlords, and the neighboring powers that support them, who've been fighting over Afghanistan for two decades. The reason the Afghan war went so smoothly for the U.S. was because the geopolitical roosters -- Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia -- either overtly or tacitly cooperated with us to destroy the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, which was in each of their interests. And the local roosters -- the key Tajik, Pashtun, Hazara and Uzbek warlords -- did the same.","2167":"Or perhaps, some lawyers suggested, Mr. Walker will try a political defense, arguing, like Osama bin Laden, that his actions were justified by American behavior around the world.","2168":"These officials have become increasingly frustrated that American policy has been so focused on Osama bin Laden that it has not paid enough attention to other dangerous men like Mr. Mugniyah, who now has the same American price tag on his head as Mr. bin Laden -- $25 million.","2169":"But in a swath of eastern Afghanistan, where sympathies still generally favor the routed Taliban regime, American entreaties have often been greeted with cold stares and suspicion, officials said. The region is just south of Tora Bora, where hundreds of American and British commandos and Afghan militia searched fruitlessly vain for Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda fighters.","217":"Though Mr. Bush never used the phrase today, the movement he endorsed is known within the military establishment as the 'revolution in military affairs.' It takes many forms, but focuses on the development of new weapons, often designed to attack not only enemy states, but small groups of terrorists who, like Osama bin Laden, can pose a major threat to the United States and its allies.","2170":"*Reuel Marc Gerecht, a C.I.A. veteran in the Middle East who quit out of frustration, criticized agency officials for perpetrating the myth that America had an effective counterterrorism program against Osama bin Laden. In an article published last summer in The Atlantic Monthly, he argued that not a single C.I.A. officer had the skills and willingness to infiltrate bin Laden's operations in the mountains of Afghanistan. 'Operations that include diarrhea as a way of life don't happen,' a young C.I.A. case officer told him. Mr. Gerecht predicted that unless one of Osama bin Laden's 'foot soldiers walks through the door of a U.S. consulate or embassy, the odds that a C.I.A. counterterrorist officer will ever see one are extremely poor.' He criticized George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, for assuring the public that the C.I.A.'s efforts were keeping bin Laden's terrorists 'off-balance.'","2171":"On Sept. 11, 133 of our employees woke up and went to work, never to return home. Each of our companies was located in Two World Trade Center -- Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods on the 88th and 89th floors and Sandler O'Neill on the 104th floor. Our firms were among a group of companies with offices in the World Trade Center whose rosters of employees read like a Who's Who of the financial sector of the economy. They were exactly the kind of people Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda wanted to target. Their families are now dealing with both grief and enormous financial challenges.","2172":"Second, the war has led many Americans to feel that Saudi Arabia is not the best of allies. The Saudi regime -- undemocratic, an exporter of fundamentalism that is also hated by some of its own fundmentalists, like Osama bin Laden -- is important to the West because of its oil. Accordingly, to lessen Western dependence on Saudi (not to mention Iraqi) oil can only be to the good. The route to greater independence may well lead through Afghanistan.","2174":"Saudi Arabia first backed Islamic rebels battling Soviet occupation forces in the 1980's and then supported the Taliban from 1996. The Saudi government froze diplomatic ties with the Taliban in 1998 over the presence of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and severed relations completely two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","2175":"LONDON, Jan. 17\u2014 After months of investigation, the British authorities today charged two Algerian men arrested last September with membership in Osama bin Laden's terrorist network -- the first formal link drawn here between Al Qaeda and Islamic extremists alleged to be operating in this country.","2176":"It was the first time that a Filipino official had disclosed that Mr. Bush had offered American troops to fight on Philippine soil against the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, who have been linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. A White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, declined to comment on the report.","2177":"At a Justice Department news conference, Mr. Ashcroft said the statements were made on five hourlong videotapes found by American special forces in the rubble of a compound occupied by Muhammad Atef, one of Osama bin Laden's chief commanders. Military officials have said Mr. Atef was killed in an airstrike on Kabul in November.","2178":"While there is a long history of separatist unrest among Muslims in the southern Philippine islands, Abu Sayyaf is a fringe group with limited political support. Some of its 500 or so members appear at least loosely connected with Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda figures, and Abu Sayyaf is responsible for plenty of terrorism on its own. Its trademark is kidnapping, and it currently holds an American missionary couple.","2179":"President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan said in an interview published in Pakistani newspapers that Osama bin Laden might have died of kidney failure or in a bombing raid, or might still be hiding in Afghanistan. A8","218":"A former close aide to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden testified yesterday under cross-examination in the embassy bombings trial that he worked proudly for Mr. bin Laden in his war against the United States, but later acknowledged telling American agents that Mr. bin Laden 'misinterprets certain portions of the Koran to justify violent action.'","2180":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 18\u2014 President Pervez Musharraf said in an interview published here today that Osama bin Laden might have died of kidney failure in a cave in Afghanistan after becoming separated from a dialysis machine he had used in recent years.","2181":"In General Musharraf's meeting today, he tried to clarify reports that he had said Osama bin Laden was dead, saying he had no specific knowledge of his location or situation. His comments, he said, were based solely on his 'judgment and perception.' He said he was influenced by a Pakistani intelligence report that Mr. bin Laden had two kidney dialysis machines sent into Afghanistan, one for his personal use and the other for Afghans.","2182":"While refugees of every race, ethnicity and religion will be investigated, the government will focus on men who are 14 to 65 years old from countries where Al Qaeda, the terrorist group run by Osama bin Laden, has been operating, officials said.","2183":"In the push to rid the world of Osama bin Laden and his ilk, the role of men like Dr. Hishmet and the Brotherhood, the forebear of all Islamic groups, remains uncertain.","2184":"PHILADELPHIA\u2014 One consequence of Osama bin Laden's attack on America that was surely unintentional was turning Donald Rumsfeld into a folk hero. But strange things happen during wars, and televised press briefings have won the famously brusque secretary of defense a special place in the nation's heart. Last month a cover profile in U.S. News &amp; World Report called him 'the Pentagon's answer to Harry Truman' -- a 'straight-talking Midwesterner' who 'routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter.'","2185":"The incident provided material all week for late-night comics. 'All this time we're worried about Osama bin Laden,' Jay Leno cracked on Monday. 'It turns out he was almost done in by Mr. Salty.'","2188":"Across Afghanistan today, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters continued. American warplanes patrolled the skies, but there were no airstrikes overnight, officials said.","219":"An Egyptian-born flight instructor who worked freelance as Osama bin Laden's pilot said yesterday that he once helped the bin Laden organization buy a $200,000 decommissioned military jet in order to ship Stinger antiaircraft missiles from Pakistan to Sudan.","2190":"BEIJING, Jan. 21\u2014 Seeking to justify its harsh treatment of Muslims living in China's far western region of Xinjiang, Chinese officials asserted today that a small separatist movement there was being financed and supported by Osama bin Laden and that more than 100 terrorists who had trained at camps in Afghanistan had been arrested in China.","2191":"Yet, some of the city's elders are coming to believe, it is precisely that tolerance that may have provided Osama bin Laden's organization Al Qaeda with the cover to implant a secretive network here of Algerian militants that blended easily among Muslims of many backgrounds.","2192":"JAKARTA, Jan. 22\u2014 For the last two years, Osama bin Laden has been working to establish a beachhead here in the world's most-populous Muslim nation, say American and Asian officials. Members of his organization Al Qaeda have slipped in and out of the archipelago, bringing millions of dollars in cash for radical Islamic organizations, recruiting members, and providing military training, those officials say.","2193":"American and Asian officials say Osama bin Laden has been working to establish a beachhead in Indonesia, the world's most-populous Muslim nation. A1","2194":"On the way back from Kabul, I passed through Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, London and Belgium, where I had a variety of talks with Arab and Muslim journalists and business people and Muslim community leaders in Europe. All of them were educated, intelligent and thoughtful -- and virtually none of them believed that Osama bin Laden was guilty.","2195":"Among them, the officials said, was Abu Zubaydah, the operations chief for Al Qaeda, who was believed to be one of a handful of men entrusted with running the terrorism network in the event of Osama bin Laden's death or capture.","2196":"Some American officials are worried that Abu Sayyaf has links to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Five Islamic extremists have been arrested this month and a ton of explosives found.","2197":"By those criteria, Osama bin Laden should be at the head of the list. Mr. Posner's whole enterprise is worthless.","2198":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman ascribes Arab-Muslim sympathy for Osama bin Laden to a 'cultural resistance to believing anything good about America.' Mr. Friedman does not distinguish between American society and United States government actions around the world.","2199":"There still remains some Saudi popular support for Osama bin Laden -- and for his demand that 'infidel' American troops quit the birthplace of Islam. Although Saudi and American leaders have denied recent media reports that Saudi Arabia might soon ask American forces to leave, some of the 5,000 soldiers here harbor lingering security concerns.","22":"Ariana, Afghanistan's state-run airline, is under international sanctions and is not permitted to fly international routes. The United Nations imposed sanctions against the airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to extradite the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who reportedly has been living in Afghanistan for the last few years.","2200":"One of the first and most troubling questions to arise after Sept. 11 was whether Osama bin Laden represented a fanatical aberration of an otherwise humane and tolerant faith or whether he was the cutting edge of a dangerous and swelling sentiment in Islam. The question revealed a considerable ignorance about Islam in America and placed a high premium on those few with genuine expertise in the field.","2201":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 24\u2014 An Islamic cleric who was questioned here today by the police after Singapore and Malaysia demanded his arrest lauded Osama bin Laden as 'a true Islamic warrior' who had shown the courage and skill to fight the United States.","2202":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman cites some of the absurd conspiracy theories surfacing in the Muslim world holding that Osama bin Laden is not guilty of the Sept. 11 atrocities -- for example, that it was an American plot to smear the Saudis.","2203":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman says that in recent talks with a variety of Arab and Muslim journalists, business people and community leaders, he found 'virtually none' who believed that Osama bin Laden was guilty.","2204":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman ascribes Arab-Muslim sympathy for Osama bin Laden to a 'cultural resistance to believing anything good about America.' Mr. Friedman does not distinguish between American society and United States government actions around the world.","2205":"Hanging in the balance is the future of a young man who converted to Islam from Catholicism in 1997 at 16. While his advocates have portrayed his life as a spiritual quest, the complaint against him said that during questioning in Afghanistan Mr. Lindh said he had trained in explosives and firearms at a terrorist camp run by Al Qaeda, had fought shoulder to shoulder with the Taliban before he was captured, had met with Osama bin Laden and knew that Mr. bin Laden had ordered suicide attacks against the United States.","2206":"The federal judge who presided in the trial of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the terrorist convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, has been assigned the future trials in the 1998 embassy bombings conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden.","2207":"But even when he took the stand in his trial in November, the frail general, who wears a patch over one eye, described torture as useful and was unrepentant. 'My actions appeared justified,' he told the court, adding that he would do the same thing again today 'if it were against Osama bin Laden.'","2208":"The plot was foiled when 13 members were arrested. During questioning, officials say, they described a well-organized network stretching across Southeast Asia and perhaps into Australia. The early glimpses uncovered by authorities in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore suggest that the network rivaled in reach and sophistication the one formed by Osama bin Laden's lieutenants in Europe.","2209":"When Mr. Baer left Tajikistan in 1995, he was not replaced by someone with the necessary language skills to cultivate an agent close to the Islamic chieftain Abdullah Nuri, who fought the Russians in Afghanistan and subsequently arranged a meeting between Iranian officials and Osama bin Laden intended to plan anti-American acts.","221":"For now, Mr. Hussein may not even be America's most dangerous foe. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born extremist who is the FBI's most wanted terrorist suspect, has in recent years struck with more deadly effect at American interests, orchestrating the August 1998 bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa, and is suspected of being behind the bombing last October of the destroyer Cole in Yemen.","2210":"He said he saw Osama bin Laden come for frequent meetings with Mullah Omar. 'They had private meetings during the night and no one could go in,' he said. But he said that Mr. bin Laden's influence was not overwhelming. 'The head was Mullah Omar and he made the decisions,' the younger Mr. Hekmati said. 'He was not a good leader and not a good person. In all of the Taliban no one behaved as badly as he. I started to think how could we bring new people, who would know how to make our country prosper.'","2211":"In a wide-ranging interview, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz, the kingdom's director of the intelligence service, also acknowledged that after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the vast majority of Saudi young adults felt considerable sympathy for the cause of the Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Laden, even though they rejected the attacks in New York and Washington.","2213":"In the Muslim world, it seems that Osama bin Laden is now a fractured idol, and many Muslim scholars criticize him. Yet he also remains appealing to others, almost as a political Robin Hood.","2215":"Down the other side of the peaks is the cave-riddled region called Tora Bora, where the Americans bombed for weeks in pursuit of Osama bin Laden and sent hundreds of his Qaeda fighters fleeing. The soldiers here still hear the rumble of American warplanes, prowling Afghanistan's jagged border zone for remnants of enemy forces.","2216":"It was completed, one must emphasize, some time before Sept. 11. Scholars of international and Middle Eastern affairs like Lewis did not need Osama bin Laden's attacks, the subsequent war against the Taliban and revelations of our shaky, ambivalent friendships with Pakistan or Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to recognize that things were out of joint between the West and much of the Muslim world. What the events of the past few months did was to call this enormous problem to the attention of a far wider audience.","2217":"BRUSSELS\u2014 For all that has been written about Sept. 11, there is still one big hole in our knowledge: We know who Osama bin Laden is. He is a unique cult figure -- a Muslim Charles Manson with the organizational skills of Jack Welch. We also know who bin Laden's passive supporters are -- all those Muslims who sympathize with him out of anger with their own leaders, America or Israel. But who were the guys in the middle -- the killer pilots who went beyond passive support to become suicidal mass murderers?","2219":"Will he mention Osama bin Laden, even though Mr. Bush has still not made good on his vow to catch him 'dead or alive'? (Bush advisers said they would emphasize that there can be no wavering from the war on terrorism.)","222":"Mr. Saleh also reiterated in an interview with the Saudi-owned Middle East Broadcasting Corporation that there still is no evidence linking the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden to the Oct. 12 suicide bombing in the harbor of Aden, Yemen, that killed 17 American sailors.","2220":"The real problem is interrogation. If designated as P.O.W.'s, Al Qaeda men and Taliban leaders -- many of whom may be able to name other Osama bin Laden confederates already assigned to new attacks -- would be required only to state name, rank and serial number. They would then claim not only the right to remain silent, but also the right be freed when the 'war' ended -- despite active participation in a criminal conspiracy to kill civilians.","2221":"Ms. Belkacem said she never even saw her husband with a mobile phone: how then could he have made repeated cellular calls to one of Osama bin Laden's top aides after Sept. 11, as United States officials allege?","2222":"Mr. Karzai said his administration was assisting in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","2223":"'The Justice Department is reminding everyone that our terrorist threat goes beyond Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda,' a senior federal law enforcement official said. 'There are domestic threats as well. I think it's fair to say we'd like more of everything, from uniformed people on the ground to sniffer dogs to surveillance cameras.'","2224":"It would be unwise to alter our policy dramatically while the war on Al Qaeda continues. Indeed, a sharp change now might be seen as rewarding Osama bin Laden. But quietly, over time, the United States and Saudi Arabia should begin talks to reduce the American military presence, because our mutual interests will require that change.","2225":"Those strains were exposed more starkly when 15 of the 19 suspected hijackers were identified as Saudi citizens apparently wreaking terror at the behest of Osama bin Laden, who is Saudi-born but was stripped of his citizenship years ago.","2226":"A lawyer for a man suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden told a federal district judge in Manhattan yesterday that he wanted his client's trial moved from New York City because jurors may be prejudiced by the Sept. 11 terror attack on the World Trade Center.","2227":"A lawyer for Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who is suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden, told a federal judge that he wanted his client's trial moved from New York City because jurors might be prejudiced by the Sept. 11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. A14","2228":"If the address did not have the drama of Mr. Bush's Sept. 20 speech in the same House chamber, when an untried president vowed to unleash the nation's military might against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, it was still a marked change from the first major speech he made as president to Congress only 11 months ago.","2229":"The other widow was Renae Chapman, wife of Sgt. First Class Nathan R. Chapman of the Army's Special Forces. Sergeant Chapman was killed on Jan. 4 when his group was ambushed in Paktia province, near the border with Pakistan, as they tried to stitch together a local militia to hunt for Osama bin Laden and his Taliban ally, Mullah Muhammad Omar.","2230":"Earlier, Ms. Horan had worked at the F.B.I.'s Washington office heading counterterrorism investigations. She was placed in charge of the initial investigation into the East Africa embassy bombings in 1998, an inquiry that led to the conviction of several Al Qaeda followers of Osama bin Laden.","2231":"But there were subjects Mr. Bush avoided. He never uttered the name Osama bin Laden, who has eluded capture and remains the subject of an intense manhunt but is also a symbol of what remains incomplete in Mr. Bush's campaign in Afghanistan.","2232":"At the same time, the Afghan conflict seems to have confirmed Osama bin Laden as a folk hero.","2233":"This shift toward an elaboration on national character may help explain a major omission in the president's war talk: his failure to make any mention of Osama bin Laden, who planned the Sept. 11 attack but has yet to be captured. In many minds, the justification of the United States attacks on Afghanistan was retaliatory, exemplified by the president's vow to track down Mr. bin Laden. This is what Americans want, the yardstick they have identified for victory.","2235":"The apparent success of the Afghan campaign should not encourage Mr. Bush to overreach. As much of the world recognized, the attacks of Sept. 11 left the United States no choice but to defend itself, as it has done by dismantling the Taliban in Afghanistan and going after Osama bin Laden and his followers. There may well be circumstances that call for military action elsewhere in the months ahead, perhaps even pre-emptive strikes. Sept. 11, however, does not give Mr. Bush an unlimited hunting license. As a number of his predecessors learned to their and the nation's dismay, turning too quickly or too frequently to the use of force can cost a president support at home and damage American interests and alliances abroad.","2236":"President Bush's focus on the evildoers who must be sought (front page, Jan. 30) omits an important question that we have yet to engage: What United States policies, practices and institutions sustain the climate in which even criminals like Osama bin Laden find support and new recruits to replace those whom we are able to neutralize?","2237":"Also sought for questioning is a retired air force and intelligence officer named Khalid Khawaja, who had close ties with Sheik Gilani and Osama bin Laden, according to news media reports.","2238":"Most of the Sept. 11 hijackers and Osama bin Laden are from one particular country. It is insulting to this American that we have to depend on states like Saudi Arabia. We can do all kinds of things differently. This is war. Let us act as if we are in one.","2239":"So what is the lesson of this? Is it that while pretending to take the high road, we have actually slaughtered more people than Osama bin Laden has? Or that military responses are unjustifiable because huge numbers of innocents inevitably are killed?","2240":"Saudi Arabia's normally reticent leaders have made an unusual effort in recent days to air their views about the United States and its role in the Middle East. The openness itself is welcome and some of the comments have been heartening, including the desire to strengthen the friendship between Riyadh and Washington. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia's rulers remain reluctant to reckon with deformities in their own society that fuel the violent Islamic fundamentalism of Osama bin Laden and his followers.","2241":"In her decision, Judge Scheindlin also barred the government from introducing computer-generated photographs of Osama bin Laden found in Mr. Awadallah's apartment.","2242":"Mr. Berezovsky said his evidence 'is no less than the evidence the United States had that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the World Trade Center attack.'","2243":"'We are here to launch a round of exercises and training designed to enhance the capabilities of both of our armed forces and to help the armed forces of the Philippines hone their skills to eliminate the Abu Sayyaf scourge,' the acting American ambassador, Robert Fitts, said at the opening ceremony, referring to a Muslim separatist terrorist group that has been linked to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2244":"In a television interview Osama bin Laden gave in late October, he said the anthrax attacks last fall were 'a punishment from God' and hinted in vague language at having a hand in the Sept. 11 attacks.","2245":"Osama bin Laden, in an interview last fall that was brought to light only last night, said the anthrax attacks were 'a punishment from God' and, in vague language, seemed to hint at having a hand in them. A10","2247":"THE BUSH AGENDA -- In his State of the Union address, President Bush broadened his theme of national defense beyond antiterrorism. He pinpointed Iran, Iraq and North Korea, which are either known or believed to be developing biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, saying, 'states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil.' Terrorism remains a looming threat, he said, with Al Qaeda's trainees numbering tens of thousands, and with plans of American water supply systems and nuclear power plants among the documents unearthed in Afghanistan. He did not, however, mention two prominent fugitives: Osama bin Laden or Mullah Muhammad Omar.","2248":"SOLO, Indonesia, Jan. 31\u2014 Among the nearly 2,000 students crammed into Al Mukmin boarding school, Osama bin Laden is a hero. His photo, in full color and poster size, is plastered on the walls of the dormitories much as rock stars decorate teenagers' bedrooms in America. His face peers out from the inside of locker doors and appears on T-shirts worn under the preppy blazers of senior prefects.","2249":"Since Sept. 11, Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, the de facto Saudi ruler, has blamed criticism of the kingdom on Western media. The prince finally launched a counteroffensive, receiving reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post at one of his residential palaces. He called the U.S. a friend, branded its policy toward Palestinians inhumane and called Saudi-born Osama bin Laden a 'deviant.' He sent regards to President Bush and the American people, and then departed for a ceremonial sword dance. Elaine Sciolino","2250":"The negative reaction of the Arab and Muslim communities was enough to convince the screenwriter, Ed Zuckerman, to take his name out of the credits (he is listed as Ned Curren). 'It didn't seem prudent,' said Mr. Zuckerman, who has not publicly acknowledged his work on the film until now. The Sept. 11 attacks would also affect his work: he is an executive producer of the CBS drama series about the C.I.A., 'The Agency,' which pulled, shuffled and edited several episodes because of references to Osama bin Laden and anthrax.","2251":"My photographer and I were the only ones the Kenyan authorities put through emigration formalities. A television producer later suggested that I had been racially profiled. After all, she asked, who's the most likely threat: the Somali toting home a 100-pound bag of Kenyan rice, or the white American with the satellite phone who might call in an airstrike from the offshore fleet trying to make sure that Osama bin Laden doesn't slip into Somalia?","2252":"Efforts by the University of South Florida to protect his rights are extraordinary. Mr. Al-Arian spent almost two and a half years on paid leave because of a federal investigation in the mid-1990's into allegations that he operated a terrorist front. He helped bring to Tampa the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and he has been questioned about his relationship with a man who helped arrange ABC News's interview with Osama bin Laden three years ago.","2253":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 3\u2014 A month after United States officials expressed confidence that they had cornered Osama bin Laden in the mountains of Tora Bora, they now acknowledge that they have lost track of the terrorist leader and are increasingly frustrated over the virtual absence of intelligence on his whereabouts.","2254":"Mr. Ivanov complained about what he called double standards from the West for failing to condemn extremists in the Russian province of Chechnya with the same vigor as it has condemned Osama bin Laden.","2255":"LONDON\u2014 They told us it would be a long, ugly struggle, and so it is. America's war against terror has entered its second phase, a phase characterized by the storm over the status and human rights of the prisoners held at Camp X-Ray and by the frustrating failure of the United States to find Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar. Additionally, if America now attacks other countries suspected of harboring terrorists it will almost certainly do so alone. In spite of the military successes, America finds itself facing a broader ideological adversary that may turn out to be as hard to defeat as militant Islam: anti-Americanism, which is presently becoming more evident everywhere.","2256":"U.S. officials acknowledge they have lost track of Osama bin Laden, who was last traced to eastern Afghanistan in early December. PAGE A8","2257":"A month after they thought Osama bin Laden was cornered, United States officials acknowledge that they have lost track of him and are frustrated over a lack of intelligence about his whereabouts. A8","2258":"A similar chill is settling over world politics. Australia's government uses the threat of terrorism to justify incarcerating Afghan refugees in a desert compound. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have leveraged their provision of bases and intelligence into a carte blanche for domestic repression. Egypt, which for many years has used detention without trial, military courts and torture to keep control of militants, now demands an even freer hand. Sudan, which was under attack from a coalition of liberals and black churches determined to end slavery and stop Khartoum's war against the south, is now accepted as an ally against Osama bin Laden. And President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has decided that his longtime political opponents are really 'terrorists.'","2259":"Over the years, the hajj has been marred by fire, disease, demonstrations, stampedes and riots. Osama bin Laden and others who support him have said they were offended by the presence of American 'infidel' troops in Saudi Arabia because it is home to the holiest Muslim sites.","226":"More than a dozen Islamic militants have been arrested in Germany and Britain, and American officials say some were plotting terror attacks in Europe and elsewhere. The arrests are part of a crackdown on a network with ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi radical accused of plotting the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998. A1","2260":"Turkish intelligence authorities foiled the scheme, and 18 people were later convicted. But the conspiracy is being looked at again because of the discovery of evidence linking Osama bin Laden to the German-based group, which is led by a renegade Turkish preacher, Metin Kaplan. Mr. Kaplan advocates the killing of all nonbelievers and is bent in particular on the destruction of Turkey's secular government.","2261":"Since you've all told me privately that this is your position, why not make it public and get the benefit? This is how to bury Osama bin Laden and define for the world who the Arabs really are. If you can't take that risk, why should I?","2262":"Mr. Bush also used the event to chide newspapers and television for dwelling on the elusiveness of Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader.","2263":"The 10 charges accuse Mr. Lindh of training to fight with Osama bin Laden's terror network and then conspiring with the Taliban to kill Americans in Afghanistan.","2264":"Then, in an hourlong interview, he likened his effort to the search for Osama bin Laden and his deputies in Afghanistan.","2265":"Anti-American sentiment abounded even as the number of delegates from the United States this year, the forum's second, climbed to several hundred from a dozen last year. One popular T-shirt among fringe groups compared Osama bin Laden to Ernesto 'Che' Guevara and Jesus. No American flags were burned, though, apparently out of respect for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.","2266":"Osama bin Laden was held up as a role model, a man who had given up his wealth and comfortable life in Saudi Arabia to live in poverty and fight in Afghanistan, Mr. Sobri, a roadside food vendor, said today. His wife tended to their 6-month-old son in a stroller.","2267":"In Afghanistan, Mr. Tenet said, the United States had recovered documents that showed that Osama bin Laden was pursuing a sophisticated biological weapons research program. He said the group was also trying to acquire dangerous chemical agents and toxins, as well as a weapon that would disperse radioactive materials.","2268":"'First of all, Osama bin Laden is absolutely justified in the terror he has caused on 9-11,' Mr. Bishop wrote. 'He has brought a mighty nation to its knees! God blesses him and the others who helped make September 11th happen.'","2269":"In Afghanistan, Mr. Tenet said, the United States had recovered documents that showed that Osama bin Laden was pursuing a sophisticated biological weapons research program. He said the group was also trying to acquire dangerous chemical agents and toxins, as well as a weapon that would disperse radioactive materials.","227":"A former close aide to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden testified yesterday that he offered officials of the Saudi government a plan to assassinate Mr. bin Laden, and later discussed his proposal with American officials.","2271":"As for matters within Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai was asked when he might ask American forces to leave his country and abandon their quest for Osama bin Laden. His answer suggested that he did not want that moment to come any time soon.","2272":"After the attacks, he held secret discussions with Pakistani officials about the possibility of handing over Osama bin Laden to the Americans, officials in Pakistan have said. Mullah Muttawakil is believed to have viewed Mr. bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan as an obstacle to gaining international acceptance for the Taliban, according to a person close to the Taliban leadership who knows Mullah Muttawakil well.","2273":"When the sergeant and his unit arrived by helicopter on Jan. 3, they were the first Americans deployed here since the beginning of ground operations in October. They came mainly to pursue reports that two of their most wanted quarries -- Osama bin Laden and Jalaluddin Haqqani, the Taliban's commander in the southern provinces -- might be holed up in mountains near town.","2275":"So, to begin with, maybe -- just maybe -- there is no Jewish conspiracy against Muslims or Saudi Arabia at work here. Maybe, just maybe, many Americans are upset because 15 Saudis took part in the Sept. 11 attacks, private Saudi charities financed Osama bin Laden and hundreds of Saudis fought with Al Qaeda against America in Afghanistan. And these hard facts have hardened U.S. opinion against them.","2276":"As Salman Rushdie says, you don't have to travel far to find anti-Americanism (Op-Ed, Feb. 4). Teaching at a Canadian university, I have been astounded by some students who say the Al Qaeda attacks, inside or outside the United States, were justified because only Americans were targeted. Remaking Osama bin Laden in their own anti-American image, they insist he has no quarrel with Canada or others, just the United States.","2277":"TALIBAN AND AL QAEDA -- The Taliban's foreign minister, Mullah Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, surrendered to Afghanistan's interim government and was handed over to U.S. forces in Kandahar, becoming the highest ranking member of the regime in custody. A rare moderate, he had apparently chafed at how Osama bin Laden obstructed international acceptance of the Taliban, and after Sept. 11 reportedly held secret discussions with Pakistani officials about handing him over to the Americans. The terms of his surrender were not clear.","2278":"Nonetheless, and despite a disastrous street battle in 1993 that unraveled its successful effort to feed Somalia, the United States has taken a new interest in the country since Sept. 11, believing that it may become Osama bin Laden's hiding place, a refuge for experienced terrorists and a breeding ground for new ones.","2279":"Military and intelligence officials said the drone had loitered over the Zawar Kili area, in Paktia Province, for several hours and had spotted a group of men near a truck at a camp believed to have been used by Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","228":"Spurred by growing international alarm about Osama bin Laden's militant networks, the police in Britain and Germany have recently arrested more than a dozen Islamic radicals. American officials say some of those arrested were plotting terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere.","2280":"For example, Iran and Syria were both sharply critical of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and the attacks of Sept. 11. Nevertheless, they are both enemies of Western values and interests. Both have energetically backed terrorism: the former has just been caught out dispatching arms to foment violence against Israel. Iran is also making strides toward developing long-range missiles that could be armed with nuclear warheads.","2281":"Mr. Miller's pairing with Ms. Walters, executives said, would help it do that and would be especially helpful in closing the divide between 'World News Tonight' and 'Nightline' on one side and the news magazine programs on the other. Mr. Miller -- one of only a handful of correspondents to have interviewed Osama bin Laden -- is more likely than past anchors to produce '20/20' segments on subjects appealing to Mr. Jennings and his producer, Paul Slavin.","2282":"In fact, Somalia has not bothered us since we stopped bothering it. Sudan evicted Osama bin Laden not because of American nation-building but because of our threats. Afghanistan really became a threat to us only after the Taliban ended two decades of chaos there and welcomed Osama bin Laden. Our enemy is not chaos, but states that support terrorism.","2283":"The judge dismissed a charge that the Jordanian-American, Raed Hijazi, belonged to an illegal organization -- identified in court documents as Al Qaeda -- saying there was no evidence that Osama bin Laden's organization had a formal structure or membership in Jordan.","2284":"The lawyer for a suspected aide to Osama bin Laden, citing a survey suggesting that the New York City jury pool has been tainted by the Sept. 11 attack, formally asked yesterday that the man's trial in a jailhouse assault be moved.","2285":"More recently, in the years of headlong Islamic jihad before the Sept. 11 attacks, fervent Muslims inspired by the Taliban and Osama bin Laden plotted their various holy wars in the recesses of Karachi's endless warrens of concrete block.","2286":"For years, the Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Laden has vowed to purge the kingdom of the 'infidel' American military presence from the country of the two holy shrines. Those threats have made American military commanders particularly uneasy about discussing religious services for their troops.","2287":"Among other things, Mr. Khawaja, a former air force officer, is said by Pakistani officials to have once served as a pilot for Osama bin Laden.","2288":"On a recent day at Emory University here, for example, students in Suzanne Werner's introductory course in international politics talked about the nature of power and why groups like the Taliban might resort to force. In Kenneth Stein's freshmen seminar on the Middle East, students plunged into the roots of religious fundamentalism and why Osama bin Laden felt threatened. In J. Larry Taulbee's seminar, 'Governing the Use of Force,' students debated whether American bombing in Afghanistan was justified.","2289":"There had been some speculation that the tall man in the group was Osama bin Laden, but Pentagon officials said they had no evidence of that.","229":"Yesterday, the host, a man named L'Houssaine Kherchtou, related the story of his visitors at the trial of four men accused of joining a terrorist conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden that resulted in the deadly bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","2290":"A senior official of Afghanistan's interim government, Yunus Qanooni, said elements in Pakistan's intelligence service had helped Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammad Omar evade capture. A19","2291":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 12\u2014 A senior official of Afghanistan's interim government, in comments published today, accused elements in Pakistan's intelligence service of helping Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammad Omar evade capture.","2292":"The Pakistani intelligence agents detained in the case were retired officials who had close ties with members of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan during the 1980's, including Osama bin Laden.","2293":"Mr. Ashcroft described the 17 men, most of them Yemenis, as 'individuals who may be associated with Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network.' Other law enforcement officials said they suspected that some were Qaeda members, although they did not know how many.","2294":"Mr. Zubaydah has been one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants since the late 1990's, and American intelligence agencies believe that he was at Mr. bin Laden's side in Afghanistan in the first weeks after Sept. 11. His whereabouts today are unknown, although Bush administration officials say there is fragmentary evidence that he escaped to Pakistan.","2295":"It's not that poor people become terrorists. The hijackers on 9/11 were mostly from middle-class homes. But poverty, alienation and frustration nurture guerrilla groups that are often led by those from privileged backgrounds (Mao, the son of a moderately prosperous landowner who led a peasant revolution, is an example; so is Osama bin Laden).","2296":"Mr. Ashcroft described the 17 men as 'individuals who may be associated with Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network.' Other law enforcement officials said they suspected that some were Al Qaeda members.","2297":"Canadian hockey fans do not talk about Osama bin Laden as they chant and march -- and occasionally stagger -- across Temple Street.","2298":"In his world view, a vast Jewish conspiracy is behind every event, including the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Like his old friend and student Osama bin Laden, he has divided the world into good Muslims and everybody else, saying that supporters of the American war in Afghanistan are infidels.","2299":"An article on Dec. 29 about a news conference at which President Bush spoke in Crawford, Tex., added a word erroneously to his reply on his watching of a broadcast videotape of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush said, 'I didn't watch it all'; he did not say 'at all.' The error was pointed out in a letter dated Dec. 29 from a reader who noticed a discrepancy with the published excerpts; the letter was misrouted at The Times.","23":"For more than four years, prosecutors argued, Mr. Fitzgerald and another prosecutor, Kenneth M. Karas, had investigated the activities of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities suspect was the mastermind behind the embassy attacks and other terrorism against Americans. Mr. Fitzgerald's vast experience placed him 'in a unique position to prosecute this extraordinarily complex case,' the government added, and that was why his presence had been so critical in the Odeh interrogation.","230":"Several years ago, the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden told his followers in Sudan that he had money problems, and was cutting back on salaries and travel budgets. But Mr. bin Laden was known as a man of great wealth, and one member of his group, L'Houssaine Kherchtou, asked one of his aides for $500 to cover the cost of a Caesarean section for his wife. He was refused.","2300":"The government has said it seized incriminating evidence in those searches, including a box cutter and a photograph of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Awadallah was later brought to New York, and after testifying twice before a federal grand jury, he was charged with two counts of perjury.","2301":"American government officials said one of the people in the group was tall and was being treated with deference by those around him. That gave rise to speculation that the attack might have been directed at Osama bin Laden, who is 6-feet-4.","2302":"But as journalists on the ground in Afghanistan became able to make their way along the rough and dangerous roads in recent weeks, a much more complex and disturbing picture began emerging. Indeed, it often seemed that there were two different wars being reported: the neat, efficient one of the Pentagon briefings and the messier one in the field, where there were civilian casualties, botched raids and -- lest it be forgotten -- the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar and the Al Qaeda leadership.","2303":"But you don't have to look far below the glittering surface of that decade to discover that history was, in fact, still in motion. It is not just that Osama bin Laden and his ilk were busy hatching their plots in the caves of Afghanistan. The global economy was always much shakier than most people imagined. One of the most severe economic crises since World War II occurred in 1998, a crisis of confidence that swept through the developing world and even threatened to spread to the United States.","2305":"But Mr. Awadallah charges that he was coerced into speaking to the authorities and into allowing them to search his apartment and two cars. Prosecutors say they found incriminating evidence, including a box cutter and a photograph of Osama bin Laden, after finding Mr. Awadallah's name written on a piece of paper in a car rented by one of the suspected hijackers.","2306":"Officials said available evidence suggested they had played no role in the Sept. 11 attacks or Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network, and the immigration cases against some of them were resolved as long as four months ago.","2307":"Canada has been a concern to American policy makers since a Montreal-based Algerian named Ahmed Ressam, suspected of being a follower of Osama bin Laden, tried to enter Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada in late 1999. He had 130 pounds of explosives in his car, apparently to bomb the Los Angeles airport during millennium celebrations.","2308":"As part of the effort to counter the pronouncements of the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and their supporters, the State Department has already hired a former advertising executive to run its public diplomacy office, and the White House has created a public information 'war room' to coordinate the administration's daily message domestically and abroad.","2309":"The pressures have left many young people confused and restless, and admiring of the radical defiance of the Saudi-born Osama bin Laden. However, there appears to be little appetite for the terrorism and violence advocated by bin Laden. Rather, young men are rebelling in other ways: by luring police officers into 120 mile-an-hour chases on the freeways, tossing firecrackers into crowds at soccer matches, even disguising themselves as women to infiltrate women-only spaces. On the night of the incident in Dammam, two young men were killed during a high-speed joy ride when their Toyota Camry hit a lamppost.","231":"Although four of the defendants named in the government's enormous indictment -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- are in custody and appear in court each day, the testimony and exhibits presented so far have focused on a man who is nowhere to be found: Osama bin Laden.","2310":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19\u2014 The families of seven victims of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center filed a class-action lawsuit today against Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as Iran and Iraq.","2311":"The war against global terrorism is fought not just in the military arena but also in the international exchange of news and information. Osama bin Laden and his allies are gifted propagandists who have spread a welter of malicious misinformation throughout the Muslim world. The White House understandably would like to knock down these falsehoods and get its own message out quickly and efficiently to foreign audiences. But this must be done in a sensible, sophisticated and honorable way rather than the duplicitous fashion the Pentagon has in mind.","2312":"BURBANK, Calif., Feb. 19\u2014 Vice President Dick Cheney took America's war on terror to late-night television today, mixing jokes about his diet and elusive work habits with a renewed vow to hunt down Osama bin Laden.","2313":"The families of seven victims of the attack on the World Trade Center filed a class-action lawsuit against Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as Iran and Iraq. A11","2314":"American officials have publicly pledged not to walk away from Afghanistan once the hunt for Osama bin Laden is over, and they do not want the country once again to become a breeding pool for terrorists.","2315":"She said there was no proof of a long-term shift in public opinion, adding that if Osama bin Laden was captured, brought to the United States and found to be mentally retarded, public opinion would not regard him as ineligible to be executed.","2316":"The police said that one of the men arrested here was believed to have ties to seven Tunisians now standing trial in Milan, who are under investigation for planning to attack the United States Embassy last January. The police have accused these men, who are charged with arms trafficking and falsifying documents, of links to Osama bin Laden.","2317":"More than 600 American soldiers are in the Philippines to train and advise the Philippine military in fighting an Islamic group, Abu Sayyaf, that has been linked to Osama bin Laden. Abu Sayyaf, which operates on Basilan and other nearby islands, is holding two American missionaries hostage.","2318":"Last night several items related to Osama bin Laden were listed on the site.","2319":"The F.B.I.'s Web site now has him at the top of that list, alongside Osama bin Laden. The United States is offering $2 million for information leading to his conviction.","2320":"By contrast, the Deobandi madrassas of Pakistan became training grounds for holy war and many of the Taliban leaders. Masood Azhar, Deobandi leader of the Pakistan-based Army of Muhammad, is believed to have been behind terrorist attacks on India, and the Taliban, as the Deobandi harborers of Osama bin Laden, posed a mortal threat to the United States.","2321":"I was told this was not the true feeling here. I was told the hijackers were actually educated in America. I was told they were sent by Mossad or the C.I.A. I was told in one session that the Jews control the U.S. government and that was the real problem, a statement that prompted me to walk out. I was told the hijackers were responding to Arab anger over blind U.S. support for Israel's brutality to Palestinians. If that was the case, I asked, why did Osama bin Laden say that what motivated him was a desire to drive the U.S. out of Arabia and topple the corrupt Saudi ruling family? I got no good answers.","2322":"Insurers also look at the nature of the business to be insured, said Mr. Minor, who is in charge of political risk coverage at Aon. A chemical plant, he said, is a riskier proposition than a cannery; joint ventures with local partners are more likely to go wrong than businesses in which the foreign owner has more control; and high-technology companies are less likely to become targets for government takeover than some other businesses because their success depends upon highly skilled managers. These days, as the United States pursues Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Yemen, Sudan and other Islamic nations top the insurers' list of risky places to do business.","2323":"They would rather make troops available as props in gung-ho videos than available to explain how the commanders let Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda leaders escape or targeted the wrong villages. Mr. Bruckheimer said his program would not usurp reporters' access. 'Reporters are after breaking news,' he said. 'We're doing profiles.' He said the Pentagon would check the show before it aired, as it did with 'Black Hawk Down': 'It's not censorship, but we do have a conversation.'","2324":"In his review of my book 'Warrior Politics' (Feb. 3), Donald Kagan suggests that I identify with fatalists like Chamberlain rather than with idealists like Churchill and Reagan, even as he admits that Churchill is my 'exemplary statesman.' In fact, in the book I write that 'an ordinary man who values freedom will often recognize the truth. Ronald Reagan was such a man.' I go on to say that 'Churchill and Reagan represented strategic and moral decisiveness against considerable odds.' I devote an entire chapter to a celebration of Churchill's hardheaded morality. In 'Warrior Politics,' completed months before Sept. 11, I use Churchill's support for a moral intervention in Sudan in the 1890's to justify the need for us to hunt down Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.","2325":"First there was 911 and 9/11, used to signify not just the date, but everything that happened on it and afterward. There were terms like ground zero, evildoers, Al Qaeda and Taliban. Then there was post-Taliban and anti-Taliban and Sept. 10 'as an adjective meaning oblivious to danger or na\u00efve,' Professor Glowka said. 'I nearly drove off the road when I heard Rush Limbaugh reading an article someone had passed him about the Osamaniacs,' he said. The word was being used for women infatuated with Osama bin Laden. The professor said he grabbed a tissue and scribbled Osamaniacs on it. Later, he said, he happened upon a related term, Osamaphiles.","2326":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 23\u2014 After weeks of uncertainty over the fate of Osama bin Laden, senior administration officials now say they have fresh indications that he survived the bombing assault on Tora Bora and other Afghan mountain regions, and that he is probably still in the remote terrain that straddles the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.","2327":"Fresh evidence suggests that Osama bin Laden survived bombing in Tora Bora and is probably hiding in mountains near Pakistan, officials said. 1","2328":"Saudi posturing serves three purposes: (1) to counter U.S. repugnance at financial support of hate-America mosques that resulted in the Sept. 11 attacks by 15 Saudis, (2) to pretend that the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is the source of the Arab world's discontents, a pretense also adopted by Osama bin Laden, and (3) to prepare the ground for a denial of our Saudi bases to support an attack on Saddam Hussein's germ factories.","2329":"Officials said today that the police had not found a definitive link between the suspects and Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network.","233":"On a typical weekend, the witness said, Osama bin Laden liked to relax at his farm near the Blue Nile in Sudan, where he spent time riding horses. His followers would often accompany him, the witness went on, and they would picnic on the grounds of the farm or swim or amuse themselves by playing soccer.","2330":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 25\u2014 An analysis of suspected radioactive substances seized in Afghanistan has found nothing to prove that Osama bin Laden reached his decade-long goal of acquiring nuclear materials for a bomb, administration officials say.","2331":"An analysis of suspected radioactive substances seized in Afghanistan found nothing that would prove Osama bin Laden had acquired nuclear materials for a bomb. A1","2332":"The list demonstrates that the administration has broadened its sights to include terrorists not linked to Osama bin Laden or to attacks on the United States. As Mr. O'Neill put it: 'Our crackdown on terrorists is blind to nationality and origin. It's a net being cast on all terrorist parasites that threaten our allies and our national security.'","2333":"The assault trial of a man suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden should not be moved out of New York City because of the Sept. 11 terror attack, federal prosecutors have told a judge. The defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is accused of attacking a guard in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in November 2000 while awaiting trial on terrorism conspiracy charges. The guard was stabbed in the eye with a comb made into a knife. Mr. Salim has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In their court papers, filed Monday, prosecutors rejected claims that Mr. Salim could not receive a fair trial in New York. The assault case, they wrote, 'has nothing to do with terrorism in general or the World Trade Center attack in particular.' Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","2334":"The aim of the training mission, which has not yet been approved by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, would be to prepare Georgian troops for combatting foreign fighters that have been operating in a mountainous region of the country and could have links to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","2335":"This is how the Soviet school sees it: The ruling al-Saud brothers are like the old Soviet Politburo; the 50,000 al-Saud princes and relatives are the equivalent of the Communist Party. Wahhabism, the puritanical Saudi Arabian brand of Islam, is used by the al-Sauds to unite the 40 fractious tribes of the Arabian Peninsula, just as Communism was used by Lenin to unite the 100 fractious nationalities of Russia and its neighboring republics. Osama bin Laden is just the evil version of Andrei Sakharov -- the insider who steps outside the system to declare that the king has no clothes. Sakharov was exiled to Gorky for that and bin Laden to Kabul. And ultimately, both systems went into decline after unhappy encounters where? In Afghanistan.","2336":"Top Russian officials have even suggested -- while admitting they have no proof -- that Osama bin Laden could find refuge in Pankisi Gorge. A Chechen rebel commander, Ruslan Gelayev, has set up training camps for fighters who use the gorge as a rear area for rest, training and arms supply, Russian officials said. Western officials say some criminals operate from the gorge, in league with corrupt Georgian politicians.","2337":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 27\u2014 The United States is trying indirectly to obtain samples of DNA from relatives of Osama bin Laden for possible future use in identifying his remains, American officials said today.","2338":"'I have a right to leave a foul message,' he said, adding that the statute was so absurd that if he called up Osama bin Laden, used a vulgarity and told him 'I wish he dies of cancer, here in New York I could be arrested.'","2339":"'Clearly, we've got to find Muhammad Omar, we've got to find Osama bin Laden, and we've got to find other key leaders of the Al Qaeda network, or we will have failed,' Mr. Daschle said. At the same time, referring to expansion of the campaign against terror, he added: 'Before we make commitments in resources, I think we need to have a clearer understanding of what the direction will be.'","234":"After his recovery, Mr. Odeh spent nearly three months immersed in the study of Islamic law. It was then, Agent Anticep said, that he was approached by Al Qaeda, the group run by Osama bin Laden, whom prosecutors have accused of masterminding the embassy attacks.","2340":"The Pentagon has long viewed Yemen as a center of support for Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader. His father was born there. Yemen was also the site of the terrorist attack on the destroyer Cole, which killed 17 American sailors in October 2000.","2341":"President Bush brushed off criticism from the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, that the United States war on terrorism will have failed if Osama bin Laden is not found. A11","2342":"It is understandable that the man in the street might confuse the success of this difficult military and diplomatic action with the capture of Osama bin Laden and others, but we should expect more from our elected officials. Mr. Daschle's behavior undermines this country's declared goal of defeating Al Qaeda and terrorism, regardless of their leaders.","2343":"Administration officials have reported in recent days that an analysis of suspected radioactive substances seized from Al Qaeda compounds in Afghanistan found nothing to show that Osama bin Laden and his followers had reached their decade-long goal of acquiring nuclear materials for a bomb.","2344":"DES MOINES, March 1\u2014 President Bush brushed off criticism today from Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, who has said that the United States will have failed in its war on terror if Osama bin Laden is not found.","2345":"American popular culture, American film, American pop music, American fast food and American television manage to inspire both love and hate, as if the two passions were inseparable parts of a single whole, evoking the video image last fall of Osama bin Laden wearing what appeared to be a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch. So while the Taliban tried to quash the cultural influences of the West -- hanging televisions from trees like electronic corpses -- Afghan women were risking their lives by secretly going to Western-style beauty parlors.","2346":"In the last two months, American warplanes and commandos have staged many raids against suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda compounds, but senior American military officials said the offensive today was more akin to the broad campaign late last year in Tora Bora, where heavy bombing and ground operations over several weeks routed hard-core Qaeda warriors from a last remaining stronghold, but apparently did not kill or capture Osama bin Laden.","2347":"Planning for the Gardez offensive has been under way for weeks amid reports that Al Qaeda fighters have been regrouping in the region. The goal is not just to kill remnants of the Qaeda force but to capture some. Still, there is no hard intelligence that indicates that Osama bin Laden or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, is in the area.","2348":"Notably, some detainees have said they had heard that hijackers were being trained in an Afghan camp before the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, officials said. Several have also said they saw Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, and suggested to interrogators that Mr. bin Laden quickly shifted his headquarters to the mountainous region around Tora Bora after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","2349":"Even more than the scourge of terror, the Palestinian plight has seized the conscience of the kingdom. Television is dominated by one-sided images of the Palestinians -- and none of Israelis -- as victims of violence. Sympathy for the cause of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist, runs high, Saudi officials and academics say, not because Saudis like terrorism, but because he has latched onto the Palestinian cause.","235":"The statement also revealed for the first time that on the eve of the bombing, 'people' in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the attack, was based, had already hunkered down in anticipation of an American military strike. In Kandahar, Afghanistan, Mr. Odeh's statement says, these people, who were never identified, believed there was a 'possibility of the U.S. Navy sending in warplanes or missiles to retaliate.'","2351":"AL QAEDA: The U.S. government is quietly using intermediaries to obtain DNA samples from the bin Laden family. Intelligence analysts believe Osama bin Laden remains alive, but a fatal U.S. attack of Feb. 4 on three men near Khost, Afghanistan, raised interest in DNA testing to be certain none of the three was Mr. bin Laden.","2352":"'I'm looking for a dangerous man,' Sardono prompted the dancer to roar. 'They say Osama bin Laden is here.' The cowboy then receives a call on his mobile phone, to which Sardono encourages the dancer to yell again: 'Afghanistan, finished. Philippines. O.K., Philippines, we'll go there.' This is a reference to the Philippine government agreeing to accept American troops on its territory to eliminate a local terrorist group.","2353":"During the December battle at Tora Bora, the American military relied heavily on the combination of its Afghan allies and small teams of Special Operations forces to prevent its foe from escaping. The strategy avoided American casualties but hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters, possibly including Osama bin Laden, got away.","2354":"Today, Mr. Daschle again expressed reservations about these plans. He said the first phase of the war was not yet complete, noting that Osama bin Laden, whose Al Qaeda network is considered responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, was still at large.","2355":"In conversations beside the town's bazaar, residents of Zormat did not recall seeing any of the highest echelon of Taliban and Qaeda leaders, or at least they were unwilling to say they had witnessed them. This appeared to leave the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, as much a mystery as ever. Capturing or killing these two was among America's highest priorities when the bombing began on Oct. 7.","2356":"A major concern for American commanders has been that Taliban and Qaeda units might still have some of the hundreds of American-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles that turned Afghanistan into a graveyard for Soviet aircraft during the Muslim guerrilla struggle of the 1980's, when Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, learned battlefield skills.","2357":"Later, Mr. Bush sounded unconcerned about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, and obliquely hinted that he was already dead. 'I haven't heard from him since September-December the 11th,' he said. 'He's been awfully quiet. I don't know why. But I know he's on the run, if he's running at all.'","2358":"The main reason America sent troops to Afghanistan was to destroy Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. With thousands of Qaeda fighters still at large, and top leaders like Osama bin Laden unaccounted for, military operations must go on, and experience shows that American ground forces will need to play a central role.","2359":"American officials said the new communications traffic was a serious concern because they feared that Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network, could use its sophisticated Internet ability to launch new terror attacks against the United States.","236":"BRITAIN: TERROR CRACKDOWN -- The government named 21 groups that can no longer be active or raise money in Britain, under a new law aimed at ending international complaints that Britain is a haven for groups plotting violence abroad. Among those on the terror list were: the Greek November 17 organization; the Basque separatist E.T.A.; Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers; Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden; Hezbollah; the People's Mujahedeen of Iran; and Algerian, Egyptian, Palestinian, Kashmiri and Turkish groups. Warren Hoge (NYT)","2360":"The switch made for a stark contrast with the battle three months ago in the Tora Bora mountains in eastern Afghanistan, when American Special Forces directing Afghan fighters in a frustrated hunt for Osama bin Laden and other top Qaeda and Taliban leaders played only a limited role, leaving much of the assault to aerial bombardment.","2361":"Tourism nose-dived in 1998 after it was disclosed that one of the men involved in the terrorist bombing of the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam was from Pemba, the smaller of the two main islands that make up Zanzibar. Khalfan Khamis Muhammad, an operative working for Osama bin Laden, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for helping to make the explosives used to attack the embassy on Aug. 7, 1998.","2362":"Though American officials sought to play down expectations, senior Afghan officials have begun to hint that the real prize in the combat now unfolding at heights of up to 10,000 feet could include capturing or killing of some of the highest-ranking leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, perhaps even Osama bin Laden.","2363":"The French police were questioning the wife of a man accused of plotting to blow up the American Embassy in Paris and suspected of having links with Osama bin Laden.","2364":"In the last few days the governor, an American citizen who only recently returned to his native country after a decade in Los Angeles, has been strongly suggesting that Osama bin Laden may be present in the Paktia mountains, making a last stand.","2365":"Both President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have said that our troops are having trouble finding Osama bin Laden, but that we're gonna get him!","2366":"In contrast, Indonesia 'is a place of interest,' the official said. But asked about widely rumored discussions under way with the government of President Megawati Sukarnoputri on deeper American involvement in Indonesia, where anti-American sentiment is running strong, the official refused to comment, and would not discuss the administration's evaluation of whether Al Qaeda is using the country, where sympathy to Osama bin Laden is keen in some areas.","2367":"'There's no doubt in my mind that much of our presence is destabilizing to the government,' said one senior military officer. 'The best thing we can do is to make a measured decrease in our presence. The dilemma we face is that if we leave right now, it looks like we're caving to Osama bin Laden's demands.'","2368":"Should we inscribe the name of Osama bin Laden in the ever-lengthening book of famous plagiarists? In two videotapes broadcast after Sept. 11, the terrorist is shown reciting a poem that most viewers assumed he wrote himself. In one tape, he chants it to his dinner guests in a safe house; in the other, his most recent public address, he weaves the poem into a tearful homage to the 19 hijackers. The lines, however, were not bin Laden's. A few weeks after the second videotape was shown in December, a Jordanian who said he was the cousin of the actual poet published a small article in the London-based newspaper Al Hayat accusing bin Laden of plagiarism.","2369":"This is dangerous. The notion is taking hold -- it started with Osama bin Laden, was refined by Palestinian suicide bombers and is cheered on by Hezbollah, Iran and other radicals -- that with a combination of demographics (a baby boom) and terrorism, the Arabs can actually destroy Israel. Some radicals even fantasize that they can undermine America.","237":"Afghans have been at war for 22 years, first in an epic resistance against Soviet troops, then in factional, back-stabbing combat against each other. Most of the nation is now ruled by Taliban mullahs who offend the West with their stern interpretations of Islam and their unflagging hospitality to the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.","2371":"Late last summer, Indonesia's newly elected vice president, Hamzah Haz, welcomed a string of guests into his official residence, only a short walk from the sprawling American Embassy compound in downtown Jakarta. Among the academics and politicos he greeted was a 40-year-old Muslim cleric named Jaffar Umar Thalib. A photograph in a local newspaper the next day showed him and the vice president locked in a warm embrace. Outside Indonesia, however, this visit by Jaffar -- who was, even then, arguably the most feared Islamic militant in the most populous Muslim nation on earth and who would soon be mentioned in the same breath as Osama bin Laden -- went largely unreported.","2372":"The authorities in Uzbekistan have essentially untied the militia's hands. If militiamen kill citizens, they can simply fill out documents claiming the victim was a terrorist, or even a follower of Osama bin Laden. No civilian has any ability to question this characterization.","2373":"What is Mr. Philbin, a Defense Department spokesman, so eagerly awaiting? Toilet paper. Two hundred rolls of it, each sheet imprinted with Osama bin Laden's face and the all-too-easy pun, 'Wipe Out Terrorism.'","2374":"TUNIS\u2014 Since Sept. 11, the world has come to know more about the educational systems prevalent today in Muslim countries and their role in promoting hostility toward the West. The educational system of Osama bin Laden's native Saudi Arabia is being criticized in the West, particularly in the United States. The Indian government last December announced an effort to reform the Muslim religious schools known as madrasas, though this is perhaps a mixed blessing given that the same government is using the schools to promote Hinduism as part of its nationalist program. Across the border in Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf is pursuing reform of his country's educational system -- a project that will be watched by other Muslim nations. Education was a major subject of discussion in Mr. Musharraf's meeting with President Bush last month. This was itself something rather new.","2375":"'I think this is a country of followers,' said Sgt. Justin Adamson, 22, of Oregon, Ohio. 'Osama bin Laden comes along with money, so they follow him. So who are they going to follow next? If they followed the Taliban, they'll follow anyone.'","2376":"A federal judge refused yesterday to move the assault trial of a man suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden out of Manhattan, saying he could receive a fair trial in New York.","2377":"The crackdown was the first since Sept. 11 to result from a joint effort by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Administration officials said it was a sign of increasing cooperation with the kingdom, which was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the terrorist attacks and which the United States feels has been slow to take action against suspected supporters of Osama bin Laden and other terrorist organizations.","2378":"There is no way of knowing how many Afghans listen, but the Pentagon contends that Commando Solo has undermined faith in Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden, and won support for the American-backed interim government and its chairman, Hamid Karzai.","2379":"The fight now is between three different views: The first is Osama bin Laden's. His view is that there is no place for a Jewish state, or other 'infidels,' particularly Americans, in the Muslim world.","238":"The four men have been accused of joining with Osama bin Laden in a terrorist plot that led to the Nairobi blast, which killed more than 200 people. It was nearly simultaneous with the bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania, which killed 11 more.","2380":"Asked why he so rarely talked these days about Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, he suggested that even if Mr. bin Laden is alive, he had been 'marginalized.' The president called Mr. bin Laden 'the ultimate parasite.'","2382":"'If I were Osama bin Laden, I'd be on lookout for an alienated, vulnerable character like Batouti,' Mr. Brokaw said. If an investigation were carried out in Egypt, 'It's conceivable you might find people who knew something about them both.'","2383":"As for the Bosnian Muslims, the film says there is ample evidence documenting Bosnians' alliance with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.","2384":"Suspicious immigration officials at the airport noted that I had only a carry-on bag, stuffed with electronic gear, and that my passport had Pakistani and Afghan visas. Worried that I might be an agent of Osama bin Laden, they seized my passport and took me aside -- over the protests of the Information Ministry official who had come to the airport to welcome me and show me Yemeni hospitality.","2385":"He said he did not believe that Osama bin Laden or any other senior member of either group were in the valley during the American-led assault. Just the same, General Hagenbeck said, he wanted to be sure.","2386":"Mr. Cheney's meetings here come during a period of strain in American-Saudi relations. The American public is well aware that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11 attacks were Saudis. There have also been concerns that the Saudi authorities have not done enough to stem fund-raising for militants like Osama bin Laden.","2388":"It is a rare collection, the raw, unmediated stuff of the jihadis' lives. Individually, the documents are shards -- as mundane as a grocery list and as chilling as notes for the proper positioning of a truck bomb. But taken together, they tell a rich inside story of the network of radical Islamic groups that Osama bin Laden helped assemble in Afghanistan.","2389":"WASHINGTON\u2014 The actual text (and annotated subtext) of President Bush's remarks on Osama bin Laden at his press conference on Wednesday:","239":"An audio and visual specialist, Mr. Blum is called in to make sure all gadgetry is running smoothly, particularly now that there is a complex case like the current one, where four men are accused of conspiring in the bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa. Security is huge, with the specter of Osama bin Laden, the distant Saudi exile and accused mastermind, looming in the air.","2390":"The Taliban and Al Qaeda resistance near Gardez was a bracing display for fighters who, despite their appearance as a ragged band of fanatics, had achieved a level of competence that American military officials say was on par with the world's best guerrilla forces. It also demonstrated the degree to which Osama bin Laden and other jihad leaders had turned Afghanistan's network of training bases and guest houses, typically described as terror schools, into a sort of two-tiered university for waging Islamic war.","2391":"American spooks worry that Yemen might provide a new base for terrorists like Osama bin Laden (who in a 1996 interview praised Yemen, his ancestral home, as a place in which he might settle). That's the reason for trying to bolster the government by training its army. It's a worthy goal, and if the training were conducted in the United States or in another country like Saudi Arabia it would not risk undermining the government's moral authority.","2393":"Not surprisingly, the authorities appear intent on seeking the harshest punishment possible in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui (no doubt partly out of frustration at the failure to apprehend Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar).","2394":"At one point, analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency also became suspicious of a fertilizer plant in Mazar-i-Sharif, which was situated near one of Osama bin Laden's compounds. The analysts feared that the plant's equipment could be used for chemical or biological weapons production.","2395":"Last November, when American officials believed that they had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, a large number of Al Qaeda forces, and possibly Mr. bin Laden himself, were thought to have slipped into Pakistan.","2396":"The warrant also states that the government is seeking 'any and all information' that refers to Osama bin Laden, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman -- the blind sheik who is serving a life term in prison for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center -- and several other people the government has designated as terrorists.","2397":"There is ample evidence that the Qaeda organization wanted weapons of mass destruction, including biological agents. Osama bin Laden is said to have considered the acquisition of such weapons a religious obligation.","2398":"That's why Osama bin Laden is not a mere terrorist. He has much larger aspirations. He is a super-empowered angry man who has all the geopolitical objectives and instincts of a nation-state. He has employed violence not to grab headlines but to kill as many Americans as possible to drive them out of the Islamic world and weaken their society. That's why the Sept. 11 hijackers never left a list of demands, as terrorists usually do. Their act was their demand. Their demand is total victory.","24":"Unfortunately, this same wired world also super-empowers angry people. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire allegedly responsible for blowing up two U.S. embassies in East Africa, is a super-empowered angry man. He had his own network, a sort of Jihad Online (JOL), which he used to take on the U.S. and kill Americans. And do you know what we did to him? We fired 75 cruise missiles at him. We fired 75 cruise missiles at a person! That was a superpower versus a super-empowered angry man.","240":"He said the decision to destroy Afghanistan's pre-Islamic heritage may have been a response to the isolation felt by the Taliban since United Nations sanctions were imposed on the nation in January for failing to surrender Saudi militant Osama bin Laden.","2400":"When the leaders of the same countries gathered in Japan two months ago to talk about Afghanistan, they pledged $4.5 billion to support a government whose economic policies might be described, generously, as inchoate. The biggest check on corruption may be that the Taliban already robbed the central bank of its last afghani. Yet the only string attached to Afghanistan's aid was the promise that it would remain friendly to the United States -- and keep Osama bin Laden in the hills.","2401":"Third, anger over the Palestinian issue is the most likely spark for domestic unrest during trying economic times, and it could help the recruitment efforts of the those, like Osama bin Laden, who attract recruits by denouncing Israel as they seek the violent overthrow of their own Arab governments.","2402":"An analysis of notebooks and papers collected from Afghan training bases and guest houses showed how Osama bin Laden and other jihad leaders created, in effect, a two-tiered university of holy war: a core curriculum of weapons instruction and battle tactics and, for standout fighters, specialized training in advanced infantry techniques or terrorist actions, like bomb-making and espionage. Whether they spoke Tajik, Uzbek or Arabic, the thousands of men who passed through these camps, in a dozen or so different locations in Afghanistan, copied into their own notebooks the same basic lessons -- some drawn directly from U.S. training manuals.","2403":"Mr. Sharon would be relaxing his tough stance by allowing the Palestinian leader to attend the Arab meeting unless he obtained some commitments from Mr. Arafat in return, like an agreement to an Israeli-Palestinian truce and steps to stop attacks by Palestinian militants. Without any moves by Mr. Arafat, allowing him to attend the Beirut meeting would be a very difficult political step for the prime minister, who has compared Mr. Arafat to Osama bin Laden. Indeed, the step would be all the more difficult after the Bush administration made it clear today that Mr. Arafat had not done enough to merit a meeting with Mr. Cheney.","2404":"WASHINGTON, March 24\u2014 Federal investigators are examining whether terrorist operations by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda and other Islamic groups were indirectly financed by at least two wealthy, well-connected Saudis through a maze of foundations, companies and financial institutions.","2405":"'It is hard to say what is the bigger threat to him, his allies or the Russians,' said Mr. Kutayev, the former deputy prime minister, who argues that Mr. Maskhadov opposes the extremists in the rebel command whose support comes from Arab and Afghan sources connected to Osama bin Laden.","2406":"In separate interviews, the tribal leaders, Pashtun Muslims, expressed other views the Bush administration would certainly find discouraging: that the core of American policy is a hatred of Muslims and that Osama bin Laden was not responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.","2407":"He sees the world not through one carefully assembled perspective, but through the comic equivalent of a fly's compound eye. He glances simultaneously at show business, news, history, religion, memories, puns, ethnic strife, everyday life and lust, making free-associative leaps with a grand illogic of their own. He suggested, for instance, that as fellow psychopaths, the Unabomber and Charles Manson could be sent after Osama bin Laden. He wondered how American culture might make inroads among Muslims, rejecting ideas like starting up wet burka contests or a kiddie show called 'Saudi Doody.'","2408":"FOR all the sophisticated electronic tools the United States government has at its investigative disposal, tracking the activities of suspected terrorist groups online has proved to be not unlike the search for Osama bin Laden and his operatives on the ground.","2409":"The Justice Department said that it would seek the death penalty for Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person arrested in the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Moussaoui is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda terrorist network.","241":"The campaign against the statues was ordered by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, who declared that they had been worshiped as false gods in the past and, if left standing, might be so venerated again. Previous Taliban decrees have banned women from getting an education or holding jobs, condemning millions of Afghans to poverty and powerlessness. The Taliban also shelter Osama bin Laden, whose terrorist network murders innocent people around the world in a twisted version of Islamic holy war.","2410":"The sad reality is that real moral and political leadership -- an effort to articulate a vision and take risks to persuade people to share it -- comes mostly from Osama bin Laden and other Islamists. Their vision may be harmful, frightening and deceitful, but they have one, and struggle to persuade people to follow them.","2411":"Mr. Moussaoui, who has pleaded not guilty, is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda terrorist network in the attacks.","2412":"In addition, after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Saudis stressed repeatedly that the first step toward ending the terrorism inspired by Osama bin Laden was to solve the Palestinian conflict, which inspires many in the Arab world to take up arms against the United States and its Arab allies.","2413":"One of the suspected Al Qaeda fighters who was captured in Pakistan on Thursday is believed to be Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, American and Pakistani officials said. 12","2415":"WASHINGTON, March 30\u2014 One of the suspected Qaeda fighters who was captured in Pakistan on Thursday is believed to be Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, American and Pakistani officials said today.","2416":"The British role in molding the theater of today's regional conflicts was by no means just military. With World War I under way, Britain and France reached a secret deal to carve up the Middle East. And that deal -- the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 -- was central to the western division of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1920's, a moment that, for radical Islamists like Osama bin Laden, is mourned as the final passing of the Muslim Caliphate that dated to the Prophet Muhammad and reviled as an episode of profound cultural humiliation.","2417":"American and Pakistani officials say they believe that Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, may be among the 30 Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured in Pakistan on Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the most significant apprehension of a Qaeda commander since the United States began its military campaign. Mr. Zubaydah, a 30-year-old Palestinian, has been trying to reorganize the terrorist network for new attacks against the United States, American officials say.","2418":"The Pakistani government has demonstrated how firmly it is in the camp of cooperation, most lately in allowing the F.B.I. and C.I.A. to conduct a raid with Pakistani police here last week that rounded up more than 30 men with suspected links to Al Qaeda. The raid also demonstrated how valuable that cooperation can be: one of those apprehended, Abu Zubaydah, is suspected of being a top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.","2419":"WASHINGTON, March 31\u2014 The man believed to be Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, was seriously wounded when he was captured last week in Pakistan and is now in United States custody at an undisclosed location, American officials said today.","242":"The trial, which will enter its fifth week in Federal District Court tomorrow, concerns the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998. Four men, Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, have been charged with joining forces with Osama bin Laden in a global terrorist conspiracy that eventually led to the attacks, which killed more than 200 people.","2420":"The pilot maneuvered the plane for a close look. Two spotters with high-powered binoculars scoured the sea. Another sat inside the plane's nose, which was made of clear plastic. Minutes passed. Nothing. Then, the man in the nose spotted something. But it was not Osama bin Laden or his men.","2421":"In recent days, government officials in Khost, the provincial capital, have cited reports from witnesses that Osama bin Laden and other senior members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban are operating in the Khost region on both sides of the border.","2422":"When Safouh Hamoui was arrested with his wife and three children in their suburban Seattle home at dawn on March 1, he was asked by F.B.I. agents what he thought about Osama bin Laden and the Sept. 11 terror attacks, according to his lawyer, Bernice Funk.","2423":"A terrible disaster is in the making in the Middle East. What Osama bin Laden failed to achieve on Sept. 11 is now being unleashed by the Israeli-Palestinian war in the West Bank: a clash of civilizations.","2424":"An important lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, Abu Zubaydah, was organizing new attacks on American targets when he was captured in Pakistan last week, officials said. A12","2425":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan, March 27\u2014 In this raucous border town, long a center of men and materi\u00e9l for wars in next-door Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden has fallen out of favor, and at least one industry is thriving on the change.","2426":"The Amman march today was the largest in the capital since Israel activated its intense assault on the West Bank on Friday. The protest included a huge contingent from the Muslim Brotherhood flaunting a picture of Osama bin Laden and chanting in favor of attacking Israel.","2427":"WASHINGTON, April 2\u2014 An important lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, Abu Zubaydah, was organizing new attacks on American targets when he was captured in Pakistan last week, Bush administration officials said today in confirming his arrest.","2428":"The White House said Abu Zubaydah, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden captured last week, had been plotting new attacks. Page A12.","2429":"A man suspected by the government of being a senior aide to Osama bin Laden plans to plead guilty today to charges that he tried to murder a federal jail guard in Manhattan in late 2000, according to people familiar with the case.","243":"The Taliban crave recognition. But instead of acknowledgment from the United Nations, the Taliban have received sanctions, in part as punishment for hospitality given to the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.","2430":"A man suspected by the government of being a senior aide to Osama bin Laden pleaded guilty yesterday to trying to kill a federal jail guard in Manhattan in November 2000. The defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, was scheduled to begin trial on the assault charges later this month. But yesterday, Judge Deborah A. Batts accepted his guilty plea in Federal District Court. Mr. Salim still faces terrorism conspiracy charges relating to the attacks on United States Embassies in Africa in 1998. Those charges are not affected by yesterday's plea, which was expected. Robert F. Worth (NYT)","2431":"But the new information, combined with recent intelligence indicating that Qaeda followers are regrouping in Pakistan and elsewhere, has heightened concern among counterterrorism officials that Osama bin Laden's network is determined to seek out new targets.","2432":"At least 75 people have been detained in a half dozen raids that began on March 27 with the biggest catch of them all, Abu Zubaydah, a top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden. American agents played a lead role in that raid, which seized at least 26 people altogether. Pakistani security officers say Americans have also been present during other raids.","2433":"He added, 'Would we want an organization representing Osama bin Laden having a headquarters here and being protected by our Police Department?'","2434":"Mr. Zubaydah, a 31-year-old Palestinian with close ties to Osama bin Laden, is the first man under American interrogation who likely has a map in his head of sleeper cells and terrorist operations around the world, both recent and those still planned. The head of operations for Al Qaeda and a chief of recruitment and terror training for the group, he almost certainly played a key role in the Sept. 11 attacks and in numerous other plots. His capture was a joint American-Pakistani operation, and Pakistan deserves both thanks and praise. It also deserves help, technical and financial, so that its intelligence and police services can become more efficient. Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, is trying to break the back of the powerful radical Islamist network in his country, although his efforts are far from perfect. The capture of Mr. Zubaydah, like the arrest of the suspected murderers of Daniel Pearl, is a success to be encouraged.","2435":"But then Mr. Merhi rose to introduce Representative Pascrell. Speaking without notes, Mr. Merhi faulted American foreign policy for allowing Osama bin Laden to take root in Afghanistan, and denounced the long detention of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11.","2436":"The poem, 'The Travail of a Child Who Has Left the Land of the Holy Shrines,' was found last fall in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan, once used by Al Qaeda fighters. The three-page printed poem clearly notes its two authors, 'the poet Dr. Abd-ar-Rahman al-Ashmawi' and 'Sheik Osama bin Laden.'","2437":"IT seems safe to class Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in that last category, bent as they are on destruction of what they see as a corrupt and competing civilization. 'I don't see any sort of halfway houses in that sort of rhetoric,' Mr. Fuerth said.","2438":"'Some of the stuff looked pretty old, but the locals said Osama bin Laden had been there,' said Capt. Lou Bauer, 29, of Windsor, N.Y.","2439":"The petitioners represent just some of possibly thousands of civilians who suffered in the campaign against the Taliban leadership and Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, that began exactly six months ago today. Global Exchange, a human rights organization based in San Francisco that is supporting the victims in their claims, estimates that about 2,000 families may have suffered losses in the bombing.","244":"The anti-idol declaration by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's chieftain, ought to be seen for what it is above all else: a crystal-clear signal that Osama bin Laden, the Saudi terrorist who has lived in Afghanistan since 1996, has found a true spiritual brother in the Taliban movement. The Taliban's six-year war of conquest -- to which Mr. bin Laden contributes a small but not insignificant Arab force -- has developed into a brutal fight where no quarter is given to Afghans who oppose Mullah Omar's prophet-like pretensions.","2440":"In a two-hour demonstration that congested traffic for several blocks around the plaza, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was the target of many speakers and placards, some comparing him to Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi who is the leader of the Qaeda terrorist network.","2441":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Sixty Islamic terrorists, trained in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden, are holed up in the town of Biyara in northern Iraq, guests of Saddam Hussein. Their assignment is to infiltrate the no-flight zone and to kill the Kurdish leaders, who Saddam assumes will be allied with the U.S. in his overthrow.","2443":"But in reality, the relationship was always somewhat charged. The Bush administration seemed irritated at Mr. Sharon's repeated equation of Washington's antiterrorism campaign with his war with the Palestinians, comparing Mr. Arafat with Osama bin Laden and the Palestine Liberation Organization with Al Qaeda.","2445":"Although the indictment charges that the Islamic Group has forged alliances with other terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, the terror network led by Osama bin Laden, Mr. Ashcroft said that there was no evidence linking the messages sent by Mr. Abdel Rahman to the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","2446":"In a nearby shop, two buyers sat on the carpet eating lunch with the owner, surrounded by guns. Behind them was a picture of Osama bin Laden.","2447":"Though the Bush administration says the company has secret links to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, its open corporate links were to Citibank for money transfers and to AT&amp;T for international calls, and it was negotiating with Coca-Cola to become a bottler.","2448":"In November, American officials announced that they had proof that the company, Al Barakaat, was providing as much as $25 million a year to Osama bin Laden's terrorists in weapons, cash and other support. With the help of dozens of countries, the Treasury Department froze nearly all the company's assets, paralyzing the biggest employer in one of the poorest countries.","2449":"A raid in Pakistan that turned up a top aide to Osama bin Laden last month suggests that the hunt for Al Qaeda fugitives may prove considerably more complicated than previously expected. PAGE 20","245":"The four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been accused of joining with Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the bombing of the Nairobi embassy and a nearly simultaneous blast that destroyed the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 11 more.","2450":"FAISALABAD, Pakistan, April 9\u2014 This industrial city deep in the interior of Pakistan was never high on the list of places deemed likely to provide sanctuary to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network.","2451":"DEAN KAMEN'S motorized scooter, conceived as Ginger and christened Segway, has sparked the public imagination like few other inventions in recent memory. A New Yorker cover recently featured Osama bin Laden making a getaway on a Segway. Last week, the television character Niles rode one on 'Frasier.'","2452":"'You don't meet with a terrorist,' said Rinat Shigris, 22, a university student. 'The United States should understand that we're both in the same war, and they don't meet with Osama bin Laden.","2453":"'Americans know that Arafat is nothing more than Osama bin Laden with good P.R.,' said Mr. Netanyahu, who is said to be preparing his own bid for re-election in Israel.","2454":"The source of the tape is unclear, and the network would not say how it was obtained. But perhaps even more than the other Qaeda videos that have come to light in recent months, it strongly suggests the responsibility of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in the attacks.","2456":"KHARTOUM, Sudan\u2014 It's a measure of the rage spreading across the Middle East that even in this dusty capital, almost at the edge of the world, several hundred thousand people have marched through the streets denouncing Israel and America -- and in some cases cheering Osama bin Laden.","2457":"A man identified as a Sept. 11 hijacker said in a newly broadcast videotape that his death was meant to send the message that 'it is time to kill the Americans in their own homeland.' Another segment showed Osama bin Laden sitting contemplatively beside his second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. A20","2458":"But while the prosecutors have asserted that the men are part of an international terrorist movement and that all of the defendants received training in Afghanistan, little evidence has yet surfaced that provides a direct connection to Osama bin Laden or his Qaeda network.","2459":"Mr. Bishop left a note that said he was acting alone but supported the efforts of Al Qaeda, the terrorism network. The authorities have said they do not believe that the teenager had ties to terrorists. The note said Osama bin Laden was planning other terrorist acts, including 'blowing up the Super Bowl with an antiquated nuclear bomb left over from the 1967 Israeli-Syrian war.'","246":"The bombings trial concerns the terrorist attacks on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people. Four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been charged in the case, accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a global conspiracy that led to the blasts.","2460":"The United States destroyer Cole, damaged by a terrorist attack in Yemen that left a gaping hole in its side, is ready to return to action after 18 months of repairs that cost $250 million, the Navy said. On Friday, the Cole is scheduled to leave the shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., where the repairs were made, for the Navy base at Norfolk, Va., to be deployed, said Lt. Bill Speaks of the Navy. 'It's completely repaired,' he said. In October 2000, a small boat pulled alongside the destroyer in Aden harbor and blew up, killing 17 American crew members in an attack that the United States suspects was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.","2461":"WASHINGTON, April 17\u2014 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld reaffirmed his support today for the battle plan used to flush Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters last year from the mountains of Tora Bora in Afghanistan, and denied reports that the administration had concluded that Osama bin Laden was there but was able to escape.","2462":"Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld reaffirmed his support for the battle plan used in the mountains of Tora Bora in Afghanistan last year, and he denied reports that officials had concluded that Osama bin Laden was there but had escaped. A14","2463":"So when the current President Bush talked of the war on terrorism after Sept. 11, his reversals, according to Mr. Oates, contained phrases like 'I am avowed, we will get them' and 'Skies, we have seen the limit with terror.' At the same time, Mr. Oates found a more ominous note in the president's speeches. His phrase 'an act of war against our country,' when played backward, revealed the phrase 'Rule the planet.' Meanwhile, in a speech by Osama bin Laden, one of Mr. Oates's students discovered the reversal, 'Our government is wrong; terror now.'","2464":"Danny and I both wished we had been visiting Pakistan in a quieter time. But there we were. At our first meeting we heard from a group of women who advised the city of Karachi. They expressed anger at Western reporters for blaming the attacks on Muslim fundamentalists and Osama bin Laden without proof. They asked us to think carefully about our responsibilities as Westerners and as journalists. They said they were lovers of peace and were deeply offended by what they perceived as the West's attack on Islam.","2465":"Even so, there were growing suggestions that the man who received the telephone call had ties to Al Qaeda. The German television network ZDF as well as a Berlin newspaper reported today that a police search of the man's apartment had uncovered a phone number for a top suspect in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, Ramzi Muhammad Abdullah bin al-Shibh. Mr. Shibh was a close acquaintance of Mohamed Atta and other hijackers based in Hamburg. He tried to enter the United States, but was refused a visa because of his suspected links to Osama bin Laden. American investigators believe that he was to have been the 20th member of the hijacking team, and did in fact serve as a financial director by wiring money to members of the group.","2466":"Government officials said Mr. Zubaydah's statements after his capture this month in Pakistan were among several recent signs that Osama bin Laden's group might be gearing up for further attacks at home and overseas.","2467":"Al Rashid typifies the organizations cited in previous freeze orders, many of them Muslim-related charities or cultural organizations, although orders have also applied to some ordinary businesses that federal investigators say have helped Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2468":"Literature can rarely match everyday news of the world for horror and pain, but Sade provided us with illuminating tableaux vivants -- 18th-century close-ups of the action. In reading his work we find an echo of the eerie, opaque feeling many of us experienced watching the tape of Osama bin Laden and his friends cheerfully recalling the handiwork in the World Trade Center attacks. Why the opacity? And what is the powerful discomfort about?","2469":"AT a cheap Peruvian restaurant in Brooklyn, David Rees was telling a story, and it involved: a 1980's punk band called the Minutemen, America, Lenny Bruce, Vanity Fair magazine, Osama bin Laden and Mr. Rees's very funny, very profane online comic strip, 'Get Your War On.'","247":"Mr. Meskini's guilty plea on Wednesday, which was reported yesterday in The Washington Post, occurred before Judge Loretta A. Preska in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the same place where four men are now on trial, facing charges that they joined with Osama bin Laden in a global conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","2470":"The alleged plot against the former king would not be the first; it also would not be the first time people posing as journalists tried to assassinate an Afghan political leader. In September, two men claiming to be television reporters detonated a bomb hidden inside a camera, killing Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the anti-Taliban resistance. American officials have said that that plot appeared to be orchestrated by Osama bin Laden in the days before the Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center.","2472":"New analysis of a videotape showing Osama bin Laden has concluded that the Al Qaeda terrorist network -- badly damaged during the war in Afghanistan -- is in the process of reconstituting itself.","2473":"Both defendants had seemed intent on provoking New Yorkers. One man told a crowd in Times Square a few days after Sept. 11 that 'more cops and firemen should have died.' The other, carrying a picture of Osama bin Laden, shouted near the World Trade Center ruins in early October that the attacks had been revenge against Americans.","2474":"'Osama bin Laden does not represent Palestine,' he said. 'If anyone wants to help our cause, they should come here and help us fight Israel. They should not go out and kill civilians around the world.'","2475":"With his remarks, Mr. Moussaoui, who lived for several years in Britain and proved himself today to be well versed in American legal jargon, embraced the government's description of him as a Muslim extremist who supported Osama bin Laden's call for the destruction of the United States.","2476":"One official said Mr. Zubaydah, believed to be Osama bin Laden's operations chief, 'is well positioned to know what Al Qaeda has been up to, and we have to take his information seriously.'","2477":"Another of Mr. Fortuyn's pitches -- that immigrants should accept the customs and learn the language of the countries that receive them -- also echoes the views of voters in other European countries, notably France and Britain as well as Germany, where people were stunned to discover that Islamic extremists linked to Osama bin Laden were operating with apparent impunity before Sept. 11.","2479":"'I admit to plotting to blow up a Jewish synagogue in France,' Mr. Beandali said, in a statement that his lawyer read in the courtroom this afternoon. But, he insisted repeatedly, he had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden or the Qaeda network. Nor, he insisted, did he ever want to injure or kill innocent people.","248":"The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, may be able to tell the Taliban directly of his concern about the fate of the two large Buddha statues at Bamiyan, which Islamic zealots in Afghanistan say they intend to destroy. Mystery hangs over the statues' fate: the Taliban have not allowed outsiders to travel to the town, a two-day drive to the west of Kabul. Mr. Annan may meet Taliban officials in Pakistan, the first stop on a 10-day trip, where he may also discuss the future of the fugitive sponsor of terrorism, Osama bin Laden. Barbara Crossette","2480":"The London-based dailies Al Quds Al Arabi and Al Hayat said they had received a claim of responsibility from a group calling itself the Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Holy Sites. A group calling itself by the same name claimed responsibility for the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which more than 200 people were killed and which American authorities blamed on Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network.","2481":"Nangahar Province includes Tora Bora, the mountainous area where Osama bin Laden was last thought to be.

Matty knows who Osama bin Laden is and Emma asks if Arafat is a bad man.'","2483":"Mr. Ansary, a California writer and editor, has put this and much else into 'West of Kabul, East of New York,' a book that steadies our skittering compass. Pointing east and west it signals not galactic opposites but two ends of a needle we can hold in our hand. Mr. Ansari loathes Osama bin Laden and fears what he stands for, something lucidly set out at the end. But it is part of himself that our bombs hit, as well. No windy feeling, this, but as homely as his reaction to a talk-show caller who suggested nuking:","2484":"WASHINGTON, April 25\u2014 American officials said today that they had verified the accuracy of some of the information provided by a captured senior leader of Al Qaeda, and expressed cautious optimism that he would eventually divulge more detailed information about the terrorist network and the whereabouts of its surviving leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","2485":"'The names of the groups are not important,' said Rolf Tophoven, an analyst in Bonn and author of numerous books on terrorism. 'We have to assume today that not all terrorism comes from Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda provided the impulse, but you have isolated groups around the world that do not require a command from Iraq and do not have to be steered by Osama bin Laden. There are often links, but this is a very loose grouping.'","2486":"Both Russian and some American officials say Khattab has links to Osama bin Laden, and the rebel leader is widely said to have set up training camps in the Chechen highlands for guerrillas and explosive experts from a number of nations.","2487":"But the fear is that some of the very warlords likely to disrupt the loya jirga process, or to try to control it through bribery and intimidation, are allied with American military forces in their campaign to find Osama bin Laden. If foreign money makes its way into the selection procedures, that, too, follows Afghan tradition. Few experts doubt that Russia, Iran and maybe Pakistan are players behind the scenes.","2488":"But others at the State Department and the White House argue that efforts to topple Mr. Hussein would be viewed by Arabs as a confrontation with Islam, destabilizing the region and complicating the broader campaign against Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.","249":"Relations between the United Nations and the Taliban have never been good, and they have worsened with fresh sanctions imposed in January to press for the extradition of Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of organizing terror attacks against American targets and has been given asylum by the Taliban.","2490":"Mr. Zadran, a recipient of such support, has been quick to point out suspected members of Al Qaeda, so much so that some here believe he simply identifies all his political foes as associates of Osama bin Laden.","2491":"The government of President Eduard A. Shevardnadze has been unable to establish control over the Pankisi Gorge near Chechnya, where armed men -- some thought to have links with Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network -- have found refuge, American officials said.","2492":"WASHINGTON, April 30\u2014 The Justice Department arrested the head of an Islamic charity in Illinois today and said there was extensive evidence that he and his organization had close ties to Osama bin Laden and had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","2493":"Mr. Moussaoui is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network in the Sept. 11 attacks. The case against him appears to rely largely on the similarities between his actions over the last year -- he sought flight training and is reported to have received money from Al Qaeda -- and those of the 19 hijackers.","2494":"Federal agents in Illinois arrested an Islamic charity's director, saying the Benevolence International Foundation had ties to Osama bin Laden and funneled money to Al Qaeda.

Enaam M. Arnaout, 39, the Syrian-born director of the Benevolence International Foundation, was charged with lying under oath.","2496":"The government has said that the search of the apartment turned up several computer-generated photographs of Osama bin Laden, and that a box cutter was found in his car.","2497":"The Justice Department made public information tying a wealthy Saudi businessman, Mohamad Jamal Khalifa, who is Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, to people convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terror plots and to a Chicago-based Islamic charity. A23","2498":"In supporting its arrest of the leader of an Islamic charity this week, the Justice Department has made public new information tying a wealthy Saudi businessman, who is Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, to several people convicted in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 or in unsuccessful plots to bring down airliners and assassinate the pope.","2499":"In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Washington has repeatedly pressed Indonesia, where a shaky economic and democratic transition is under way, to take firmer action against groups and individuals suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden and his terrorism network, Al Qaeda.","25":"AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 16\u2014 A military prosecutor has indicted 13 suspects on charges of terrorism linked to the activities of Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist mastermind, government officials said today.","250":"Mr. Ressam, who prosecutors suspect is connected to the terrorist network believed to be headed by Osama bin Laden, is accused of entering Washington State aboard a ferry from Canada with a car loaded with bomb-making materials.","2500":"As hundreds more coalition troops have been sent into the rolling hills and craggy mountains of eastern Afghanistan, an Afghan intelligence official said Osama bin Laden himself had been spotted twice in recent weeks just over the border in the tribal areas of Pakistan. In Washington, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld discounted such reports.","2501":"The Justice Department made public information tying a wealthy Saudi businessman, Mohamad Jamal Khalifa, who is Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, to people convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terror plots and to a Chicago-based Islamic charity. A23","2502":"It's quite a task; a poll last fall found that 82 percent of urban Pakistanis regard Osama bin Laden as a freedom fighter. Pakistan's intelligence agency is responsible for more terrorist killings than Al Qaeda. The country has been on the edge of bankruptcy, 55 percent of adults are illiterate, 10 percent of children die by the age of 5, and there are more drug addicts than college graduates.","2503":"Imagine a team sent to investigate American military action in Afghanistan without reference to the attacks of Sept. 11 or Osama bin Laden's boasts that he would destroy America. And imagine asking that investigation to ignore the sanctuary the Taliban gave Mr. bin Laden and his Qaeda operatives despite previous American warnings.","2504":"A U.S. diplomat in Jakarta told me she had just visited the town of Malang, in East Java, and had seen an Indonesian boy there wearing an Osama bin Laden T-shirt and a New York Yankees cap. So all isn't lost. But we must make sure that he grows into the hat, not the T-shirt.","2505":"The Taliban banned poppy growing under American pressure two summers ago, in an effort to win an easing of stifling economic sanctions that had been imposed because of its harboring of Osama bin Laden. But Ghanikhel kept on trading, and while its supplies dwindled, its prices shot up.","2506":"What is not lost on those building this strategy is the continuing search on both sides of the rugged border area for their most notorious quarry, Osama bin Laden. 'If there's a large pocket left in that tribal area, bin Laden is most likely in it,' a senior military officer said. But he added that American officials had no firm intelligence on Mr. bin Laden's precise whereabouts.","2507":"Indeed, finding someone here who has actually seen an American soldier is almost as hard as finding Osama bin Laden himself.","2508":"But Osama bin Laden's tricycle was probably gold-plated, and we all know that the 9/11 hijackers came from privileged backgrounds. Look at ETA in Spain, Red Brigades in Italy, Aum Shinrikyo in Japan, the I.R.A. in Ireland or Timothy McVeigh: they suggest middle-class alienation rather than third-world deprivation.","2509":"Pentagon officials have privately acknowledged that they probably missed their best opportunity of the war to catch the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, by relying too heavily on Afghan allies to encircle Tora Bora while American and other coalition Special Operations forces hunted for adversaries. Mr. bin Laden is believed to have slipped into Pakistan on one of the many trails that lace the region.","251":"But from the opening arguments in court here, it was unclear just how far the prosecutors would go to prove that the defendant, Ahmed Ressam, 33, planned to blow up West Coast airports and downtown areas, as they have charged, at the behest of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi suspected of orchestrating a series of international terrorist acts.","2510":"The first time I saw Reno's 'Rebel Without a Pause' exactly five weeks had passed since Sept. 11. We were all still pretty shaky, and the idea of turning the World Trade Center disaster into humor was questionable. (Well, you could ridicule Osama bin Laden at that point, but that was all.)","2511":"Canadian troops and American criminal investigators have exhumed 23 bodies from a grave site in the Tora Bora mountains that they suspect are remains of Al Qaeda fighters, perhaps a security contingent for Osama bin Laden.

Rather, it's that despite the buzz of activity -- such as doffing our shoes at airports -- we as a nation can't seem to get ahead of the curve in avoiding the next catastrophe, by taking steps such as controlling loose nukes, learning how to decontaminate after anthrax attacks, examining checked baggage, checking shipping containers and reducing the risk from states like Iraq or North Korea.","2514":"In his complaint, Mr. Wright said the funds were linked to Yassin Qadi, a Saudi businessman, whom the federal government designated last October as a financial supporter of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Qadi has denied links to terrorists.","2515":"A 33-year-old Muslim fundamentalist, Mr. Moussaoui is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, in the attacks, but prosecutors have released no evidence tying him directly to the 19 suicide hijackers.","2516":"While the documentary focuses on a family's loss, the boys' experiment is a reminder of how dramatically our view of the world has changed since that day. Not nearly as many people in this country would mistake Poland for Afghanistan now, nor would they be at a loss to name Osama bin Laden as the terrorist leader. Much of that instant education came from television, which in the early days provided both news and comfort. Then followed explication, in an onslaught of documentaries. The broadcast networks and cable channels have covered the rise of terrorism, the roots of Islam, the sociology of Afghanistan, the structural history of the World Trade Center and even the fate of pets living at ground zero (an Animal Planet production).","2517":"Canadian troops and U.S. investigators found what might be the graves of a security unit for Osama bin Laden killed in a Dec. 15 airstrike in Tora Bora. They unearthed 23 bodies and took DNA samples.","2518":"LONDON, May 11\u2014 A British judge ruled on Friday that an Algerian accused of being the leader of a London-based Al Qaeda cell and of plotting with Osama bin Laden to blow up Los Angeles International Airport on the eve of the millennium celebrations should be extradited to the United States.","2519":"A British judge ruled that an Algerian accused of being the leader of a London-based Qaeda cell and of plotting with Osama bin Laden to blow up Los Angeles International Airport should be extradited to the United States. 11","252":"The bombings trial, now being heard in Federal District Court in Manhattan, concerns both of these bloody attacks, which occurred miles apart but nearly simultaneously, resulting in 224 deaths. Four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been charged in the case, accused of joining with Osama bin Laden in an international terrorist conspiracy that eventually led to the assaults. Mr. Mohamed was charged with riding in the truck that took the bomb to the embassy in Dar es Salaam. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.","2520":"That was not the case just after Sept. 11, when the administration privately rebuked Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for trying to equate Yasir Arafat with Osama bin Laden, head of the terrorist network linked to the attacks.","2521":"CHICAGO, May 13\u2014 A judge refused today to dismiss perjury charges against an Islamic charity and its director accused of lying about ties to Osama bin Laden and his network.","2523":"Before Sept. 11 few people in the United States had heard of Al Jazeera, the Arabic-language satellite channel that instantly became infamous with its broadcasts of Osama bin Laden.","2524":"Senior Indian officials say the Americans are not doing enough to pressure Pakistan to crack down on the militants, perhaps because the United States is so reliant on General Musharraf for help in hunting for Osama bin Laden and his followers. They are regularly galled when American officials praise the general for the steps he has taken against Islamic extremists.","2525":"The same is true inside the Bush administration. The State Department sees the Mideast war as a war over Israel's 1967 boundaries, and its focus is 'conflict resolution' -- diplomacy aimed at getting Israel to trade occupied land for peace. But over at the Pentagon, the view is that Yasir Arafat is no different from Osama bin Laden, and the other Arab leaders are worthy only of contempt. The Pentagon sees the Israeli war to crush Mr. Arafat as an extension of the U.S. war on terrorism and believes that the most you can do with Arabs and Israelis today is 'conflict management,' not conflict resolution.","2526":"WASHINGTON, May 14\u2014 The classified memorandum written by an F.B.I. agent in Phoenix last summer urging bureau headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools also cited Osama bin Laden by name and suggested that his followers could use the schools to train for terror operations, government officials said for the first time today.","2527":"The films are shot in scrambled order, which intensifies their eerie timelessness. Every 'new' 'Star Wars' movie is a preprogrammed march toward the incompetent cyborg fascism of Darth Vader. It's hard to imagine how the series will ever manage without Vader -- it would be like Milton without Satan -- but in 2002, Obi-Wan Kenobi has finally come into his own as an iconic figure. A bearded, slippery mystic hiding in the desert: old Ben Kenobi could be mistaken for Osama bin Laden. Maybe he could be pressed into service as the new Dark Side of the Force.","2528":"The classified memo written by an F.B.I. agent in Phoenix last summer, urging headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools, cited Osama bin Laden by name and suggested his followers might use the schools to train for terror operations.

The reason, Ms. Tucker said, is 'primarily because of Ms. White's involvement' in the case of Osama bin Laden, suspected of orchestrating terrorist acts, and not because of her office's investigation into the pardons issued by Mr. Clinton.","2530":"WASHINGTON, May 15\u2014 The White House said tonight that President Bush had been warned by American intelligence agencies in early August that Osama bin Laden was seeking to hijack aircraft but that the warnings did not contemplate the possibility that the hijackers would turn the planes into guided missiles for a terrorist attack.","2531":"The White House said that President Bush was warned by intelligence agencies last August that Osama bin Laden was seeking to hijack aircraft but that the reports did not include the possibility that the hijackers would turn the planes into guided missiles for terror attacks. A1","2532":"Relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks had a variety of reactions yesterday to news that President Bush had been warned that followers of Osama bin Laden might hijack American planes. Mostly, their concerns centered on how the country could protect itself against future terrorist attacks, so others did not have to experience their grief.","2533":"The story line of the Sept. 11 terror attacks would unquestionably be a lot tidier if we knew that President Bush had been warned about possible strikes and done nothing to prevent them. That's why Washington is buzzing about the disclosure that the Central Intelligence Agency told Mr. Bush early last August that Osama bin Laden might try to hijack airplanes. But tragedies of the magnitude of Sept. 11 are rarely so neatly explained. Until someone produces evidence that the Bush administration received and ignored information pointing directly to the suicide hijackings, the country will have to live with the much messier and no less disturbing fact that the government as a whole dropped the ball and even now is not doing nearly enough to ensure that it doesn't happen again.","2534":"The White House, moving to contain political damage from its disclosure that the C.I.A. told President Bush in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking, said the assessment was contained in an 'analytic report' that was not based on specific intelligence that terrorists were planning the Sept. 11 attacks. A1","2535":"WASHINGTON, May 16\u2014 Confronting a political uproar over its disclosure that President Bush was cautioned last August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking, the White House said today that the assessment was in a C.I.A. analysis that was not based on specific intelligence of any pending attack.","2536":"The general idea that Osama bin Laden might attack American airlines had been public for months. The aviation agency publishes an annual report called Criminal Acts Against Aviation, and the 2000 edition, published on the agency's Web site in 2001, said that although Mr. bin Laden 'is not known to have attacked civil aviation, he has both the motivation and the wherewithal to do so.'","2538":"The sharp questions about possible intelligence lapses and about the vigor of the administration's response to terrorist warnings came a day after the White House announced, eight months after the terror attacks, that President Bush had been alerted by the Central Intelligence Agency last summer to the danger of hijackings by terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden.","2539":"WASHINGTON, May 17\u2014 The White House began an aggressive attack on Democrats in Congress today as President Bush tried to contain the political fury over a warning he received last August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking.","254":"Mr. Mohamed has been charged with playing a direct role in the carnage and chaos that was depicted on the screen just inches from his face. He has been accused of riding in the truck that carried the bomb and of joining three other men in a terrorist plot with Osama bin Laden that resulted in the bombings of the United States Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998.","2540":"The White House assailed Congressional Democrats who it said were trying to exploit politically the furor over a warning given President Bush in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. Democrats were taken aback by the intensity of the Republican offensive. A1","2541":"Qaeda and Islamic extremists had already tried to destroy the World Trade Center towers in 1993. Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and others had designs to destroy infrastructure like New York's Lincoln Tunnel. Qaeda terrorists had killed hundreds in the 1998 attacks against American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. On the eve of the millennium, an operative linked to Osama bin Laden, Ahmed Ressam, tried to sneak into the United States to bomb Los Angeles International Airport. And a Qaeda affiliate, Ramzi Yousef, had developed plans to blow up a dozen American jumbo jets in the mid-1990's. By the late 1990's, intelligence services should have recognized that Qaeda hijackers would be likely to kill everyone on board any plane they seized.","2542":"The White House reacted with anger today at the criticism from several prominent Democrats after the disclosure on Wednesday that President Bush was informed on Aug. 6 that Osama bin Laden's terror network might be planning jet hijackings. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said that any Congressional inquiry should be 'free from politics.'","2543":"The White House learned in February 2001 that Osama bin Laden had discussed hijacking a Pakistani airliner with the son of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman at a meeting earlier that year in Afghanistan, according to current and former administration officials.","2544":"An Arabic-language newspaper also reported today that it had received recorded statements said to be from the fugitive Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. He is reported to have said that Osama bin Laden is alive, that the war in Afghanistan is not over and that American forces in Afghanistan will suffer 'fire, hell and total defeat.'","2545":"Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, says that despite last summer's warnings that terrorists linked to Osama bin Laden were planning major attacks and airplane hijackings, 'I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center' (front page, May 17).","2546":"WASHINGTON, May 17\u2014 The F.B.I. had been aware for several years that Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network were training pilots in the United States and elsewhere around the world, according to court records and interviews at flight schools and with federal law enforcement officials.","2547":"Last week, Democrats in Congress pounced on a disclosure that President Bush was cautioned last August -- the month before the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York and Washington -- that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. The White House responded that the warnings weren't based on specific intelligence, and Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said, 'I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile.'","2548":"First, there were new details about an F.B.I. memo written last summer, in which an agent urged an inquiry into the Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools. For the first time, government officials said that the memo mentioned Osama bin Laden and suggested his followers might use the flight schools to train for terrorist operations. Then the White House announced, in response to a CBS News report, that intelligence agencies had warned President Bush in August that Mr. bin Laden was seeking to hijack jets.","2549":"The death of Mr. Basra is a reminder that in this part of the world terrorism is not limited to Osama bin Laden. Pakistan and its neighbors crawl with groups like Mr. Basra's Lashkar-i-Jangvi. But they have usually reserved their wrath for fellow Muslims, and have not become well known in the West.","255":"MR. STARR believes the United States should use this moment to rethink its policies in all of Central and South Asia. Afghanistan's collapse is poisoning a wide region through the export of terrorism, the closing of trade routes and narcotics, he said, and American policy reinforces the Taliban's isolation. They now cannot hold a United Nations seat and are, unlike their enemies, under an arms embargo. When they slashed opium cultivation last year, there were no rewards, only more isolation, because they would not turn over Osama bin Laden.","2550":"The failure to prevent Sept. 11 was not a failure of intelligence or coordination. It was a failure of imagination. Even if all the raw intelligence signals had been shared among the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the White House, I'm convinced that there was no one there who would have put them all together, who would have imagined evil on the scale Osama bin Laden did.","2551":"The F.B.I. man figured out that Osama bin Laden might have dispatched followers to flight schools in Arizona and elsewhere to train them for a coordinated terrorist operation that would infiltrate our airlines.","2552":"Last week, Democrats in Congress pounced on a disclosure that President Bush was cautioned last August -- the month before the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York and Washington -- that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. The White House responded that the warnings weren't based on specific intelligence, and Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said, 'I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile.'","2553":"LONDON, May 19\u2014 A British-based Islamic news agency released a videotape today of Osama bin Laden that it said was filmed just two months ago. But the independent Arab satellite news network Al Jazeera said it had seen the tape three or four months ago and believed it was recorded in October.","2554":"This harsh southern province, a place of bare mountains and sun-baked valleys, is where most of the Taliban's leaders were born and brought up. While Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda followers appear to have moved eastward toward the Pakistan border after the collapse of the Taliban's government, Mullah Omar is thought to have taken to the mountains north of Kandahar where the mujahedeen survived for years fighting the Soviet Army.","2555":"WASHINGTON, May 20\u2014 Attorney General John Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, were told a few days after the Sept. 11 attacks that the F.B.I. had received a memorandum from its Phoenix office the previous July warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools, government officials said today.","2556":"With old and new warnings of terror attacks whizzing around Washington, it's becoming hard to follow what really matters, which is preventing another assault by Osama bin Laden and his followers. There's a place for debate about issues like whether Congressional committees or a special commission should investigate the government's response to terrorism before Sept. 11. But there is a danger that talk will become a substitute for action on the problems that desperately need fixing. That includes the performance of agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and even the Social Security Administration, which routinely assigns Social Security numbers to foreigners who submit fake documents.","2557":"The report said that the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya appeared to have curtailed its support for groups with links to terrorist activities, while Sudan had arrested groups tied to terrorism. Sudan provided harbor for years for Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network, and elements of Al Qaeda are reported to continue to use the east African nation as a base, although not with active government support.","2558":"No, it's not over. And yes, I too will say for the record that sometime, somewhere, there will be another attack. But in the meantime we've actually accomplished a lot. If Osama bin Laden is alive, a big if, his ability to direct acts of terrorism against U.S. targets has been disrupted. It is doubtful that he would dare even use a telephone.","2559":"Mullah Omar, Afghanistan's former leader, is one of the world's most wanted men, since he gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network in 1996 and allowed him to operate and acquire enormous power and influence in the country. Mullah Omar is widely reported to be hiding in his home province since fleeing Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual center, in December.","256":"Mr. Rahmatullah is in the United States on a mission to improve ties and ease the Taliban's isolation. A main focus of his visit, he said, will be to find a way out of the impasse surrounding Osama bin Laden, the terrorist suspect whose presence in Afghanistan has prompted international sanctions.","2560":"The threat of a war that would jeopardize the American hunt for Osama bin Laden is India's leverage to get Washington to pay attention to what is sees as Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism against India.","2561":"But they said the request failed to unearth the F.B.I. memorandum warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools.","2562":"Unlike Hamas and other terrorist groups whose actions are consistent, predictable and who quickly claim responsibility, Osama bin Laden relies heavily upon his elusiveness. This may be one of his most effective weapons.","2563":"The issue of whether the bureau missed possible warning signals before Sept. 11 has dominated Washington this week, as members of Congress have conducted closed briefings with an agent in the bureau's Phoenix office who wrote a memorandum last July warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools.","2564":"In the weeks before Sept. 11, a 38-year veteran of Pakistan's nuclear program, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, was discovered to have visited with Osama bin Laden at least twice in Afghanistan, where the two are reported to have discussed nuclear weapons.","2565":"That's history, and no amount of spin from either Bush or Clinton apologists is going to rewrite it. That's also why the question of what the president knew about terrorism on Sept. 11, though important, is hardly the most pressing now, Washington hysteria notwithstanding. Nearly nine months have passed since the day that was supposed to change everything, and Osama bin Laden and most of his top associates, Mullah Omar included, have not been found, dead or alive. The most important question is not how ready we were to fight terrorism on Sept. 11, 2001, but how ready we are to do so as of Memorial Day weekend 2002.","2566":"In her letter, Ms. Rowley criticizes assertions by F.B.I. leaders that the bureau's failure to act on the Moussaoui case and other clues last summer did not make a difference in preventing the attacks. She said that if the same officials at F.B.I. headquarters who handled the search warrant request from the Minneapolis office had been aware of a July memo from an agent in the F.B.I.'s Phoenix office warning that terrorists connected with Osama bin Laden might be trying to go to American flight schools, the Moussaoui case would have been handled differently.","2567":"But officials who have reviewed the July memorandum said that rather than having Mr. Hanjour in his sights, Mr. Williams was focused on a handful of other flight students, including some with ties to a radical British group called Al Muhajiroun, which has stridently supported Osama bin Laden and other terrorists.","2568":"Effectively defending the United States against terrorism requires a full and unflinching understanding of the governmental failures that left the nation so vulnerable to attack on Sept. 11. As evidence mounts of monumental ineptitude and bureaucratic bumbling by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies, it has become obvious that the job exceeds the grasp of the narrowly focused and poorly managed House and Senate intelligence committees. President Bush and Congress should move immediately to establish an independent investigative commission with the authority, expertise and financial support necessary to determine why Washington failed to recognize that Osama bin Laden was on the hunt in America last summer.","2569":"Eight and a half months into the war, the biggest achievement is that the Taliban has been routed in Afghanistan, and the United Nations is trying to install something resembling a real government there. That may or may not prove beneficial for the long-suffering Afghan people. The problem is that this is not why the United States went into Afghanistan. The target of the operation, Osama bin Laden, is still at large, and his Qaeda network has been battered and disrupted, but not crushed. So more attacks remained a distinct and dismaying possibility, as the Bush administration's warnings made clear last week.","257":"For instance, Agent Perkins testified that Mr. Mohamed was not a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, the international organization run by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who has been charged with masterminding the attack. Mr. Mohamed and his co-defendants -- Wadih El-Hage, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been accused of joining with Mr. bin Laden in a global conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998.","2570":"To keep its message to the American public simple, the Bush administration has lumped all of these places into a pot with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network. But many indigenous anti-American movements are growing because of the war on terror.","2571":"WASHINGTON, May 25\u2014 Ask Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld about hunting for Osama bin Laden, and the subject invariably turns to poultry.","2572":"Surely by the morning of Sept. 12, however, when we were begging Muslim societies to help hunt Osama bin Laden, no go-it-aloner would deny Nye's point. He duly amended his manuscript and even says that the attacks on New York and Washington sounded his alarm 'far more effectively than any pen could.' But he responds only weakly to his own challenge that 'we still need to determine how to use the current decades of our pre-eminence to advance long-term national and global interests.'","2574":"WASHINGTON\u2014 It's not surprising that many officials in Washington are talking about convening an independent panel to investigate the federal government's actions before the Sept. 11 attacks. We now know that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was warned by an agent in its Phoenix office in July 2001 that operatives of Osama bin Laden could be studying at American flight schools and yet President Bush was not told until recently about the warning. We also know that Mr. Bush was shown a daily intelligence report in August 2001 indicating that Qaeda members were threatening to hijack American planes, but we do not know much about its context. Given these revelations, we will see various investigations -- within the F.B.I. and other agencies, by Congress, and perhaps even by a blue-ribbon commission of the kind appointed by Lyndon Johnson to study the John F. Kennedy assassination and by Ronald Reagan to study the Challenger disaster. It's a sign of our democracy's health that Americans tend to question government even during national crises; a half-dozen Congressional, military and other panels investigated Pearl Harbor while Americans were still dying in World War II.","2575":"In early 1994, Osama bin Laden spent three months in London, where he visited supporters and bankers and went to watch the famous soccer club Arsenal four times. Before returning to Sudan just a step ahead of being extradited to Saudi Arabia, he bought his sons gifts from the club's souvenir shop. His affection for the game did not stop him from getting involved in a plot to massacre the American and British teams at the 1998 World Cup in France; still, bin Laden told friends he had never seen passion like that of soccer fans.","2576":"Though the Caliphate has not been linked explicitly to Al Qaeda, German authorities have said that the group sent a delegation to meet with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan the year before their planned attack on Ataturk's mausoleum.","2578":"But it was on that morning, not long after his four-mile run, that Mr. Bush sat down in his ranch house for his daily intelligence briefing. It was delivered not by his usual briefer, George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, but by a low-level C.I.A. officer. At some point, the briefer told Mr. Bush that Osama bin Laden's followers in Al Qaeda might hijack commercial jets in the United States -- a dated fragment of information based on a single 1999 British intelligence report.","2579":"There have been reports from Pakistan that Osama bin Laden, the head of Al Qaeda, has been seen in the tribal areas as recently as last month. But General Hagenbeck said he had no solid information on the whereabouts of Mr. bin Laden or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader.","258":"The arrest of Mr. al Nalfi is apparently a breakthrough for the government in its efforts to round up what it says are terrorists led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Mr. al Nalfi's arrest in November came before the beginning of the embassy bombings trial now under way in Federal District Court in Manhattan.","2580":"An F.B.I. investigation two years ago that was apparently linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network was hampered by problems with the bureau's e-mail wiretap system.","2581":"Last October, on the day the American bombings began in Afghanistan, President Musharraf replaced the former head of the spy agency, General Mehmood Ahmed who, according to diplomats and Pakistani intelligence experts, had grown so close to the Taliban government that he urged its chief, Mullah Muhammad Omar, to resist any demands to hand over Osama bin Laden.","2582":"Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a persistent critic of the bureau, said he was unsure if the changes Mr. Mueller was said to be planning would accomplish the goal of 'changing the agency from one that goes after Bonnie and Clyde to one that directs its attention to the likes of Osama bin Laden.'","2583":"Senior officials said today that Mr. Ashcroft's new guidelines addressed some of Ms. Rowley's complaints. Ms. Rowley, general counsel in the Minneapolis office, also complained that agents there had no idea that an agent in Phoenix wrote in a memorandum to headquarters in July that Arab men, possibly connected to Osama bin Laden, had trained at a flight school in Arizona.","2584":"Now shift from reactive to proactive orientation. In my own mind, the bureau has done a superb job -- and particularly the New York office -- in investigating Osama bin Laden, particularly the World Trade Center, where defendants were prosecuted effectively in New York City, and are spending life terms in jail. The defendants who were prosecuted for the 1998 embassy bombings, convicted -- many of them spending life in jail. The F.B.I. has done a terrific job in putting those cases together. What we need to do better is be predictive. We have to be proactive. We have to develop the capability to anticipate attacks. We have to develop the capability of looking around corners. And that is the change. That is the shift in focus particularly at headquarters. No longer can we be a traffic cop sending E.C.'s here, E.C.'s there -- E.C., electronic communications. But we have to take a management and a responsibility role for assuring that the investigations are going well, and that we are gathering and getting the intelligence we need to prevent additional attacks.","2585":"But that stance became increasingly untenable in recent weeks after news reports that two F.B.I. field offices might have had important pieces of information that were never connected by officials at headquarters. Agent Kenneth Williams of the Phoenix office sent a memo on July 10 warning that Osama bin Laden might be sending operatives to American aviation schools to prepare for terrorist operations.","2586":"Timeliness in a play is not generally something to complain about, but 'One Shot, One Kill' by Richard Vetere at Primary Stages takes unsavory advantage of our current concern for national defense. It may not even be deliberate; I don't know whether the play was written before or after Sept. 11. The references to Osama bin Laden and the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon might be recent addenda. But in any case this is a moment when the sacrifices made by men and women for their country loom unassailable, and our sympathy for those who are willing to serve America ahead of their families, themselves or their consciences is fervent and instantaneous.","2587":"One indicator of the paralytic fear of risk-taking was how F.B.I. headquarters responded to the memorandum written last July by an agent from Phoenix. The agent, Kenneth J. Williams, urged a broad survey of American aviation schools based on his concern that Middle Eastern men, possibly connected to Osama bin Laden, were training at a flight school in Arizona.","2588":"The president should snap out of his jet lag, summon his national security team (Tenet and Rove) and issue a single remorseless instruction: 'Bring me the head of Osama bin Laden. Or Bob Mueller.'","2589":"A few years ago, Mr. Asharaf would have voted -- had any such vote been held -- to unite mostly Muslim Kashmir with Pakistan. But no longer. He said the turning point was when Pakistanis and Afghans who had been trained in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, which were run by Osama bin Laden, effectively took over what had been an indigenous Kashmiri guerrilla army.","2590":"The video clip for 'Without You' makes Eminem a one-man cable service, placing him on talk shows, reality shows and a news channel (ENN) that depicts him holed up in a cave dressed as Osama bin Laden (to be attacked by members of Eminem's occasional hip-hop collective, D12). In a sketchy plot line, the clip shows Eminem, costumed like Robin, and his mentor, Dr. Dre, behind the wheel of the Rapmobile, parodying another media franchise, 'Batman.' On the album, 'Business' repeats the Batman bit for an entire song. Eminem invoked another movie franchise on his 2001 European tour when he arrived onstage wearing a hockey mask like Jason from 'Friday the 13th.'","2591":"Essam Al Ridi, an Egyptian-American pilot, has seen Osama bin Laden and his world of militant Islam up close, and he is one of the few people who helped prosecutors penetrate it long before Sept. 11.","2592":"'That guy -- surely we would have to kill him,' Mr. Oltetia, the village's chief warrior, said of Osama bin Laden. 'We as the Masai have ways to kill, just using a spear and bows and arrows.'","2593":"In this remote mountainous region abutting Afghanistan, religious fundamentalism has long flourished and heavily armed tribesmen, rather than the central government, have always defined the law. The United States suspects that these dusty badlands are the redoubt of the remnants of the Taliban, Al Qaeda and perhaps Osama bin Laden himself.","2594":"Mr. Davis is bombarding Mr. Hilliard with commercials that depict him as an embarrassment. One contrasts images of ground zero with a bill Mr. Hilliard offered to lift sanctions against countries that sponsor terrorism. Mr. Hilliard is shown smiling and clapping opposite pictures of Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi.","2595":"CAIRO, June 3\u2014 Egyptian intelligence warned American officials about a week before Sept. 11 that Osama bin Laden's network was in the advance stages of executing a significant operation against an American target, President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview on Sunday.","2596":"WASHINGTON, June 3\u2014 Early on Sept. 11, Senator Bob Graham and Representative Porter J. Goss were having a quiet breakfast meeting in the Capitol with the chief of Pakistani intelligence, Lt. Gen. Mehmood Ahmed. Mr. Graham and Mr. Goss, the chairmen of the two Congressional intelligence committees, were quizzing their guest about Osama bin Laden and other issues when an aide to Mr. Goss rushed in with a note.","2597":"The Senate Judiciary Committee's proceedings were also closed to the public. Lawmakers on that panel focused on the memorandum by Kenneth Williams, the agent in Phoenix. In that memo, addressed to David Frasca, chief of the F.B.I.'s radical fundamentalist unit, Mr. Williams warned that Osama bin Laden's followers might be training for terror operations at American flight schools. Top F.B.I. officials were unaware of the memorandum until a few days after Sept. 11.","2598":"The man described as a possible relative, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, 37, a Kuwaiti, is now believed to have been a leading figure in Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network who helped plan the attacks, officials said.","2599":"Yes, Egypt has been threatened by Al Qaeda too. But Egypt's way of cracking down has been to either arrest or expel radical Islamic leaders and then leave an ideological vacuum in their wake. The reason a psychopath like Osama bin Laden -- with his Arab, Islamic but backward-looking message -- could gain such currency is because no one in the Arab world, particularly Egypt, has articulated an Arab, Islamic, progressive, democratic alternative to counter him.","26":"American officials said Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged with masterminding the 1998 bombings of American Embassies in East Africa, relied on at least nine of the groups in his recent operations.","260":"The agents interviewed Mr. El-Hage about the bombings and what he knew of Osama bin Laden's role in the attacks. Many of the same questions had been put to him just a year before when he testified in front of a federal grand jury that was hearing evidence against Mr. bin Laden in New York.","2600":"Still, it would be terribly n\u00e4ive not to recognize the semantic tension here. A virtuous religious word has been perversely used by the likes of Osama bin Laden and his followers and now conjures up images of planes crashing into buildings. Some say that because jihad now means such drastically different things to different people, we should avoid such a divisive theme at a celebratory event.","2601":"When he spoke out against the Democrats three weeks ago, Mr. Cheney was trying to contain the fury over the first disclosure of a missed clue, one about a briefing that Mr. Bush received in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking.","2602":"They said agents were now going back through several terrorism cases from the 1990's to see if they could pick up clearer threads about when Mr. Mohammed became part of Mr. Yousef's determined group of Islamic extremists. They said the bureau was also focusing on when Mr. Mohammed teamed up with Osama bin Laden.","2603":"But because the administration continues to listen only to the usual suspects, that window of opportunity is closing fast. And bear this in mind: Whatever he imagines, Osama bin Laden can't destroy Western civilization. Carbon dioxide can.","2604":"He also spoke to her about Al Qaeda and praised Osama bin Laden.","2605":"In Ms. Rowley's memorandum last month, which became known to news organizations within days of its delivery to the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, she said that the 'reasonable suspicion' that Mr. Moussaoui was a terrorist 'quickly ripened into probable cause' in mid-August 'when the French intelligence service confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups and activities connected to Osama bin Laden.'","2606":"The prosecutors said the findings of the psychiatrist, Dr. Raymond Patterson, were in part based on a two-hour interview with Mr. Moussaoui, a Muslim militant who is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network in the attacks. Officials have described Mr. Moussaoui, 34, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, as the 20th hijacker.","2607":"When it comes to striking terror in a White House waging a war on terrorism, Osama bin Laden has nothing on a forthright American woman spilling her guts on daytime television.","2608":"The F.B.I. and C.I.A. have been after Mr. Mohammed for years, even before they knew he was linked to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Investigators believe he played a leading role in helping to finance and plan Mr. Yousef's 1995 plot to blow up airliners over the Pacific. In late 1994 and early 1995, Mr. Mohammed lived in Mr. Yousef's apartment in Manila, where they kept explosive devices and chemicals for use in the airliner operation, court documents say.","2609":"In particular, they said, Congressional investigators are trying to determine whether the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. overlooked a possible Qaeda connection to the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993. The United States has not officially blamed Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden for that operation.","261":"Mr. Salim, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, has been described by prosecutors as a high-level adviser to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Mr. Salim was to have been tried with four other men in the current embassy bombings trial in Manhattan, but his case was separated from the others after he was accused of stabbing and critically injuring the guard, Luis Pepe, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Nov. 1.","2610":"LYON, France\u2014 The 24-year-old Tunisian blamed for the attack on an ancient synagogue in Tunisia this spring, an assault considered the deadliest by operatives linked to Osama bin Laden since Sept. 11, was a surprising convert to Islamic militancy, intelligence officials have concluded.","2611":"The 24-year-old Tunisian who is determined to have carried out the attack on a synagogue in Tunisia this spring, in what is considered the deadliest assault by operatives linked to Osama bin Laden since Sept. 11, was a surprising convert to Islamic militancy, intelligence officials have concluded. 22","2612":"If the United States is going to go after groups like Abu Sayyaf, whose links to Osama bin Laden are tenuous, the list of further targets is potentially long.","2613":"They know that Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar very possibly remain at large, that Qaeda and Taliban soldiers still roam the wild borderlands with Pakistan, that terrorists continue to issue threats. The job seems unfinished, and many say that bothers them.","2614":"'I think it is very sad that people would play upon the victims' families' emotions, or all Americans' emotions,' Mrs. Bush said, referring to the fury surrounding a warning that the president received in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. She added: 'I know my husband, and all Americans know how he has acted in Afghanistan and in the war with terror. I think, really, we need to put this in perspective, and I think it's sad to play upon the emotions of people as if there were something we could have done to stop it, because that's just not the case.'","2615":"But others in the administration, particularly some at the State Department, say an attack on Iraq would be seen as a confrontation with Islam worldwide, damaging Israeli-Palestinian peace prospects, bringing further unrest to the region and undermining support for battling Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.","2616":"Senior government officials said Mr. Padilla had discussed the bomb plot with top Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan, among them Abu Zubaydah, the Osama bin Laden lieutenant who was captured in Pakistan in March and later told United States officials about the plan. But they also said Mr. Padilla had not obtained the materials to make such a device.","2617":"Today's disclosure may well galvanize Americans once again behind the president and the notion that the country remains at war, even as Congress moves ahead with its review of American intelligence failures that allowed Osama bin Laden and members of his Qaeda terrorist network to attack the country on Sept. 11.","2618":"Senior government officials have said Mr. Padilla, who was born in Brooklyn, discussed the bomb plot with Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan, among them Abu Zubaydah, the captured aide to Osama bin Laden who later told American officials about the bomb plan.","262":"The government contends that letters like this prove that Mr. El-Hage and his co-defendants -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- used the cloak of legitimate business to disguise their terrorist plot with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. While Mr. Mohamed and Mr. al-'Owhali have confessed to taking part in the bombings, Mr. El-Hage has maintained that he is simply a businessman who worked for Mr. bin Laden and had nothing to do with the deadly attacks.","2620":"Mr. Teaman, 45, said that he wished he could grab Osama bin Laden 'by the neck.' Instead, he grasped a perfectly honed chunk of grayish Fior de Pesco marble from a quarry in Italy. 'You know, there's a lot of pride here -- doing all this over again.'","2621":"Qatar was Mr. Rumsfeld's final stop in the gulf after visits to Kuwait and Bahrain. The capital, Doha, is home to Al Jazeera, the Arab-language satellite channel that has broadcast messages from Osama bin Laden and has been a frequent target of administration frustration.","2622":"WASHINGTON, June 12\u2014 Attorneys for victims of the 1998 bombings at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania filed a lawsuit against Osama bin Laden and 164 other named defendants today seeking $100 billion in damages.","2623":"It's bad enough that readily available encryption technology and fiber-optic cables often make N.S.A. techniques of interception obsolescent. Worse is that Osama bin Laden started substituting human messengers for cellphone calls four years ago.","2624":"Immediately after his session today with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mr. Rumsfeld was asked about claims, raised by senior Indian leaders, that Osama bin Laden's network had infiltrated into Kashmir.","2625":"The liberals thought they had the Islamic forces in Kuwait on the defensive after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The fact that one of Osama bin Laden's main spokesmen, Suleiman Abu Gheith, turned out to be a Kuwaiti further tarnished them. Kuwait has denied that another bin Laden lieutenant recently singled out by American intelligence is a Kuwaiti.","2626":"The Benevolence International Foundation, an Illinois-based charity active in Bosnia, has become a central focus of the inquiry into the finances of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. A1","2627":"SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2014 Benevolence International Foundation, an Illinois-based charity with broad activities in Bosnia, has emerged as a central focus of the investigation into the finances of Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorist network.","2628":"To NBC's Tom Brokaw, who asked about the pace of the attack on Afghanistan, the square-jawed SecDef retorted, 'To hear your question and the urgency and 'Don't you need quick success?' -- my goodness gracious! go back to World War II.' (Brokaw has done very well going back to World War II.) This was using the phrase as a straight interjection. Rumsfeld also uses it in an adverbial form modifying an affirmative. Asked if he wanted Osama bin Laden dead, he answered, 'Oh, my goodness gracious, yes, after what he's done?' adding for emphasis, 'You bet your life.'","2629":"HOLY WAR, INC.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden, by Peter L. Bergen. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.) The author, a television journalist who interviewed Osama bin Laden for CNN in 1997, maintains that bin Laden's organization is a multinational holding company whose goal is changing America's Middle East policy. Last November our reviewer, Ethan Bronner, called this an 'engaging, well-written account' that successfully sorts through 'the hysteria and half-truths surrounding bin Laden.'","2630":"In November, Mr. Hassoun told The Herald that he had briefly worked for the magazine Call of Islam, which is published by the Islamic Youth Movement and advocates jihad and trains young people in guerrilla warfare, The Associated Press reported. The magazine has featured exclusive interviews with Osama bin Laden.","2631":"WASHINGTON\u2014 AMERICAN officials, riding high on their announcement that they had broken up a plot to detonate a 'dirty bomb' in the United States, said that they were helped by information from Abu Zubaydah, a former lieutenant to Osama bin Laden.","2632":"Mr. Tenet, whose tenure bridges the Clinton and Bush administrations, has a years-long overview of the American response to the terrorist threat and to Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader. In an appearance before the Senate intelligence committee last February, Mr. Tenet said he would welcome a review of the C.I.A.'s record. 'We have been at war with Al Qaeda for over five years,' he said.","2633":"But if Mr. Hanjour had apparently not yet come in contact with terrorist groups, the Tucson he visited in 1990 was already a well-established stop for Islamic militants. During the 1980's, their enemy had been the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan. Alkhifa, a group that recruited fighters and raised money for the jihad in Afghanistan, had one of its three American offices in Tucson. Federal authorities believe that by 1990, after the Soviets retreated from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had absorbed Alkhifa into Al Qaeda, his new terrorist organization.","2634":"It's ironic that the war of ideas that the West hoped would be fought in the Arab Muslim world after Sept. 11 -- a war against the Islamic fascism of Osama bin Laden that would be waged by Arabs offering a democratic, Islamic, progressive alternative -- has not happened, because there is not enough democracy in most places there for that war to even begin. But it is being fought in Iran -- not in response to Sept. 11 but in response to Iran's own bad experiences with secular despotism and religious despotism.","2635":"WASHINGTON, June 18\u2014 Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization began serious planning for a major attack inside the United States soon after it bombed two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998, top intelligence officials told a Congressional committee today.","2636":"Previously Saudi Arabia had said that scores of men rounded up on suspicion of sympathy to or membership in the group spawned by Osama bin Laden, himself a Saudi, had been cleared of any Qaeda connection. Indeed, press reports on Monday said the kingdom had released 160 men detained on their return from Afghanistan because they did not have any link to Al Qaeda.","2637":"The conversations were from Afghanistan, and at least one suspected Al Qaeda operative has been tentatively identified as a participant, officials said. Osama bin Laden was not involved in the intercepted discussions, they added. The existence of the intercepted messages was first reported today on CNN.","2638":"Mr. Darkazanli had ties to other associates of Osama bin Laden, including Wadih el-Hage, a Lebanese-born American who was Mr. bin Laden's personal secretary in Sudan.","2639":"He said that in 1998, an unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information led Osama bin Laden to stop using a satellite phone that the United States had been able to monitor. 'We never again heard from that satellite phone,' Mr. Fleischer said.","2640":"But there are also widespread fears in the expatriate community that the bombings, not all of which follow the same pattern, could be anti-Western attacks carried out either by Al Qaeda cells loyal to Osama bin Laden, who is Saudi-born, or by his sympathizers.","2641":"He claims the Pentagon was not hit by a plane, but by a guided missile fired on orders of far right-wingers inside the United States government. Further, he says, the planes that struck the World Trade Center were not flown by associates of Osama bin Laden, but were programmed by the same government people to fly into the twin towers.","2642":"In their theology classes, the students are taught to defend Islam against the infidels, Jews and Christians, and to strive to convert the infidels to their way of thinking. But the students are also heavily influenced by a cheap and strident anti-American mass-circulation magazine, Sabili, which characterizes Osama bin Laden as a hero.","2643":"At one point, Abu Sayyaf received money from a relative of Osama bin Laden, but beyond that its links to Al Qaeda were tenuous.","2644":"The principal difference between the narcotics trade and legitimate commerce, of course, is that the drug business must operate in the shadow of the law. This throws the entire organizational chart out of whack. Transportation becomes paramount, consolidation and vertical integration -- those cherished buzzwords of merger-hungry multinationals -- impossible. As a result, the narcotics industry has adapted what might be called the Osama bin Laden approach to management: base your operation in remote safe havens, the more war-torn and chaotic the better; stay small and shifty; use specialized subcontractors or freelancers on a need-to-know basis; vary your routes and routines whenever possible; and most important, always insulate yourself with plenty of expendable intermediaries in case someone gets caught and talks.","2645":"A spokesman for Al Qaeda claimed in an audio recording broadcast late yesterday from Qatar that the organization carried out the bloody April attack on a synagogue in Tunis and that the world would hear from Osama bin Laden soon.","2646":"He was in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan when the United States bombed it heavily in hopes of killing Osama bin Laden, officials said. His first wife, also Moroccan, died in the bombing, the officials said.","2647":"Though Mr. Bush's speech tilted heavily toward the view of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who has been arguing since September that Mr. Arafat is no different from Osama bin Laden, some Arab officials and Palestinians focused on the positive elements.","2648":"Some analysts said the government might not have wanted to sign a major deal welcoming in foreign oil companies at a time of open public hostility toward the United States, nor at a time of criticism by Osama bin Laden and his followers over the presence of foreign troops in the holy land of Islam.","2649":"Ground zero is now one of the most popular tourism attractions in the city. It is a place where tour guides charge $15 a head to point out the spot where the firefighters raised the flag. The proud can buy twin tower T-shirts, the angry can buy toilet paper bearing the face of Osama bin Laden and the curious can climb up the fence to take the perfect picture of what is now just a big hole. The hustle of commerce hawking to the crush of sightseers has prompted some to call it 9/11 World.","265":"It was recently introduced at the trial of four men accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Written in Arabic, it covers topics that include advice for Islamic warriors on how to lie low in Western cultures (shave beard, don't be chatty) and explicit guidelines on committing assassinations, using everything from car bombs to clubs to a lethal stew of spoiled meat, green beans and corn.","2650":"And now, faced with the evil of Osama bin Laden, they can no longer imagine there's 'nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too.'","2651":"More than 300 suspected members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban have been picked up in the area in recent months, officials said. Sen. Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in Washington this week that Osama bin Laden was probably in hiding somewhere Pakistan's tribal areas.","2652":"A search of their residence by the Rotterdam police produced some 60 passports, as well as videos of Osama bin Laden and information on land mines.","2653":"AL QAEDA -- Al Jazeera, the Arab-language satellite channel, broadcast an audiotape of a spokesman for Al Qaeda saying that Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were alive. The spokesman also said Al Qaeda was behind the fuel-tanker explosion at a Tunisian synagogue that killed 17 people. Al Jazeera said the recording came from a Kuwaiti journalist who downloaded it from two Internet sites.","2654":"You'll also find a United Nations of workers -- from 37 different countries, according to Joseph Vallone, the plant manager. There is also a makeshift memorial to Sept. 11 on a bulletin board in Annin's lunchroom. It includes the New York Post cover with the picture of Osama bin Laden and the headline, 'Wanted: Dead or Alive,' as well as a photograph of the Sopranos with the caption, 'Just tell us where bin Laden is and fuhgedaboudit.'","2655":"He also criticized the course of the war on terrorism. 'They haven't gotten Osama bin Laden or the Al Qaeda operation,' Mr. Gore said. 'They have refused to allow enough troops from the international community to be put into Afghanistan to keep it from sliding back under control of the warlords.'","2656":"Moderate Arabs still blame the United States for the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism as a political force in the 1970's, when they say American agents cultivated religious student movements on Arab campuses as counterweights to leftist groups. Similarly, Osama bin Laden and other senior Qaeda leaders honed their radical views and picked up weapons training while fighting on the American side in Afghanistan in the 80's.","2658":"In most other ways, though, 'Only in Israel' defies ready parallels. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States, while ultimately inspiring much ridicule of Osama bin Laden, created a climate in which political humor seemed inappropriate, if not unpatriotic. Jay Leno and David Letterman stopped hurling their nightly barbs at President Bush, while Bill Maher was assailed for having said on 'Politically Incorrect' that the hijackers were not cowards because they had willingly killed themselves. Even now, nearly 10 months after the World Trade Center attacks, a comedy routine mocking people's fears of tall buildings or airplanes would be anathema.","2659":"The same V.O.A. news department ignored our State Department's protest and provided a world broadcast platform to Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader harboring Osama bin Laden. Listeners the world over were informed by Omar on our network that 'America has created the evil that is attacking it' and should stop 'imposing its empire' on Islam.","266":"The prosecution rested its case in the federal trial of four men accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the American embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A 180-page manual introduced at trial constitutes a primer for terrorists, part philosophical treatise, part training guide, part Spy vs. Spy from a back issue of Mad magazine. B1","2660":"Ten days ago, Suleiman Abu Gheith, a high-ranking operative of the Qaeda terrorist organization, popped up on Al Jazeera, the cable news channel in the Persian Gulf, to reinforce all the fears of Americans about impending terrorist attacks against the United States. In a confident and comfortable tone of voice, Mr. Abu Gheith assured the world that Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawhiri and Mullah Muhammad Omar are alive and well. On behalf of Al Qaeda, he happily claimed responsibility for the Sept. 11 attacks and the attack in April on a Jewish synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia. He added that the war against the United States was in just its beginning phases and that more attacks were to come.","2661":"The raids have been conducted at the behest of the Pentagon, which is convinced that the area, which falls largely outside the control of the central government, holds many fighters from Al Qaeda, and possibly even Osama bin Laden.","2663":"Family members were barraged with questions about whether the gunman might have been a Muslim fundamentalist who sympathized with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network, many of whose top figures are Egyptian.","2664":"Mr. Qadir was the governor of Nangarhar Province and a member of Hezb-i-Islami, a conservative political party from 1992 to 1994, The leader of that party, Yunis Khalis, gave Osama bin Laden refuge in 1994 when the Saudi national fled Sudan.","2665":"Mr. Qadir's long involvement in the cutthroat world of Afghan politics ensured that he had many enemies. He fought against the Taliban, but he belonged to a political party that once gave shelter to Osama bin Laden. As he emerged as the governor of Nangarhar province after the rout of the Taliban, he angered many of his rivals.","2666":"Federal investigators are conducting raids nationwide on jewelry stores owned mostly by Pakistanis, hoping to break up fronts for terrorist groups or their financial backers, officials said. The raids have taken place over the last two weeks in several cities, including New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. About 75 jewelry stores have been raided, a law enforcement official said. Tariq Hussain, 27, a recently discharged United States Army mechanic whose Intrigue Jewelers kiosk in suburban Pittsburgh was searched on June 26, said F.B.I. agents questioned him about connections to the Qaeda terrorist network or its leader, Osama bin Laden.","2667":"Mr. Bush also suggested that in the broader effort to prevent terrorism, he had slightly altered his approach toward the capture of Osama bin Laden, having said soon after the Sept. 11 attacks that it was his goal to take Mr. bin Laden 'dead or alive.'","2668":"One of the first signs of a large infusion of cash coming into the United States for use by the hijackers appears in bank records dating from 2000, when $100,000 was deposited in bank accounts controlled by some of the leading hijackers, including Mr. Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, Mr. Lormel said. The F.B.I. has traced that money back to the United Arab Emirates and believes that it was sent to the hijackers by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hisawi, who is accused of helping to manage Osama bin Laden's finances.","2669":"Mohamed Heidar Zammar, the German citizen now held in Syria, for instance, first came to the attention of American and German authorities in late 1998 during the investigation of Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who is considered a founder of Al Qaeda and suspected of being the financial chief for Osama bin Laden.","267":"The manual, 18 chapters in all, was recently introduced at the trial of four men accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The document was seized in England last May at the home of a suspect still being sought in the terrorism case.","2670":"In this hourlong film, its reporter and producer, Gwynne Roberts, travels to Iraqi Kurdistan searching for links between Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden. He is accompanied by a doctor studying the long-term effects of poison gas on the towns and villages (more than 200 of them) attacked by Mr. Hussein in the late 1980's. The Hussein-Bin Laden connection is the more explosive subject. The claims are chilling if true, but while the evidence is convincing it remains unproved here. The effects of the poison gas, however, are viscerally, undeniably horrifying. On both counts the narrative and the images in 'Saddam's Ultimate Solution' are as gripping as any drama.","2671":"PARIS\u2014 Osama bin Laden is dead. The news first came from sources in Afghanistan and Pakistan almost six months ago: the fugitive died in December and was buried in the mountains of southeast Afghanistan. Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, echoed the information. The remnants of Osama's gang, however, have mostly stayed silent, either to keep Osama's ghost alive or because they have no means of communication.","2672":"Mention that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in attacking America were Saudis to almost any room full of people here, and denials still pour forth. There is no concrete evidence, people will argue, adding that even if Osama bin Laden, a native son, was somehow involved, he was led astray by his rabid Egyptian coterie.","2673":"In the background lurks a terrorist guru, Hilal (Jackie Schroff), modeled after Osama bin Laden. 'Extremists perform symbolic actions with the intention of causing a larger conflict,' said Vikram Chandra, a novelist who wrote the film. So it is with Hilal, who constantly cajoles Altaaf into committing violence that will play Hindu against Muslim.","2674":"Thanks to the shenanigans of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and the rest, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen further in the last three months than it did in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Think about it. The boardroom brethren have walloped the stock market harder than Osama bin Laden did.","2675":"A man suspected by the government of being an agent for Osama bin Laden pleaded guilty this week to illegally entering the United States in June 2001, federal authorities said yesterday.","2676":"WASHINGTON\u2014 In the course of 24 hours last week President Bush gave a major speech calling for business reforms that will 'usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America' and held a press conference that dealt more with Mr. Bush's conduct when he was a Harken Energy board member than with the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives was grilling former and current WorldCom executives about accounting irregularities, and senators were voting unanimously to support tough new corporate-reform legislation.","2677":"The current scandal is the penalty for this inconsistent vigilance. It is now clear that Cardinal Law was not alone among the bishops in his insensitive and often dismissive response to victims' complaints, and in his reluctance and occasional refusal to remove even multiply accused priests like John Geoghan and Paul Shanley from active ministry. Disclosures of similar episcopal behavior in other dioceses made 'the crisis in the Catholic Church' the biggest story involving religion in years -- and that's saying something in the days of Osama bin Laden and Islamic extremism.","268":"ROME, April 5\u2014 Italian officials announced today that they had arrested five North African men suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden, and said they were searching for five others. The German police also said they had arrested a member of an Islamic fundamentalist cell today after raiding eight sites in Hesse and Bavaria.","2680":"Second, the Lindh plea shows the hazard of overpromising the public on what federal prosecutors can deliver. While the Bush administration is exceptionally secretive about much that should be public in this war on terrorism (for example, what happened to all the people held in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11), it has been too vocal in trumpeting the likely outcome of pending legal cases. Public statements by Attorney General John Ashcroft that Mr. Lindh had met with Osama bin Laden are hard to explain when the defendant is allowed to plead to charges that do not relate to terrorism. Winning a legal case is never as straightforward as winning a debating point on a cable television show. The success of our efforts against terrorism will be measured, in time, by how well we and our allies carry out law enforcement efforts. Prudence and probity are essential.","2682":"F.B.I. officials said the bureau believed that the transfers were sent by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hisawi, who has been identified as a financial manager for Osama bin Laden. Mr. Hisawi is widely believed to have fled to Pakistan before Sept. 11, but only after receiving unused cash back from the hijackers.","2683":"The Spanish group has been linked to Osama bin Laden's operations in Europe and Afghanistan, and specifically to the Qaeda cell in Germany that produced three of the hijackers who led the Sept. 11 attacks.","2684":"Without informers in or near the group's leadership, the C.I.A. was unable to provide specific warnings of the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. The subcommittee chairman, Representative Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said the C.I.A. failed to get any informers close enough to Osama bin Laden to learn his plans.","2685":"Zacarias Moussaoui tried to plead guilty to conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks, and he admitted in court that he was a member of the Qaeda network, had joined in plans for terrorist acts and was loyal to Osama bin Laden. But a federal judge refused to accept the surprise plea and urged Mr. Moussaoui, who is representing himself, to take a week to reconsider. A1","2686":"ALEXANDRIA, Va., July 18\u2014 Zacarias Moussaoui tried today to plead guilty to conspiring in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and acknowledged in court that he was a member of the Qaeda network, had joined in plans for terrorist acts and was loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2687":"Government officials say they have no direct evidence that Mr. Moussaoui had a role in the hijackings. From the beginning the evidence has been circumstantial. Now, some government officials, in interviews, are saying that prosecutors overreached when they charged that Mr. Moussaoui was a direct participant with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in the conspiracy to kill thousands of people on Sept. 11.","2688":"After Sept. 11, however, Manhattan acquired a terrible new symbolism, and economic uncertainty has taken a toll on hedonism, at least of the expense-account kind. Osama bin Laden has outpaced Monica Lewinsky by 17 to 1 in the pages of The New York Times over the last year. Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays Carrie Bradshaw, the newspaper writer whose column tracks her adventures in dating, is pregnant in real life. Kim Cattrall, who plays the public relations vamp, Samantha, published a sex manual with her husband this year -- in which she confessed that she didn't enjoy her 20 years of sex before meeting him. And earlier this month, Candace Bushnell, the sleek blonde writer whose libidinous columns in The New York Observer and subsequent book spawned 'Sex and the City,' got married, at 43 (to a man 10 years younger than she, but still, married).","2689":"In the House of Commons, Mr. Blair said that Britain has gathered extensive evidence that 'Saddam Hussein is still trying to develop weapons of mass destruction' and that Britain will publish the evidence 'at the appropriate time.' Last fall, the British government published the first detailed report that Osama bin Laden was directly linked to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, thus laying down an important predicate for the war in Afghanistan.","269":"The verdict, coming after less than 11 hours of deliberation over two days, culminated a trial that had been expected to focus on federal charges that Mr. Ressam had plotted to set off bombs at the behest of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi who American authorities say has orchestrated a series of international terrorist acts.","2690":"The Abu Sayyaf group has operated in the Philippines since the early 1990's. Initially it demanded an Islamic state in the south, but degenerated into what Philippine military commanders describe as bandits. At one point, Abu Sayyaf received money from a relative of Osama bin Laden, but beyond that, any possible links to Al Qaeda are uncertain.","2691":"'There's a handful of C.E.O.'s that have done more to hurt our economy than Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda combined, and I have absolutely no sympathy for any of them,' Mr. D'Alessandro said. 'All the C.E.O.'s I talk to share the same viewpoint.'","2692":"The turnaround by Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen who has admitted that he is a member of the Qaeda terrorist network and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, came when he balked at a federal judge's ruling that a guilty plea would require him to confess to detailed involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy.","2694":"Mr. Moussaoui acknowledged in federal court that he was a member of Al Qaeda, the terrorist network set up by Osama bin Laden, and suggested he was sent to the United States to participate in a terrorist conspiracy. But Mr. Moussaoui said at a hearing on Thursday that while he might have associated with some of the hijackers, 'it doesn't mean that I'm on the plane' with them.","2696":"WASHINGTON, July 30\u2014 Some of Osama bin Laden's personal bodyguards have been apprehended and are now being held at the American military base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, government officials said today.","2697":"'I think there were serious errors,' Mr. Kerry said in an interview, referring to the American ground campaign in Afghanistan that he contends probably allowed Osama bin Laden to slip into Pakistan. He made the point again on Monday as he joined other potential presidential candidates in speaking to centrist Democrats in New York.","2698":"Mr. Hussein has been condemned as a Muslim apostate by Islamic militant leaders, including Osama bin Laden, but Kurdish officials say religious politics mean little to the Iraqi ruler when he sees an opportunity to strike his enemies.","2699":"In my opinion, no. I would say that the majority of people who commit acts of terrorism are doing it because of a twisted way of thinking that it's the only tool they have. I have heard people call Osama bin Laden a megalomaniac. Not to defend the guy, but I don't think his personal desires play into it. He thinks he's doing something for a cause. I don't think that he's trying to make a name for himself.","270":"The document, 'Military Studies in the Jihad Against the Tyrants,' surfaced recently at the trial of four men accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden to destroy the embassies. The how-to manual is about 180 pages long and is divided into 18 'lessons' covering a wide range of topics, from forgery and surveillance to advice on how to beat hostages to detailed instructions for various assassination techniques.","2700":"Mr. Moussaoui has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden. But he has insisted that he was not involved in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. On the day of the attacks, Mr. Moussaoui was in a Minnesota prison cell; he was arrested in August after raising suspicions among instructors at a flight school he was attending near Minneapolis .","2701":"He was arrested two weeks later. At the time of his arrest, the police raided his apartment in southeast London and found a laptop computer containing articles about Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","2703":"Administration officials in Washington said that the intelligence report from the foreign government, which they declined to identify, was the second report that the administration had received in recent months about possible plans to attack major monuments in the United States. The first came from Abu Zubaydah, a senior aide to Osama bin Laden, who last spring told American officials of plans to strike the bridge in the 'Godzilla' movie.","2704":"Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen, is charged with conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks. Although he has acknowledged that he is a member of the Qaeda terrorist network and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. He was in jail in Minnesota on the day of the attacks, under arrest for visa violations after arousing the suspicion of instructors at a flight school near Minneapolis.","2705":"The president spoke to the nation's chief executives in the same terms he has reserved for Osama bin Laden: 'If you break the law, we will hunt you down, we will arrest you, and we will prosecute you.' But Mr. Bush said that the good news for the economy is that the 'vast majority of C.E.O.'s are good, honorable people' who 'care deeply about their shareholders and their employees.'","2706":"WASHINGTON, Aug. 14\u2014 More than 300 family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks are preparing to file suit against various 'interests' associated with the government of Saudi Arabia, alleging that they helped finance Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, a Washington lawyer representing the families said today.","2707":"In a rare public appearance last month, Mr. Watson said at a law enforcement conference that he believed Osama bin Laden was dead. 'I personally think he is probably not with us anymore, but I have no evidence to support that,' he said.","2708":"And what does the administration propose as a solution? Last week John Ashcroft went on TV to announce what he calls the 'first ever White House conference on missing and exploited children.' It takes an exploiter to know one. F.B.I. figures show a decline in the kidnapping of children -- except on cable TV. But if you can't crack the anthrax case, why not create some distracting hysteria by glomming onto a local law enforcement issue that is the biggest showbiz phenomenon since shark attacks? The administration loves the bait-and-switch. It hyped the cases of 'the American Taliban,' John Walker Lindh, and the 'dirty bomber,' Jose Padilla, to cover for its failure to snare the actual Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and the actual bomber, Osama bin Laden, much as it has hyped the perp walks of second-rung executives from WorldCom to make us forget about Halliburton, Harken and Ken Lay.","2709":"In new allegations, prosecutors say agents searching Mr. Marri's apartment found an almanac in which business cards were used to bookmark pages describing major dams, reservoirs, and car and railroad tunnels. The agents say they also found a file on Mr. Marri's computer that showed a picture of Osama bin Laden and played a recorded prayer that praises Mr. bin Laden and makes implicit threats against Americans.","271":"Pakistan, which Washington considers an ally, has serious economic and political problems and faces a rising tide of more than a million Afghan refugees. But Washington has also led the drive to isolate the Taliban for harboring Osama bin Laden, who is wanted for masterminding the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.","2710":"The archive includes instruction tapes on bomb-making and on how to shoot surface-to-air weapons, as well as the first meeting of Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders with foreign journalists in May 1998, and other tapes -- often violent -- contributed by affiliated groups in Bosnia, Chechnya, Somalia, Sudan and elsewhere.","2711":"To be fair, Florida State is not the only entity to use words or images from the ghastly national tragedy. Outside the ballpark in Pittsburgh, when baseball resumed last September, a vendor was selling T-shirts that bawdily mocked Osama bin Laden. Athletes have worn NYPD and FDNY caps in games. Bruce Springsteen issued songs on the theme, and Neil Young wrote one called 'Let's Roll.'","2712":"CNN says it paid about $30,000 for the videotapes of Osama bin Laden and operatives of Al Qaeda that it has been showing. CNN executives and Nic Robertson, the correspondent who obtained the tapes, had previously indicated that the network did not pay for them. The network blamed the erroneous contention on miscommunication and its attempts to protect its reporters overseas. [A8.]","2713":"CNN said yesterday that it paid about $30,000 to people in Afghanistan for the videotapes of Osama bin Laden and operatives of Al Qaeda it has been showing this week.","2715":"Raw intelligence reports cannot be published without compromising confidential sources and methods. But the basic intelligence evidence that underlies critical national decisions can and must be made public. Past administrations have done that repeatedly, for example, by displaying spy-plane photos of Russian missiles in Cuba in 1962 or releasing cockpit-to-tower conversations recorded during Moscow's downing of a Korean passenger jet in 1983. Before last fall's airstrikes in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain presented a compendium of intelligence findings linking Osama bin Laden and the Taliban to the Sept. 11 attacks. If Mr. Bush means to propose launching a preventive war against Iraq, he must do no less.","2716":"But Mr. Gymnastiar is not afraid to say he has yet to see enough proof that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. 'There has to be to be a visible trial,' he said.","2717":"Seated cross-legged on concrete cell floors, the men, most of them Pakistanis, profess a blithe ignorance of the basics of warfare, much less terrorism. The Kalashnikov rifle, the ubiquitous weapon of Islamic militancy? Not one of the prisoners admits to ever having handled one. Osama bin Laden? Not a man among them acknowledges any thoughts about him, good or bad. Sept. 11? Something they know little about, other than that many people died.","2718":"The Seattle Times has reported that investigators believe that Mr. Ujaama and two members of the London mosque of Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri, a radical clergyman who is suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden, visited a farm in Bly, Ore., to try to set up a Qaeda training camp in 1999.","2719":"The main thing is, I got a 20-year-old son, and he's doing great now, but he's been kind of a hard dog to keep under the porch at times, kind of like I was at 20. Also, I get naturally suspicious when politicians start agreeing with each other as much as they were following Sept. 11. It just occurred to me that we were going to get this kid because we couldn't come up with a body that we could say was Osama bin Laden.","272":"In that case, he is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in a global conspiracy to kill Americans abroad that included the Aug. 7, 1998, attacks on the American Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 224 people and wounded thousands more.","2720":"The new prospect of America becoming less American -- less open and accepting, in particular -- is tremendously saddening. It appears now that younger Arabs will not have the same opportunity I had. All the security checks and resurgent stereotyping will decrease the number of Arabs visiting the United States and studying in its colleges. For the time being, then, Osama bin Laden has a victory: a worsening of relations, perhaps true enmity between two cultures.","2721":"In trying to understand his dangerous new assignment, which will include a military operation to kill Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden as they meet in Iraq to plot evil, the fictional Newman reaches out to the real-life North.","2722":"ASADABAD, Afghanistan, Aug. 23\u2014 After months of frustration, American commanders appear to have concluded that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive and moving between mountain hideouts somewhere on a 250-mile stretch of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.","2723":"Wrong, says Daniel Pipes in this anthology of random pieces going back to 1990. That Tuesday from hell was not the beginning, let alone the end of history. Nor should the hijackers, their shadowy handlers and Osama bin Laden be taken for the authentic voice of Islam, the religion and civilization, with 1.3 billion adherents and nearly 1,400 years of history. On the contrary, says Mr. Pipes. What hit us on Sept. 11 was Islamism, the ideology, a product of relatively recent civilizational discontents in a swath of the world where a glorious past has somehow led to a futureless present.","2724":"American commanders, after months of frustration, appear to have concluded that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive and moving between mountain hideouts somewhere on a 250-mile stretch of the 1,400-mile border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. A1","2726":"Why? Because it exhibits such profound lack of understanding of what America is about, and it exhibits such a chilling mimicry of what the most repressive Arab Muslim states are about. Ask yourself this question: What would Osama bin Laden do if he found out that the University of Riyadh had asked incoming freshmen to read the New and Old Testaments?","2727":"At the same time many of the more serious 9/11 books try to subject the chaos and fear of that seismic day to the ordering, sense-making mechanics of narrative. In compressing a mass of incidents, images and evidence -- material already familiar to us from the media coverage the events received (in sharp contrast to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which did not immediately interrupt regular programming on many radio stations) -- many books create story lines that play to the public's perceived need for closure. These books consciously or unconsciously accentuate the positive, following a therapeutic arc that underscores the nation's movement from shock and horror, through grief and mourning, toward patriotic solidarity and resolve, never mind that Osama bin Laden has yet to be found, Al Qaeda remains a threat, and the war on terrorism rumbles on with no end in sight.","2728":"It was May 1998, long before Afghanistan became the Times Square of journalism after last year's war, and Mr. Miller had an appointment with Osama bin Laden. 'We are not women,' Ali said with indignation. 'We will not wear veils. We will walk, as men.' A few minutes later, Mr. Miller, incongruously wearing Afghan garments, Armani glasses and white socks, crossed over Pakistan's northern border and began walking toward the high peaks of eastern Afghanistan.","2729":"With this global context solidly established, Mr. Bernstein begins cross cutting in time and place, alternating minibiographies of emergent Al Qaeda leaders like Osama bin Laden (a close follower of Azzam), with portraits of their victims (police, firefighters, Trade Center workers), tracking them as they swept toward a rendezvous with disaster. The climactic chapter returns to the scene of the crime, describing the bloody denouement with a combination of compassion and precision.","2730":"If Osama bin Laden is alive, then President Bush is playing into his hands by planning to invade Iraq. The Qaeda leader has wasted his life trying, unsuccessfully, to unite the Muslim world against the United States. Now Mr. Bush is planning to give him his wish -- not only hatred from the Muslim world, but the enmity of the entire civilized world. And for what purpose? To prove that he can do it?","2731":"The draft United Nations report cites unidentified experts and government sources in asserting financial operatives are still managing at least $30 million on behalf of Osama bin Laden and his organization.","2732":"Of course we still remember the missing, and mourn them, and not even a maudlin, self-aggrandizing media orgy a year later could so deaden our senses that we would forget. But a certain national numbness, or perhaps amnesia, is settling in. If we remember the dead of Sept. 11 vividly, we are gradually losing sight of those who carried out their slaughter. Wasn't our mission to track down Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, dead or alive, before they struck again? We are now gearing up to fight another war that has been grandfathered into the war on terrorism. While it too targets an unambiguous evildoer, it is a different mission that is already obscuring the first and may yet defeat it.","2733":"A front-page article on Wednesday about the search for Osama bin Laden misstated the location of the Shah-i-Kot Valley, the site of the biggest American ground battle in the war to oust the Taliban. It is 100 miles south of Kabul, not southwest.","2734":"He was identified as belonging to a group of about 20 Muslims on board the plane that was heading for a conference in Birmingham, England, arranged by a Muslim sect known as Salafists. The sect describes itself as a purist strand of the Islamic faith. Its spokesman in Birmingham, Abu Khadeejah, said the conference organizers did not know Mr. Chatty. He also said the Salafists reject terrorism and had condemned both Osama bin Laden and the attacks last Sept. 11.","2735":"Osama bin Laden presented himself as having acted on behalf of Arab honor and Islamic doctrine. The attacks set off both official and vigilante responses in America, ranging from the detention of several thousand Arab suspects to the vandalism of mosques and the beating of Arabs and South Asians. Islam has been assailed as an intrinsically violent faith. The University of North Carolina was criticized by politicians for assigning incoming students to read a book about the Koran.","2736":"The Seattle Times has reported that investigators believe that Mr. Kassir and a member of the London mosque of Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri, a radical cleric who is believed to have contact with Osama bin Laden, tried to set up the camp in Oregon, along with James Ujaama. Mr. Ujaama has been held since July 22 as a material witness for a grand jury in Virginia that is investigating Sheik Masri; on Wednesday, Mr. Ujaama was indicted.","2738":"No one was seriously injured in the incident outside the Tandoori Cottage Restaurant in Selden, N.Y., late Saturday, but investigators quoted Mehmooda Malik, 37, and her son, Gibbran, as saying the attackers and other youths confronted them with anti-Muslim profanities and shouts of 'Are you terrorists?' 'You blew up the twin towers!' and 'Are you connected to Osama bin Laden?'","2739":"Commanders in the American military's most elite Special Operations unit are arguing that their troops should be freed from a fruitless hunt in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, military and intelligence officials say. Some senior officers in the Joint Special Operations Command have concluded that Mr. bin Laden is dead, though they lack hard evidence, officials said. Other military and intelligence officials have sharply disagreed with their assessment. A1","274":"CNN wrote that after federal prosecutors played the jury a videotape in February of a CNN interview with Osama bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the embassy attacks, 'CNN learned of potential threats to the safety of its correspondents in the Middle East and was forced to cancel the visit of a senior CNN news executive for safety reasons.'","2740":"PARIS, Sept. 2\u2014 With growing evidence of militant Islamic activities in the Netherlands, Dutch prosecutors charged eight men today with helping to recruit, house and finance fighters for the Qaeda network headed by Osama bin Laden.","2741":"A week after he occupied newspaper headlines and a segment on the 'Today' show to ventilate his dispute with another comedian, JACKIE MASON is in forward-looking mode, anticipating his next one-man Broadway show, 'Prune Danish,' and its barbs at the expense of both Osama bin Laden and President Bush.","2742":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 2\u2014 Commanders in the American military's most elite Special Operations unit are contending that their troops should be freed from the fruitless hunt in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, military and intelligence officials say.","2743":"It seems ridiculous to me for President Bush to advocate war against Iraq when the United States military hasn't even been able to capture or kill Osama bin Laden ('Administration Seeking to Build Support in Congress on Iraq Issue,' front page, Aug. 30).","2744":"Instead, the program uses Mr. Bush's words as a springboard to consider what evil might be. A professor of theology says that you can call Osama bin Laden 'the personification of evil,' but 'even if you say that, evil is bigger.'","2745":"But it was his connection with Raed Hijazi, who was convicted in Jordan of plotting to blow up tourist sites on the eve of the millennium, that focused interest. Mr. Hijazi was reported to have accused Mr. Marabh of being an agent of Osama bin Laden.","2746":"The war against Osama bin Laden is not finished, he said. 'My concern,' he said, 'is that we have not even begun to achieve in Afghanistan anything that could be called nation-building.'","2747":"A reputed top aide to Osama bin Laden who has pleaded guilty to stabbing a jail guard in New York testified yesterday that he wanted to break out and go to the United Nations to proclaim his innocence.","2748":"Twelve short months ago, President Bush proclaimed that he wanted Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.' Yet now -- after nearly a year of dogged searching -- Mr. Bush's Special Operations commanders in Afghanistan find the search for the terrorist leader fruitless and want to give up (front page, Sept. 3).","2749":"In an unrelated case, Dutch prosecutors charged eight foreigners with helping to recruit and finance fighters for the Qaeda network headed by Osama bin Laden. Dutch security police said the group had sought combatants for the international holy war.","275":"The embassy bombings trial, in which four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been charged with joining Osama bin Laden in an international terrorist conspiracy that led to attacks killing more than 200 people, is much like the World Trade Center case, Mr. Precht said. Both, he said, highlight 'a clash of systems.'","2751":"The suit, brought by the firm Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, names as defendants Iraq, the Iraqi intelligence agency, Saddam Hussein and his sons, Al Qaeda Islamic Army, Osama bin Laden, the estates of the hijackers, the Taliban and organizations that provided money for the attacks.","2752":"'The Axis of Evil is North Korea, Iraq and Iran,' he wrote this time, painting over the original statements. 'Osama bin Laden is the top terrorist. George W. Bush is a good leader. And Iceland is not a banana republic.'","2753":"Officials denied a resident Turkish couple's request to name their newborn Osama bin Laden. German regulations require that children's names not be offensive -- the name Hitler is banned -- and that the names of foreign families' children be acceptable in their countries of origin. Registration officials in Cologne, where the couple lives, said they had rejected the name because it would not be allowed in Turkey and because of its association with the Sept. 11 attacks. The matter has been sent to a judge, who will have final say.","2754":"An article yesterday about a survivors' lawsuit filed in Manhattan charging the Iraqi government with complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks gave a misspelled surname in some copies for an Iraqi columnist who reported in July 2001 that Osama bin Laden was making plans to 'demolish the Pentagon after he destroys the White House.' The columnist is Naeem Abd Muhalhal, not Mulhalhal.","2756":"A reputed senior aide to Osama bin Laden admitted in federal court that he devised a plan to take hostages in an effort to win freedom for himself and four other New York inmates. A7","2757":"A reputed senior aide to Osama bin Laden who has been jailed in New York since 1998 admitted in federal court yesterday that he planned two years ago to take hostages in a bid to win freedom for himself and other terrorism suspects at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.","2758":"The man, 25, had a picture of Osama bin Laden in the apartment, near Heidelberg, along with Islamic literature and a book about building bombs, said Thomas Sch\u00e4uble, the chief prosecutor for the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The arrested woman, a 23-year-old who held joint German and American citizenship, worked at a supermarket for American military personnel and dependents at the military base in Heidelberg, the prosecutor said.","2759":"What some members of Congress have called the greatest failure in American intelligence since Pearl Harbor was also a failure to recognize an open and determined enemy. Osama bin Laden announced publicly that he was going to smite the empire. He assured Americans that he had motive, means and opportunity.","276":"His client, Wadih El-Hage, is one of four men accused of participating in a terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the killings of 18 American soldiers in Somalia in the fall of 1993.","2760":"During the cold war, eavesdropping on unencrypted Russian communications was a relatively simple task since the Soviet military was easy to locate and they communicated endlessly over known communications channels. But in the post-9/11 world, the N.S.A. is faced with the flip side of the coin. Members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups operate in small cells hidden throughout the world, communicate infrequently and often with untraceable phone cards over random pay phones. E-mail messages are sent using anonymous computers, servers and screen names in libraries, copy shops or other public places. It is little surprise, therefore, that the last time the N.S.A. was able to eavesdrop on Osama bin Laden was in 1998, three years before the attacks.","2761":"But many Afghans say Al Qaeda plotted to kill Mr. Massoud to deprive Afghanistan of its most renowned military commander ahead of the American onslaught that ensued after Sept. 11. According to this theory, Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, may have reasoned that without Mr. Massoud the Northern Alliance forces he led would disintegrate, denying the United States the ready ally it found in the alliance.","2763":"Rick Rescorla and Dan Hill, the long-ago soldiers and longtime comrades at the center of James B. Stewart's new book, thought like Norsemen. In 1998, when Osama bin Laden was blamed for the bombing of two American embassies in Africa, Hill hatched a plan to assassinate him. Although Hill and the Army had parted unhappily more than 20 years earlier, he was still a patriot. (And there was a reported $15 million bounty to consider.) Rescorla warned him that he might kill bin Laden but he'd probably be killed himself. 'I'm not risking that much,' Hill replied. 'Anyway, it's better than being an old man.' Hill's assassination plan didn't work out. A few years later, in the spring of 2001, he and Rescorla were reminiscing about the Vietnam War, from which Rescorla in particular had emerged a hero. By now Rescorla was director of security for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Manhattan, and was being treated for prostate cancer. 'Men like us shouldn't go out like this. We're supposed to die in some desperate battle performing great deeds.'","2765":"The police found 287 pounds of chemicals, five pipe bombs, and a picture of Osama bin Laden in the apartment, and immediately arrested the couple, on suspicion of plotting an attack on the American military at Heidelberg.","2767":"Now the good news. To begin with, Friedman is more often right than not. He was profoundly right in saying that Sept. 11 was an appalling crime that had no conceivable justification, or even any real origin in oppression and injustice. That might not sound like such an amazing insight, but it quite eluded the 'America had it coming' left in Europe and on some campuses in the United States. As Friedman saw, Osama bin Laden was not the brave if misguided proponent of a worthy cause, and he didn't care twopence for the Palestinians. He was -- let's hope the past tense is correct -- a bloodthirsty religious maniac, and his followers were deluded fanatics for whom murder was some obscure compensation for failure.","2768":"Capturing or killing Osama bin Laden remains a benchmark of sorts for success in Afghanistan. Three-quarters of the poll's respondents said they think he is still alive; 61 percent said the United States will not have won the war in Afghanistan unless he is captured or killed.","2769":"Such preparation and attention to detail is the heart of Al Qaeda's tradecraft. Members of the organization began photographing the United States Embassy in Nairobi in 1993, five years before it was bombed, says Peter L. Bergen, author of 'Holy War Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden' (Free Press, 2001). Planning for the Sept. 11 attacks began at least two years before the hijackings.","277":"Three American officials, including two from the State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, are in Afghanistan to look into the crisis brought on by war, drought and extreme poverty, United Nations officials said. Though the United States and the United Nations have imposed sanctions on Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden, suspected of terrorist activities, the United States is one of the country's biggest aid donors. Celia Dugger (NYT)","2770":"On the first anniversary of Sept. 11, many of the Islamic operatives who enlisted in the holy war on America are dead or in jail, but signs are that Al Qaeda is very much alive and hankering for another hit. Thus the unease of millions of ordinary Americans, and the undoubted chagrin of President Bush, who hasn't had much to say about Osama bin Laden since issuing his swaggering 'Wanted: Dead or Alive' declaration last year. Whatever the elusive bin Laden's current status, security officials are proceeding on the assumption that the question is not if, but when, his determined minions will strike again.","2771":"The final two shorts are by Idrissa Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso and Shohei Imamura of Japan. Mr. Ouedraogo has five boys imagining they could win a $25 million reward for capturing Osama bin Laden. Mr. Imamura follows a World War II veteran who thinks he is a snake after witnessing the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The veteran director ends his short with the words: 'There is no holy war.'","2772":"On Nov. 29, 1999, a 31-year-old architecture student in Germany named Mohamed Atta, unknown to the world but already determined to strike an unforgettable blow against those he believed to be his enemies, boarded Turkish Airlines Flight 1662 from Istanbul to Karachi, Pakistan. Mr. Atta took at least a couple of days to reach his final destination: a training camp in Afghanistan run by Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's sprawling international terrorist organization.","2773":"A reputed senior aide to Osama bin Laden who pleaded guilty to stabbing a jail guard testified yesterday that he lied to his lawyer when he told him he had carried out the attack, in November 2000, in an attempt to escape from a jail in Lower Manhattan.","2774":"Both broadcasts involved only snippets of the exclusive material, but they could provide the most direct linkage yet made public between the attacks and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. The interviews come in the wake of similar tapes broadcast by Al Jazeera. The source of the material could not be independently confirmed.","2777":"'For those of us who survived, we are not going to live each day in fear or have him destroy our spirit or finish the ugly job he started,' Mr. Dunne said, referring to Osama bin Laden. 'We are going to do just the opposite: honor the people lost and work as hard as we can to rebuild what they tried to destroy.'","2778":"Q. One of the things I remember, the question that stood out to me this year was by Senator Pat Roberts in February at an open hearing with Tenet -- I don't know if you remember the question. He said, you know, 'When I go back to Dodge City, Kan., and talk to the kaffeeklatsch, people are saying, asking me if John Walker Lindh could get in to see Osama bin Laden, why couldn't the C.I.A.?'","2779":"American investigators trying to reconstruct the Sept. 11 hijacking plot have found evidence of a 1999 meeting between the leader of the plot, Mohamed Atta, and Osama bin Laden. A1","278":"In court yesterday, lawyers for one of the defendants, Wadih El-Hage, continued their effort to disprove the government's allegations that their client was a member of a terrorist conspiracy that was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.","2780":"'Management books talk about learning organizations,' said one American intelligence official. Osama bin Laden, the official said, 'built something that is a learning organization. It is changing and adapting to the loss of its infrastructure.'","2781":"The organization has links to Al Qaeda, having received money from Osama bin Laden and having sent many of its members -- including Mr. Faruq -- to Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, Western and Asian intelligence officials said. They stress, however, that Jemaah Islamiyah has its own regional agenda and acts on its own. Officials said today that there was no evidence that Mr. bin Laden, if he is still alive, or any of his lieutenants had been behind the plot that led to the embassy closings.","2782":"But Osama bin Laden remains unaccounted for, a dangerous mind bent against the West, able to transport that danger, as if by Internet or other invisible circuits, home to Americans. So the war in Afghanistan on the slopes of Tora Bora or Khost is only part of it. The rest is here.","2783":"A man reputed to have been a senior aide to Osama bin Laden testified yesterday that he never wanted to stab a guard in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in November 2000, but that he did so anyway because he felt it would be the only way to seize his keys.","2784":"In Dallas, Ken Goldberg, who runs the DFW Gun Range, says he has noticed a softening of the pain over time: there has been a decided drop in his customers' once-raging demand for Osama bin Laden paper targets to shred with gunfire.","2785":"At first, Mr. Bush was ferocious, spitting cowboy threats about getting Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar 'dead or alive.'","2786":"With so much language from the Old West, it's not surprising that some people worried Mr. Bush would shoot first and ask questions later. Mr. Pelley points out that some in the Pentagon were concerned that the president might immediately launch missiles toward Osama bin Laden, a tactic that had failed before. Mr. Bush seems amused and says offhandedly, 'There's a lot of Nervous Nellies at the Pentagon anyway, a lot of people like to chatter.'","2787":"And no president preparing to make the case for war in Iraq -- a war about which the Congress and nation still have questions -- could afford to be surprised by another devastating blow from Osama bin Laden, the elusive terrorist leader who it is believed to have ordered the strikes against the United States a year ago.","2788":"THE CASE: Mr. Bush names Osama bin Laden as the chief suspect and declares he's wanted dead or alive. The President also orders the freeze of all domestic assets of 278 groups with ties to terror organizations.","2789":"Now Mr. Bush seems determined to transform Sept. 11 into a milestone on the road to war with Iraq, and to use last year's attack by Osama bin Laden and the continued threat from Al Qaeda to justify this year's pursuit of Saddam Hussein. Clearly, the two are not yet linked in the minds of many Americans and most of America's allies. Before today's threat, polls showed Americans largely out of sync with the president, more worried about a jobless recovery than terrorism. But over the past year, the linkage in the president's mind between Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Hussein has grown tighter -- and given birth to a new policy of pre-emption that encapsulates Mr. Bush's view that the United States must strike before it is struck again.","279":"On one level, the defense lawyers are concerned that evidence against one man could taint the other. But on a much more fundamental level, they fear that their clients will be seen less as individuals and more collectively, as faceless members of a terrorist conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","2790":"The raid today followed the discovery last week of what officials said was a plot to blow up a store on an American military base in Heidelberg. A German-born Turk and his girlfriend, a German-American woman who worked at the store, were arrested on suspicion of planning a bombing attack on or around Sept. 11. They had a photo of Osama bin Laden in their apartment and about 300 pounds of explosive chemicals. The Germans have praised the quick police action in Heidelberg, but, in fact, the tipoff came from American authorities, after a friend of the woman reported a warning to the military police.","2791":"At a local bookshop, three sales clerks were sipping tea. Their books were mostly on politics and literature, including a translation into Arabic of 'The Tin Drum' by G\u00fcnter Grass, and the works of a Moroccan novelist, Mohammed Shukri. A new book called 'The First War of the 21st Century,' featuring pictures of Osama bin Laden and President Bush on the cover, was attracting some attention, although the $4 price was stiff, they said.","2792":"One senior administration official who has been giving advance warning of the message to governments around the world said Mr. Bush 'won't set any deadlines,' nor will he propose a specific course of action. But just as the president told Congress last Sept. 20 that he was not willing to wait very long for the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden, the official said, 'he's not willing to wait very long for Saddam to allow the destruction of his weapons.'","2793":"Your Sept. 11 editorial, 'America Enduring,' was strangely reticent about those who perpetrated the evil that day last year. You did not mention that Osama bin Laden, for all we know, is still at large. And that with him are thousands of others like him.","2794":"In Afghanistan, he indicated that the hunt for Osama bin Laden might not be as important as strengthening government control over the countryside. 'My hunch is that more chances are that he is dead,' he said.","2795":"Q -- You are a prominent member of the antiterror coalition. Tell us what you can today about where Osama bin Laden is, whether you think he's dead or alive and how long the hunt for him is going to go on?","2796":"President Bush has formally changed the face of America's primary enemy from Osama bin Laden, whereabouts unknown, to Saddam Hussein, an old nemesis who cheated both Mr. Bush's father and President Clinton out of fulfillment of the terms of surrender that ended the 1991 Persian Gulf war.","2797":"In his speech, the president turned his campaign in a new direction, making no mention of Osama bin Laden or of nations his administration has identified as threats, like Iran and North Korea. He made only a passing reference to Al Qaeda.","2798":"LONDON, Sept. 12\u2014 Even as much of Britain mourned America's loss and its own on Sept. 11, Muslim leaders known here as supporters of holy war seized on the moment of grief to hail Osama bin Laden as a hero and to evoke the 'positive outcomes' of the attacks in New York and Washington.","28":"The military government has not given ground on the major American concerns: a timetable for the return of democracy, a crackdown on terrorists operating in Pakistan and help in persuading Pakistan's allies who control much of Afghanistan, the Taliban, to turn over Osama bin Laden, the terrorism suspect who is believed to be living there.","280":"The prosecution was allowed to reopen its case yesterday specifically to offer evidence that the killings of 18 American soldiers in Somalia in October 1993 were linked to a global terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","2800":"The Chinese report condemns a host of groups: an East Turkestan Liberation Organization; a 'Shock Brigade' of the Islamic Reformist Party; an East Turkestan Islamic Party; an East Turkestan Opposition Party; an East Turkestan Islamic Party of Allah; a Uighur Liberation Organization; the Islamic Holy Warriors; and an East Turkestan International Committee. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement does receive special mention for its purported close links to Osama bin Laden and for allegedly sending trained agents and weapons into Xinjiang in 1998.","2801":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 13\u2014 A federal judge in Chicago today threw out a perjury indictment against an Islamic charity and its leader, who were accused of lying about ties to Osama bin Laden and whether they had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","2802":"Mr. Khadr's 20-year-old brother, Abdul Rahman, who was born in Bahrain, was seized by Northern Alliance forces, the United States' allies, while fighting with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in November. Their father, Ahmed Said Khadr, an Egyptian-born Canadian citizen considered by Canadian intelligence officials to be a close associate of Osama bin Laden, is believed to be hiding in Pakistan or Afghanistan.","2803":"Last April, NRK traced Mr. Ahmad to Bierra, in northern Iraq, where he praised Osama bin Laden in an interview. He urged Norway not to back the United States in upcoming conflicts 'so that it won't suffer later.'","2804":"Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen who is acting as his own lawyer, has acknowledged his membership in the Qaeda terrorist network and his loyalty to Osama bin Laden. But he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. On the day of the attacks, he was in a Minnesota jail cell on immigration charges after arousing suspicion among instructors at a local flight school.","2805":"Osama bin Laden and his senior aides made no secret of their desire to buy or develop unconventional weapons. Testimony in terrorism trials in New York and other cities indicated that Al Qaeda was actively seeking nuclear and other unconventional weapons even in the early 1990's. Mr. bin Laden indicated that he considered the acquisition of such weapons a religious duty.","2807":"A mostly impoverished Muslim nation of 17 million people that borders Saudi Arabia, Yemen has proved a fertile recruiting ground for Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. On Friday, American officials confirmed the capture in Pakistan of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni who, officials said, served as a paymaster for the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks.","2808":"But what may be a rhetorical necessity for presidents is hardly a useful concept for policy makers. Terrorists come in many forms. Distinctions must be made, priorities set -- and America's priority is not with the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka or the Basque E.T.A. of Spain or the Shining Path of Peru. The terrorist enemies of the current conflict are the radical Islamists who are conducting a civilizational war against the West, so that when Dershowitz equates the nationalistic Yasir Arafat with the apocalyptic Osama bin Laden, he distorts more than he informs. No one worries about Arafat blowing up the Sistine Chapel. Washington may actually find it useful to work with some terrorists against the greater threat. It wouldn't be the first time that the United States set a thief to catch a thief: the criminal Stalin was our ally against the criminal Hitler. Even now, as Iran has fomented strife between the Israelis and the Palestinians, it has proved helpful in America's battle against the Taliban.","2809":"His arrest, coming at the same time as those of five American citizens of Yemeni descent in Buffalo, also provides a lift to the government's counterterrorism operation, which has often been criticized in the last year for its inability to penetrate Al Qaeda or determine whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead.","281":"The United Nations Drug Control Program had met resistance from the Clinton administration to any projects to assist Afghans in a drug-eradication program. American policy had been to isolate the Taliban and punish them through United Nations sanctions because of their refusal to turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant wanted in connection with bombings of two American Embassies in Africa. The United States may now have a less rigid policy.","2810":"Mr. Bakri's sister added that he had gone to Pakistan not to join Al Qaeda, but to study religion and to see what it was like living there. She said that he did not like it in Pakistan and that he had spoken of his disdain for Osama bin Laden.","2811":"If the apparently newsworthy interview got off-handed treatment initially, consider the source. The journalist, Yosri Fouda, works for Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network that has been Al Qaeda's news organization of choice. The same network last week was also broadcasting the latest Al Qaeda-produced video, which featured Osama bin Laden's voice offering a hagiographic tribute to the 19 hijackers.","2812":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16\u2014 The six men from western New York who have been accused of having ties to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network are being prosecuted under a broadly worded 1996 law that the Justice Department has depended on in several recent cases and that at least one federal judge has described as unconstitutional.","2813":"Mr. Bashir is an unapologetic admirer of Osama bin Laden, and easily expresses a loathing of American leaders and Jews. But he has steadfastly denied involvement in any terrorist activities.","2814":"Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is a Saudi of Yemeni descent, as were many of the Sept. 11 hijackers.","2815":"The emir started a satellite television channel, Al Jazeera, which is widely watched in the Arab world and beyond for its unrestrained reporting on Arab issues. It is Al Jazeera that has been a source of several tapes from Osama bin Laden.","2816":"A federal prosecutor asked a federal judge yesterday to rule that when Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a reputed official of Al Qaeda, stabbed a jail guard in late 2000, the act was related to terrorism and made Mr. Salim liable for a term of life imprisonment. The prosecutor, Robert Buehler, said that Mr. Salim, 44, who is accused of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden, was trying to take hostages and win the release of other terrorism suspects when he stabbed the guard. If the judge does not agree, Mr. Salim, who has pleaded guilty to the stabbing, could receive 14 to 17 years. His lawyer, Richard B. Lind, said that Mr. Salim never made hostage demands or sought to free other prisoners. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","2817":"Osama bin Laden himself appeared at the camp while the Lackawanna men were training, the affidavit says, and made a speech 'espousing anti-United States and Israel sentiments.'","2818":"In September 1998, intelligence agencies obtained information warning that Osama bin Laden's next major operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into an American airport and then detonating it. That same fall, another intelligence report stated that there was a Qaeda plot in the works that involved the use of aircraft in both New York and Washington.","2819":"The initial findings of a Congressional committee that has been reviewing the performance of America's intelligence agencies before Sept. 11 are profoundly disturbing. While the investigation has not found that the agencies collected information pointing to the date and targets of the attacks, it has discovered reports that Osama bin Laden and his followers hoped to hit sites in the United States and that they might employ commercial airliners as weapons. The response of spy organizations -- and the government at large -- was anemic.","282":"The testimony appeared to condemn what prosecutors say was a global anti-American conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden that included the 1998 African embassy bombings.","2820":"Mr. Salim, a Sudanese engineer and longtime associate of Osama bin Laden, set up the company in Istanbul in November 1996 at a time when Al Qaeda was expanding its financial reach from Afghanistan and Sudan into Europe. In the incorporation statement filed with the Turkish authorities, Mr. Salim said Maram would be involved in travel and in imports and exports.","2821":"Their arrest, following a tipoff to American military police, prompted immediate concerns that the couple was working on behalf of Al Qaeda, in part because a picture of Osama bin Laden was found in their apartment.","2822":"BUFFALO, Sept. 18\u2014 The government said today that soon after four of the seven men charged here as a cell of Al Qaeda arrived in Pakistan in the spring of 2001, supposedly for religious education, they were told 'you are going to meet the most wanted one,' meaning Osama bin Laden.","2823":"In addition, the Central Intelligence Agency issued a statement disputing other aspects of the committee's report, intensifying a battle between the intelligence community and the Congressional investigators examining the Sept. 11 failures. A C.I.A. spokesman, Bill Harlow, said that the joint committee report had badly undercounted the number of analysts and other resources that the agency had devoted to tracking Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda before the Sept. 11 attacks.","2824":"The judge in the case, Leonie M. Brinkema, has refused to make public several court filings made in recent weeks by Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen who has acknowledged that he is a Qaeda member loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2825":"Most centrally, the government has charged that the men's mere attendance at a notorious Qaeda camp, where Osama bin Laden himself spoke to the trainees about jihad, violated a 1996 federal law against providing 'material support or resources' for terrorists.","2826":"That statement may strike you as strange: wasn't the tax cut George W. Bush's central achievement before Osama bin Laden came along? But the tax cut was never intended as an economic policy: it was a political gesture designed to ward off a challenge from Steve Forbes and satisfy the conservative base. Only later did the administration make the providential discovery that it was also just the thing to fight recession, promote family values and cure the common cold.","2827":"The government, based on what it says are the statements of two of the men, says the men received training in terrorism and were witness to a speech by Osama bin Laden.","2828":"Saudi Arabia's connection to the Sept. 11 attacks has been a subject of intense investigation since it was learned last year that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens. The Saudi government has long distanced itself from Osama bin Laden, the son of a Yemen-born Saudi construction magnate, but United States officials are concerned about wealthy Saudis who have contributed millions of dollars to radical Islamist causes.","2829":"Mr. Faruq told his C.I.A. interrogators that when he arrived in Indonesia in 1998, having been sent by a top aide to Osama bin Laden, he linked up with Agus Dwikarna, an Indonesian businessman and member of Jemaah Islamiyah. He helped Mr. Dwikarna set up an organization, Laskar Jundullah, which carried out attacks on Christians in Sulawesi, intelligence officials said.","283":"Prosecutors have contended that the attack in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, was part of a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans that was led by Osama bin Laden and that also included the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998, which killed 224 people.","2832":"Yemen appears anxious to shake off its reputation as a haven for Islamic militants and has said it is holding 85 people arrested in a manhunt for members of Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden.","2833":"Over the last four decades of her life, Jordan focused her energies on the problem of violence in Lebanon and Northern Ireland, war crimes in the Balkans, apartheid in South Africa and, many years before Osama bin Laden prompted this country to care much about Afghan politics, the situation of women in Afghanistan. 'All my life I've been studying revolution,' Jordan wrote in 'Nicaragua: Why I Had to Go There,' her account of her travels through Nicaragua after the Sandinista-led revolution in 1979. 'I've been looking for it, pushing at the possibilities and waiting for that moment when there's no more room for rhetoric, for research or for reason: when there's only my life or my death left to act upon.' Jordan's untamed energy and take-no-prisoners attitude served her well as an activist. They have served her less well as an essayist, as shown by her last book, 'Some of Us Did Not Die.'","2835":"Next to Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mohammed is probably the most wanted terrorist in the world, because of what officials believe is his central role in the Sept. 11 plot and in Qaeda operations today. American intelligence officials say he has emerged as Al Qaeda's new chief of operations, succeeding Abu Zubaydah, who was captured in Pakistan in March and is in United States custody.","2837":"A satellite channel that has run tapes from Osama bin Laden and given sympathetic coverage to the Palestinians, Al Jazeera is also well placed geographically to outpace the Western networks on regional war coverage.","2838":"Mr. Bashir steadfastly denies a role in any terrorist activities, though expressing admiration for Osama bin Laden, who he says is not a terrorist.","2839":"Mr. Williams's July memo primarily focused on one individual who was a member of al-Muhajiroun, a group whose spiritual leader was a supporter of Osama bin Laden, the Congressional report stated. The group's spiritual leader had issued several fatwas, or religious decrees, against the United States, including 'one mentioning airports as a possible target,' the report said.","284":"Back in February, a prosecutor was questioning a government witness who had once worked for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged with leading a terrorism conspiracy against Americans that prosecutors say included the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa.","2840":"Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French national of Moroccan descent, has acknowledged that he is a member of the terrorism network of Al Qaeda and loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2841":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 24\u2014 President Bush ordered the country's terror alert level lowered to Code Yellow today for several factors cited by government officials. These include the disruption of a group near Buffalo whose members are accused of being in Al Qaeda and the capture of followers of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Singapore and Yemen.","2842":"At the end of his column, Minority Report, which will be in the issue that is mailed to subscribers this week, Mr. Hitchens writes: 'When I began work for The Nation over two decades ago, Victor Navasky described the magazine as a debating ground between liberals and radicals, which was, I thought, well judged. In the past few weeks, though, I have come to realize that the magazine itself takes a side in this argument, and is becoming the voice and the echo chamber of those who truly believe that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden.'","2843":"Although Mr. Moussaoui, 34, a French national, has admitted that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks.","2844":"During an animated discussion in the cool of an air-conditioned classroom on the desert campus here of the United Arab Emirates University, Thamina al-Sheraifi, 22, summed up: 'The war will create the same thing as Sept. 11. It will create more Osama bin Ladens. America didn't learn from Sept. 11. They can't understand that what happened is because of their ugly policies in this region.'","2847":"He also disagrees with many scholars and commentators -- Fouad Ajami, Olivier Roy and this reviewer, among others -- who have argued that the militant Islamic trend represented by Osama bin Laden has crested, at least in most Arab lands. On the contrary, he says, Islamism has been 'on the ascendant for a full quarter-century,' and is becoming ever more so.","2848":"With the uncertainties surrounding Osama bin Laden since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States -- whether he is alive or dead, in Afghanistan or Pakistan, or perhaps in some hide-out much farther afield -- this much is known: The last sightings of the leader of Al Qaeda of which pursuers can be reasonably certain were here in the White Mountains of southeastern Afghanistan.","2849":"In the years since, opposition to secular regimes has remained central to Islamist thinking. What has changed is the radicals' strategy for toppling these governments. After decades in which jihadists were defeated by security services in their home countries, Osama bin Laden and his followers decided that they would attack the 'far enemy,' the United States, which they believe is the primary source of strength for the secularist regimes in the Arab world. If the United States withdrew its support, the 'near enemy' that holds power in Muslim capitals would be unable to defend itself.","285":"Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are expected to begin closing arguments today in the trial of four men charged with joining a terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, which prosecutors say included the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa.","2850":"Mullah Omar was the leader of the Taliban movement, which swept to power in the mid-1990's and provided sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2851":"Mr. Moussaoui, 34, a Frenchman, has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and that he is loyal to Osama bin Laden. But he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks.","2852":"The uncertainty about Osama bin Laden is the best possible outcome for the United States. Resolving this uncertainty in either direction is likely to make things worse.","2853":"Mr. Brody, 49, does not think the United States, as in the case of Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein, should try to administer frontier justice. It is better, he insists, to work through world consensus and support the new International Criminal Court and the establishment of war-crimes tribunals.","2854":"'I think people would agree that New York City services for schools, libraries, police, even water and highways should not suffer because of Osama bin Laden,' Ms. Maloney said in a statement.","2855":"When Mr. Bratton was not at home or at the theater or movies in New York, the odds were good that at some point in the evening he would end up at Elaine's with friends. One was his former spokesman, John Miller, a television reporter who once chased John Gotti through town with a microphone and then chased down Osama bin Laden in the barren hills of Afghanistan.","2856":"When the bombs fall on Baghdad, as it seems increasingly likely they will, it will not be because Saddam Hussein is an evil man, but because we could not find Osama bin Laden. That is not pre-emption. It is aggression.","2858":"ALEXANDRIA, Va., Oct. 4\u2014 John Walker Lindh, the American who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, was sentenced to 20 years in prison today after sobbing through a 14-minute statement in which he repudiated terrorism, condemned Osama bin Laden and tried to explain why he joined the Afghan movement. But he stopped short of apologizing for anything other than causing his family so much pain.","2859":"'I am a member of Al Qaeda and I pledged to Osama bin Laden,' Mr. Reid, 29, a Briton, told Judge William G. Young in Federal District Court here. 'I am an enemy of your country.'","286":"Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Research your country\u2019s official policy on terrorism.

In his statement, he repudiated terrorism and condemned Osama bin Laden, but did not apologize for his actions.","2864":"Even now, most people consider human will indispensable for any muscular definition of evil. The case for this position was restated eloquently by Ron Rosenbaum in a recent article in The Atlantic Monthly about degrees of evil. If we're going to avoid the foolish complacency of moral relativism, Rosenbaum said, then we must see Osama bin Laden as fully conscious of his wickedness, not deluded by the belief that he was doing good. Otherwise we'd have to exonerate him. 'If we don't believe in ordinary, knowing wickedness,' Rosenbaum wrote, 'we can't condemn Hitler for anything more than a well-meaning ideological mistake or bin Laden for anything more than a well-meaning religious mistake.'","2865":"The campaign, which has also involved efforts to recruit the suspects' friends and family members as government informers, has raised alarm from civil liberties groups and some Arab-American and Muslim leaders. The men are suspected of ties to Al Qaeda or other groups affiliated with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.","2866":"Based on the statements of two of the men, the government says they received training in terrorism and heard a speech by Osama bin Laden.","2867":"It is quite a change. For three years, bearded fighters from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan descended during thaws to skirmish with government soldiers. It was Central Asia's largest militant group, financed by Osama bin Laden, given refuge in Afghanistan by the Taliban and included on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations. Its incursions, and the accusation that it was behind an assassination attempt on the Uzbek president, Islam Karimov, in 1999, ensured that it was studied for signs that the brand of Islam used by the Taliban might spread.","2868":"Photo: One year after the United States started bombing in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, left, with Gen. Peter Pace of the Marines, vowed yesterday that Osama bin Laden and associates would be found. (Reuters)","287":"The Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, seeking 'to export jihad' and 'fulfill his dream, his view of how he thought the world should work,' created a terrorism conspiracy that led to the bombings of the United States Embassies in East Africa in 1998, a federal prosecutor said yesterday.","2870":"As so many people seem to have done here in the suburbs in the last few days, Ms. Jacobs said she found herself thinking about the sniper in the same sometimes furious, sometimes frightened way she has thought of Osama bin Laden.","2871":"And, the judge said, the evidence of the young men's presence at the Qaeda camp in Afghanistan raised several questions: Were they recruited? How did they get into Afghanistan if their passports showed no visas or stamps? How did they enter the secret training camp and hear a speech by Osama bin Laden? And what, asked the judge, was their 'objective in attending said training camp and to what use or purpose was such training to be put?'","2872":"Mr. Freeh replied: 'Absolutely. In 1999, not only had we indicted Osama bin Laden twice, he was on our Top 10 list. Al Qaeda was the No. 1 priority.'","2873":"The audacity of the crusade's ambitions is matched by the magnitude of its risks. Before Sept. 11, the Islamist radicals had been on the run, their project flagging. They had turned their talents on the United States -- the distant power that lay behind the thrones in Riyadh and Cairo -- only after suffering defeat on the primary battlegrounds of Algeria and Egypt and Saudi Arabia. By invading and occupying Iraq and using it as a base to remake the region, the United States risks revitalizing the political project embodied by Osama bin Laden. It is not only that Islamic radicalism may gain new life and new converts but that moderate regimes will be threatened and will respond harshly, leading them not toward democracy but away from it, and that, finally, the force to which the United States remains most vulnerable -- terror -- will once again visit our shores. And this time, terror may come not just from a reanimated Al Qaeda but from Hezbollah and other groups that heretofore saw the American threat as not quite so direct. To divide the world into good and evil, however effective that is as a means of building political support and however gratifying that may be to Americans who see their country as a 'city on a hill,' risks broadening a war that would be better kept narrowly defined.","2874":"The question before him was whether to keep six men from nearby Lackawanna behind bars until their trial on charges of supporting Al Qaeda by attending an Afghanistan training camp months before the Sept. 11 attack. The judge was on fresh terrain, negotiating between the lack of evidence that the men were planning an attack and the question of why young Americans of Yemeni descent wound up in the clutches, if only for a moment, of Osama bin Laden.","2875":"The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it did not have 'information on a specific time, date or location of an attack' but said the warning was prompted by threats contained in audio tapes of two leaders of Al Qaeda broadcast in recent days. In one of the tapes, broadcast on Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based Arabic language satellite television network, Osama bin Laden's chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatened attacks on the United States economy.","2876":"The protesters rallied as Attorney General John Ashcroft held a news conference inside the building to announce the seven-count indictment, which accuses Enaam M. Arnaout, 40, of money laundering, fraud and conspiracy to engage in racketeering as executive director of the charity, the Benevolence International Foundation, based in Chicago. Mr. Arnaout has been in federal custody here since April, charged with perjury in lying about ties to Osama bin Laden.","2877":"'It's like my heart is on fire,' Mrs. Akel said as she contemplated the accelerating cycle of violence. She sat on a flowered cushion among a crowd of grandchildren in the family home here, its walls plastered with pictures of the dead, including her son; of Osama bin Laden, and of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas.","2879":"The man, Enaam M. Arnaout, 40, a father of four from suburban Chicago, faces up to 90 years in prison if convicted on the seven counts in the federal indictment, which alleges that his charity, the Benevolence International Foundation, was a financial front for Osama bin Laden's terrorist activities.","288":"Estimates of the guerrillas' strength range from a few hundred to several thousand. There are sketchy but widely circulated stories that the militants are trained by the Taliban and receive money from drug traffickers and from Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of leading an international terrorist group.","2880":"LOS ANGELES\u2014 On Wednesday, the government indicted Enaam M. Arnaout, the leader of the Benevolence International Foundation, a prominent Muslim charity, on charges that he helped finance Osama bin Laden's terrorist activities.","2881":"The F.B.I. said the warning, transmitted to state and local law enforcement agencies, was prompted by threats contained in recently broadcast recorded statements by Osama bin Laden and his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. When the bin Laden statement was taped is not known, but F.B.I. officials said they believed Mr. Zawahiri's tape was made in recent weeks.","2882":"Those questions have grown more urgent with the recent assaults against American marines in Kuwait and the release of audio tapes attributed to Osama bin Laden and one of his chief lieutenants, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Mr. Zawahiri's tape, which officials said was more likely to be genuine and recently made than the bin Laden tape, threatens new attacks against the United States and couches its anti-American message around the possibility of an American-led war against Iraq.","2883":"This exchange is followed by a montage, accompanied by Louis Armstrong singing 'What a Wonderful World,' of American foreign policy misdeeds from the 1950's to the present. Their relevance is, again, arguable, but by now it should be clear that Mr. Moore is less interested in argument than in provocation. The last image is of the airplanes smashing into the World Trade Center, accompanied by this text: 'Sept. 11, 2001: Osama bin Laden uses his expert C.I.A. training to murder 3,000 people.'","2884":"The combination of those forces is apparently what drove two young Kuwaiti men to a suicidal attack this week that killed one American marine and wounded another. Kuwaiti government officials say the assault was carried out with the help of other militants who were also planning a larger attack. Several of those people are now in custody; it is not yet clear whether they have direct links to Al Qaeda, the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden.","2885":"A total of 15 people have been charged with aiding the attack, led by Anas Ahmad Ibrahim al-Kandari. Mr. Kandari, 21, who was killed with his cousin in the attack, had said in a videotaped message that he had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, the Kuwaiti minister said.","2886":"No, like Osama bin Laden, this shooter seems to get his thrills from seeing the fear in the eyes of the survivors -- after he randomly kills his victims as if they were deer. And like bin Laden, this shooter is a loser who combines evil, cunning, technical prowess, a world stage and a willingness to kill everyday people doing everyday things to magnify that fear. By gunning down people pumping gas, mowing lawns and walking to school, the shooter is making America's capital area squirm. That's power. No wonder the note he apparently left said, 'I am God.'","2887":"Plenty of problems persist. Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, may or may not still be alive, and Mullah Mohammed Omar, the former head of the Taliban, remains at large. Efforts to train a new multi-ethnic Afghan national army that would bolster the central government's authority in lawless regions of the country have taken longer than expected. Regional warlords are feuding, posing new challenges to President Hamid Karzai's government. Aid has been slow to reach many parts of the country.","2888":"The group's latest round of attacks may be a response to the Bush administration's Iraq policy, the officials said. An audiotape of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatened continued attacks on 'America and its allies,' and denounced American plans to attack Iraq.","2889":"In the name of those objectives, the American people would most likely be willing to pay billions of dollars a year, as long as it seems that American soil is secure from the likes of Osama bin Laden. We should not forget that the United States has a long history of military occupation in the Caribbean and Central America in the name of democracy and stability in the region. Why should Iraq and the Middle East be any different?","289":"The defendant, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, has been portrayed by his lawyers as an Islamic soldier who was dedicated to the cause of Osama bin Laden but would not have participated in an operation that killed innocent people because it would have violated the tenets of Islam.","2890":"Enamm M. Arnaout, a Syrian-born Chicago resident, was so close to Osama bin Laden in the late 1980's, F.B.I. officials say, that he once looked after one of his wives. Mr. Aranout's alleged links to Al Qaeda led to his indictment, which alleged that as the leader of an Islamic foundation, he diverted money to Al Qaeda. Lawyers for Mr. Arnaout called the charges baseless. Eric Lichtblau","2891":"MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md.\u2014 In the endless media psychoanalysis and police profiling of the random murderer striking fear near the nation's capital, one possibility is rarely mentioned: that the sniper may be a terrorist affiliated with Al Qaeda or otherwise inspired by Osama bin Laden.","2892":"When Australian troops were in East Timor, which is predominately Christian, in support of that country's transition to independence from Indonesia, Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, publicly accused Australia of being on a crusade to break up Muslim Indonesia.","2893":"For years Al Qaeda aligned itself with other militant groups, providing training and sometimes financing and planning. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden established the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, which trained at least 10,000 potential fighters in eastern Afghanistan.","2894":"Unfortunately, there are many others who applaud Osama bin Laden for having the guts to take on the infidels. The suspicion and hostility we face in the Islamic world will be one of our central challenges in the coming years, particularly after any invasion of Iraq. Look at Pakistan, our supposed ally in the war on terrorism. The most common name given to Pakistani boys born after 9/11 in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province reportedly was Osama -- that's right, Osama.","2895":"This was the latest and deadliest of several recent assaults. Together they offer evidence that Al Qaeda and its allies have survived the war in Afghanistan and are regrouping to organize new strikes. Two weeks ago Kuwaiti terrorists opened fire on American marines who were in the country for joint exercises with the Kuwaiti military, killing one of them. One of the assailants left behind a tape pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Yesterday more gunfire was directed at American troops in Kuwait. Late last month a French oil tanker was set ablaze off Yemen in what Paris believes was a terrorist attack. Meanwhile a new tape by Osama bin Laden's top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has begun circulating. American authorities believe it was recorded recently.","2896":"The president said that the attacks showed once again that the campaign against terrorism would be a protracted one, and that his administration had a long struggle ahead. The president said that he did not know whether Osama bin Laden was dead or alive but that he did know that 'there are still some of his top lieutenants roaming around' and that Al Qaeda remains dangerous.","2897":"KUWAIT, Oct. 14\u2014 Gunmen fired at American marines in northern Kuwait early today, the United States Embassy here said, less than a week after a marine was killed in an attack here by a man professing allegiance to Osama bin Laden.","2898":"The man was turned over to Sudanese authorities at Khartoum airport. Sudanese television showed images of passengers leaving the jetliner by inflatable emergency slides. The Interior Ministry said the plane was swept for explosives and given permission to resume its journey. The attempted hijacking of a Saudi Arabian plane raised more than the usual interest because the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia has been strongly denounced by religious conservatives in the Islamic world, as well as by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi citizen who lived in Sudan in the 1990's before being expelled and moving to Afghanistan. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were from Saudi Arabia.","2899":"With so little known about the gunman, the experts say, it is possible he may have some political agenda. Moreover, the killings have aroused precisely the kind of anxiety that many people equate with terrorist acts. The shootings have also occurred at the same time as a surge in violence associated with Islamic extremism and Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network.","29":"Their tasks are made harder by the world's scorn. The Taliban are notorious for imposing a puritanical Islam that includes the head-to-toe sheathing of women and justice by amputation. Only three nations recognize them as Afghanistan's legitimate government. In November, the United Nations -- at Washington's urging -- imposed economic sanctions against the Taliban for their refusal to hand over their guest, the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.","290":"A defense lawyer in the embassy bombings trial charged yesterday that a crucial government witness who was a former aide to Osama bin Laden had lied repeatedly, to the American authorities to win protection for himself, and again when he took the witness stand.","2900":"Sometimes he posted queries on topics like manufacturing nerve gas at home. Once, he shared the results of an experiment with a highly volatile explosive that he set off in a metal breath-mint box. Often he traded information with the site's moderator, who used the screen name Einstein and whose message carried a picture of his own face superimposed on Osama bin Laden's body, complete with turban and beard.","2901":"In another abrupt about-face, Mr. Yudhoyono conceded that the organization's leader is Abu Bakar Bashir, a 64-year-old preacher who runs an Islamic boarding school in central Java. Mr. Bashir, who expresses admiration for Osama bin Laden and loathing for Jews and the West, has steadfastly denied that there is any such group as Jemaah Islamiyah.","2902":"Despite the lapses, the C.I.A. director insisted that his agency had long been aware of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden's terror network. He said that with the creation of the agency's bin Laden 'issue station' in 1996, the C.I.A. had been engaged in a sustained, high-priority effort to disrupt Al Qaeda.","2903":"Mr. Moussaoui, 34, of France, was indicted in December in Alexandria, Va., near the Pentagon, on federal terrorism charges and is awaiting trial. Although he has acknowledged in court that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has insisted he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 conspiracy.","2904":"A declared admirer of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Bashir said tonight that he was aware of reports that he was to be questioned. In a telephone interview, he said, laughingly, that there were no police at his house yet.","2905":"Yemen, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, has been trying to shed its image as a haven for Islamic militants since 17 United States servicemen were killed in the suicide bombing of the destroyer Cole in Aden Harbor in October 2000.","2906":"With his customary confidence, Mr. Bashir, 64, who is an unabashed admirer of Osama bin Laden, said at a news conference in Solo this afternoon that he would go to Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, as requested. He appeared as strong as ever when he delivered his standard tirades. 'The Americans and Jews are the terrorists,' he said.","2907":"'Just like resources have been made available for fighting Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, we want the same thing available for the citizens in Baltimore City,' Mr. McFadden said. 'We consider this an absolute terrorist attack on the community.'","2908":"A year ago, most Americans thought they knew what Al Qaeda was: an organization led by Osama bin Laden pursuing a vague Islamic ideology, with a base and training camps in Afghanistan and cells of operatives around the globe. The cells were thought to operate either on signals from the top or to some extent on their own initiative.","2909":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 19\u2014 An Iraqi official who is part of President Saddam Hussein's inner circle has said the government has had no links with Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, denying a charge made by President Bush.","291":"Last fall, Ali A. Mohamed, a former sergeant in the United States Army, pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. At that time, he told the judge that Osama bin Laden had looked at a photograph of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and 'pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber.'","2910":"Muslim outrage could also make it much more difficult to keep the nuclear materials now in Pakistan out of terrorist hands. The Pakistani public has been encouraged to consider its nuclear weapons 'Islamic bombs.' President Pervez Musharraf seems to be making a serious effort to bring Islamic fanatics under control, but most likely their sympathizers still infest his government. Even a successful invasion of Iraq could have the perverse effect of increasing the threat we had tried to eliminate. While Saddam Hussein can, with determined effort, be deterred, Osama bin Laden and his like cannot.","2911":"If they line up with the Bush administration against Saddam Hussein, they risk alienating a large and volatile domestic constituency, with unpredictable consequences. (Witness this month's elections in Pakistan, where two provinces adjacent to Afghanistan are now controlled by a coalition of religious parties sympathetic to Osama bin Laden.) But if they acknowledge popular opposition to a war with Iraq, they will incur Mr. Bush's wrath. Either way the war on terror suffers.","2913":"Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and part of Saddam Hussein's inner circle, said the Iraqi government has had no links with Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, denying a charge made by President Bush. 13","2914":"The ease with which one can buy weapons at gun shows has not gone unnoticed by groups like Al Qaeda, which pointed this out in one of its training manuals. According to the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy group, Osama bin Laden's agents in the United States purchased 25 high-powered sniper rifles to use in their war against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the late 1980's. What would stop them from using the guns against us at home?","2915":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia\u2014 Osama bin Laden succeeded magnificently, it seems, in at least one of his goals: creating a rift between the United States and Saudi Arabia.","2916":"The government, on the basis of what it said were the statements of two of the men, said the men had received training in terrorism and had witnessed a speech by Osama bin Laden.","2917":"Mr. Moussaoui has said he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, but he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks. He was arrested on immigration charges in August 2001 in Minnesota after arousing the suspicion of his instructors at a flight school.","2918":"This is an important distinction. The 'Arab street' is the broad mass of public opinion, which is largely passive and nonviolent. The 'Arab basement' is where small groups of hard-core ideologues, such as Osama bin Laden and his gang, have retreated and where they are mixing fertilizer, C-4 plastic explosives and gasoline to make the bombs that have killed Westerners all over the world.","2919":"Osama bin Laden, whose family's roots lie in Yemen, attracted many followers from this country. After the Taliban and Al Qaeda were routed, it was believed many would seek refuge in Yemen -- not least because Mr. bin Laden suggested they would all be welcome here.","292":"Television needs pictures, but security has made art hard to come by at the federal trial in Manhattan of four men charged with joining a conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden to bomb two United States Embassies in Africa.","2920":"The most contentious exchange came when the moderator, Tim Russert, host of NBC's 'Meet the Press,' asked Mr. McBride if he condemned remarks by a prominent Miami minister and McBride supporter comparing the Bush family to Osama bin Laden and neo-Nazis. Mr. McBride said he did condemn the remarks by the Rev. Victor Curry, president of the Miami N.A.A.C.P., but Governor Bush suggested that the condemnation did not go far enough.","2921":"This does not mean that Al Qaeda and Iraq have not had contacts or even collaborated over the past 5 or 10 years. Both hate America. And despite the fact that their ideologies are mutually antagonistic -- Mr. Hussein's regime is based on notions of secular Arab nationalism that Osama bin Laden detests -- they have much in common and are clearly capable of putting aside their differences for tactical ends.","2922":"Mounir el-Motassadeq, a man accused by German prosecutors of being a member of Mohamed Atta's terrorist cell, reversed his earlier claims and admitted that he had attended a training camp sponsored by Osama bin Laden. But he pleaded not guilty to charges that included accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people and denied that he was a member of Al Qaeda. A11","2923":"HAMBURG, Germany, Oct. 22\u2014 On the opening day of the first trial in Europe related to the Sept. 11 attacks, a man accused by German prosecutors of being a member of Mohamed Atta's terrorist cell reversed his earlier claims and admitted that he had attended a training camp sponsored by Osama bin Laden.","2924":"In particular, many in the intelligence agencies disagree that Mr. Hussein can be directly linked to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, or that the two are likely to make common cause against the United States. In addition, the view among even some senior intelligence analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency is that Mr. Hussein is contained and is unlikely to unleash weapons of mass destruction unless he is attacked.","2925":"American officials insist they know of no evidence to support the suit's principle accusations, including its charge that Prince Sultan 'publicly supported and funded several Islamic charities that were sponsoring Osama bin Laden.'","2926":"LONDON, Oct. 25\u2014 The British authorities were reported today to have arrested a fugitive Islamic cleric known as Abu Qatada, wanted in the United States and Europe as an emissary of Osama bin Laden and labeled by a British legislator 'some sort of Muslim Scarlet Pimpernel.'","2927":"The British authorities are reported to have arrested a fugitive Islamic cleric, wanted in the United States and Europe as an emissary of Osama bin Laden. British authorities declined to confirm the reports.

PAGE A9","293":"Lawyers for two defendants in the embassy bombings trial sharply distanced their clients yesterday from the views of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, saying they had never agreed with his calls for killing Americans around the world.","2931":"Yemen is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, and some here see him as a kind of archetype holy warrior. Hundreds if not thousands of Yemenis passed through camps in Afghanistan; Yemenis have been involved in many major terrorist incidents in recent years; and at least 53 are among the prisoners at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Station in Cuba.","2932":"In Germany, during the opening of the first trial related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mounir el-Motassadeq, accused of providing support for the Hamburg cell of Mohammed Atta and others, admitted that he attended a training camp in Afghanistan sponsored by Osama bin Laden. He denied knowing that his friends, including three of the Sept. 11 suicide pilots, had intended to commit terrorist acts. Desmond Butler","2933":"Mr. Grucci's commercials accused Mr. Bishop of covering up rapes at Southampton College, from which he is on leave as provost, and of opposing the execution of Osama bin Laden. In a debate taped for broadcast at 7 p.m. Monday on Cablevision's Channel 12, Mr. Bishop denied the charges as 'vile and vicious' and 'completely untrue.'","2934":"The terrorist network that Osama bin Laden has stealthily built up in Southeast Asia over the past decade is still largely intact, intelligence officials in several countries said in interviews over the last week. It may even have become more deadly and more virulently anti-American than it was a year ago, and harder to detect. A1","2935":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, Oct. 27\u2014 The terrorist network that Osama bin Laden has stealthily built up in Southeast Asia over the past decade is largely intact, intelligence officials in several countries said in interviews over the last week. It may even have become more deadly and more virulently anti-American than it was a year ago, they say.","2936":"His Republican challenger, Saxby Chambliss, a four-term United States representative from Macon, is accusing Mr. Cleland of undermining the fight against terrorism by voting against President Bush's domestic security legislation 11 times. One of Mr. Chambliss's more provocative advertisements, which he revised after a storm of criticism, even flashed pictures of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein before snapshots of Mr. Cleland, to make sure no one missed the point.","2937":"Thomas L. Friedman says the 'Arab basement' -- 'hard-core ideologues, such as Osama bin Laden and his gang' -- doesn't want Israel to exist (column, Oct. 23). He need not have limited this to those in the 'basement.' The children of Palestinians are taught by their schools and media to hate Israelis. Israel is absent on many of their maps.","2938":"The international war against terrorism, and strong evidence that some Chechen rebels have received training and support from Al Qaeda, has emboldened Mr. Putin to equate his struggle against the guerrillas with America's campaign against Osama bin Laden and his followers. While there are common elements, the Chechens have some legitimate grievances about a long history of harsh Russian rule. Mr. Putin should recognize that he cannot end their insurrection through force alone. If the United States wants to be helpful, it should not give Mr. Putin a pat on the back after this debacle and tell him we are all fighting the same enemy.","2939":"The Web site began operating three years ago in Doha, Qatar, where its technical and corporate offices are located. Qatar's leader, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, has made efforts to create a more open, liberal atmosphere. Another prominent result of that openness is Al Jazeera television, which has broadcast messages by Osama bin Laden and his confederates, and has drawn criticism from governments across the Arab world for its outspoken ways. The Qatari royal family, which finances Al Jazeera, is a major supporter of the Web site, according to its deputy editor, Hossam el-Din el-Sayed.","294":"Mr. Cohn and Mr. Ruhnke each emphasized their clients' youth -- at the time of the bombings, Mr. al-'Owhali was 21 and Mr. Mohamed was 25. Both lawyers also disputed that their clients had knowingly joined any global conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden to kill Americans.","2940":"President Mohammad Khatami of Iran said that his country opposed a war against Iraq and contended that a misguided campaign against terrorism by the United States had strenghtened support for Osama bin Laden in the Muslim world.

We don't know who sent the anthrax letters. Another Qaeda attack could be coming at any moment. The economy is imploding. The crime rate is rising.","2942":"MADRID, Oct. 29\u2014 In a sharp criticism of the United States, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran said today that his country opposed a war against neighboring Iraq and charged that Washington's misguided campaign against terrorism had strengthened support for Osama bin Laden in the Muslim world.","2944":"'You must give me this tape -- it is the proof that this is a conspiracy to murder me by you,' wrote Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French national who has admitted in open court that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2945":"Mr. Lesin drew a parallel with moves by the United States, which has put pressure on television networks to broadcast no more than snippets of videotapes issued by Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders. The White House has argued in part that the videos may contain hidden information for terrorists in hiding.","2946":"There is a scene in this important book that tells a great deal about the failure of the American government to prevent the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In 1999, a National Security Council staffer was meeting with a pair of F.B.I. officials at the White House. The N.S.C. man was excited and surprised to learn from some old press clippings that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the much-feared Egyptian terrorist and deputy to Osama bin Laden, had visited the United States on a fund-raising trip in the early 1990's. 'I couldn't believe it,' he exclaimed to the F.B.I. men. 'Did you know that?' The two gumshoes nodded warily. 'Well,' the staffer continued, 'if he was here, someone was handling his travel and arranging his meetings and someone was giving him money. Do you know who these people are? Do you have them covered? There are cells here and we need to know about them.' 'Yeah, yeah, we know. Don't worry about it,' the F.B.I. officials replied.","2947":"When the C.I.A. failed to find any significant link between Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network and Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, the Pentagon set up a competing intelligence unit this fall under Douglas J. Feith, under secretary for policy. It trolls through millions of intelligence reports for nuggets to show that Iraq might be connected to the Sept. 11 attacks.","2948":"One of the most provocative commercials flashed pictures of Osama bin Laden and then blasted Mr. Cleland, 60, for voting against the president 11 times on domestic security.","2949":"Mr. Grucci tried to paint Mr. Bishop, 52, who is on leave from Southampton College, as the beneficiary of wealthy special interests, but he lost some of his incumbent's advantage when he ran commercials that accused Mr. Bishop of covering up rapes of students at Southampton, and of opposing the execution of Osama bin Laden. The advertising backfired.","295":"In his rebuttal, Mr. Fitzgerald attacked the defense's position that one of the defendants, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, had never joined a terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans led by Osama bin Laden.","2950":"Last November, a Predator operated by the C.I.A. was used to coordinate a strike in which one of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenants, Muhammad Atef, was killed in Kabul.","2951":"'Pakistan' is a valuable and information-rich, if also ramshackle and meandering, portrait of a poor and deeply divided country that, she says, could very well become the next of the world's failed states -- like Egypt, the subject of her previous book. The main thrust of Ms. Weaver's account, as her subtitle suggests, is to illustrate the ways in which Pakistan has been changed by the decade-long war fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the rise of the militant Islamic groups fighting jihad, or holy war, Osama bin Laden's Qaeda and the recently deposed Afghan Taliban among them. Ms. Weaver's findings are not surprising, but they are worthy of attention because of Pakistan's special circumstances.","2952":"'Yasir Arafat' and the revived best seller from last year, 'Osama bin Laden,' were already all but gone -- a reflection that the plight of the Palestinians and the fight against terrorism remain the preoccupations of the moment.","2953":"His central theme is that Wahhabism has over the centuries waged a bitter struggle against all other variants of Islam, most particularly the tolerant, peaceful, poetically mystical schools of thought that, in Mr. Schwartz's view, are the true and admirable historic Islam. Moreover, he maintains that Wahhabism, which gave rise to Osama bin Laden and the Afghan Taliban among others, is the most dread menace faced in the world today by the forces of tolerance and pluralism, whether Muslim or otherwise.","2954":"The group was led by a senior lieutenant of Osama bin Laden and included a Qaeda explosives expert, who was later arrested and told American officials of the January meeting during his interrogation.","2955":"A Western diplomat said tonight that according to Indonesian law enforcement officials, a search of Mr. Amrozi's house had turned up compact discs featuring Osama bin Laden.","2956":"In a two-hour interview at the modest two-story villa in the Baghdad suburb of Zeiyunia that serves as headquarters for his Palestine Liberation Front, an offshoot of Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, Mr. Abbas spoke contemptuously of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2957":"Nearly every Democratic leader is offering a variation on Dick Gephardt's excuse -- that 9/11 shrouded the election, to the White House's advantage. But if conservatives are rarely more irritating than when they wrap themselves in the flag, liberals are surely at their most annoying when donning the veil of victimhood. The Democrats were not done in by Osama bin Laden or the media or anyone other than themselves. Their intellectual vacuity in this year's campaign was apparent well before 9/11.","2958":"The first two editions can be found on bookshelves of principals, policy makers and parents around the world, in editions in English, Dutch, German and Swedish. These early versions show their age, though. They are silent on matters like the Internet, Osama bin Laden and global positioning systems, and virtually prelapsarian on the political state of China, national borders and popular music. 'The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy' is every bit as weighty as its progenitors, with more than 600 new entries (for a total of 6,900) and 23 sections, touching on everything from aerobic exercise to H. Ross Perot to Zionism.","2959":"'Don't even look at them,' wrote Ms. Fallaci, who also recommended that Florentines shutter the entire city. She said the protesters were demanding peace from Mr. Bush, but not from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or Osama bin Laden.","296":"A federal jury in Manhattan began deliberations yesterday in the trial of four men who, federal prosecutors said, conspired in the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people. The jury asked to review 19 pieces of evidence, including maps, grand jury testimony and a declaration by Osama bin Laden, who is said to have led the conspiracy. If convicted, two of the defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, above, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, could face the death penalty. Wadih El-Hage, 40, and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 27, could face life sentences.","2960":"Precautions may well be warranted. On Dec. 14, 1999, United States Customs officials at Port Angeles, Wash., arrested a 32-year-old man who had arrived on a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, after the trunk of his rented car was found to contain 100 pounds of ingredients for bomb-making. The man, Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian, admitted later that he had plotted to set off a bomb at Los Angeles International Airport, and that he had received money and training at camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden.","2961":"Mr. Bush confronts other risks. After nearly two years of attributing the economy's troubles variously to a hangover from the Clinton years, Osama bin Laden, obstructionists in the Democratic Senate and the business cycle, the president will most likely be forced to take full political ownership of the economy.","2962":"Although Mr. Motassadeq has admitted that he knew other alleged cell members and that he spent time at a training camp in Afghanistan sponsored by Osama bin Laden, he denies knowing of any terrorist plans.","2963":"A youngster who committed suicide by crashing into a Tampa office building nearly hit the control tower at an Air Force base with a nerve center for the Afghan war, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot, Charles Bishop, 15, of Palm Harbor, flew his stolen Cessna 'just a few feet' over the control tower at MacDill Air Force Base on Jan. 5, the report by the board said. It did not speculate whether Mr. Bishop, who left a suicide note expressing admiration for Osama bin Laden, had intended the base as his target. The base is home to the Central Command, which has a crucial role in directing combat in Afghanistan. When a Coast Guard helicopter tried to force Mr. Bishop to land, he flew toward Tampa, the report said. Mr. Bishop slammed the four-seat plane into the 28th floor of the Bank of America Plaza. Nobody else was hurt.","2964":"Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network, broadcast an audio tape it said was recorded by Osama bin Laden in which he praised several violent attacks around the world, including recent ones in Moscow and Bali, and threatened further bloodshed over Iraq. A1","2965":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 12\u2014 Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television channel, broadcast an audiotape today that it said was recorded by Osama bin Laden in which he praised several terror attacks around the world, including recent ones in Moscow and Bali, and threatened further bloodshed over Iraq.","2966":"The government's assessment so far that it cannot be absolutely certain that the audiotape broadcast on Tuesday was recorded by Osama bin Laden does not surprise experts in the field of voice authentication.","2967":"Since the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush has focused his attention either on Osama bin Laden or on the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein. Yesterday he had to deal with both at once. Just as experts were asserting that a new tape from Mr. bin Laden appeared to be authentic -- meaning the master terrorist is probably alive and plotting -- Mr. Hussein announced his acceptance of the new United Nations resolution aimed at disarming his regime.","2968":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 13\u2014 The White House has been told that government linguistics experts believe the voice on a new audiotape praising recent terror attacks and broadcast on Arab television is Osama bin Laden's, administration officials said today.","2969":"Administration officials said government linguists believed that a new audiotape broadcast on Arab television contained the voice of Osama bin Laden. But initial analysis by electronics experts could not determine whether the tape was genuine. A1","297":"A federal judge in the embassy bombings trial ordered the government yesterday to turn over to the defense records of any secret deals that it has made with certain informants who have agreed to cooperate in the investigation of Osama bin Laden. The order covers people who were members of what the government calls Mr. bin Laden's terrorist conspiracy.","2970":"LONDON, Nov. 13\u2014 Governments of Western countries named as potential targets of terrorist attacks in an audiotape purporting to contain the voice of Osama bin Laden said today that they were treating the tape's message seriously but that the implication that Mr. bin Laden is alive had not forced them to change security arrangements.","2971":"Following are excerpts from an audiotape broadcast in Arabic this week by Al Jazeera and attributed to Osama bin Laden, as recorded and translated by Reuters.","2973":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 14\u2014 American intelligence agencies came under renewed attack in Congress today for failing to find Osama bin Laden, with the increasing certainty that he is still alive prompting senior Democratic senators to brand the effort to dismantle Al Qaeda as a failure.","2974":"You have to wonder how Osama bin Laden is reacting as he watches our administration scramble after his alleged resurfacing ('As New Tape Is Evaluated, Bush Calls Qaeda Threat Real,' front page, Nov. 14).","2975":"This August, Mr. Elmardoudi was indicted with three other men on a charge of providing support to terrorists and another charge relating to visa fraud. The indictment said the men were part of a terror cell directed by Mr. Elmardoudi, referred to as Abdella in the indictment. Though the indictment against the men drew ideological links to Osama bin Laden, they were not specifically linked to Al Qaeda.","2976":"A chain reaction has been set in motion, giving sanction and inspiration to thousands of Osama bin Laden's followers. We ignore this essential fact at our own peril, and should have been doing more to safeguard our country since that date.","2977":"On Sept. 17, 2001, George W. Bush evoked images of America's frontier justice when he promised that we would get Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.'","2978":"WASHINGTON\u2014 In past weeks Al Qaeda has relaunched itself, a rebranding that presages a second phase in its war against the West. The clearest evidence for this shift is in three audiotapes that Al Qaeda has released since the beginning of October from its top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri.","2979":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 14\u2014 The audiotape that appears to be Osama bin Laden's latest message to the world was handed over by a man on the street here two days ago, the correspondent for Al Jazeera who received it said.","298":"In the time it took to pack a bag, I was on my way to the airport. Ten weeks later, I was still in Yemen, reporting on the aftermath of the Islamic terrorist bombing that killed 17 sailors and did $240 million in damage to the ship. As I write this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still hunting the culprits, believed to have been inspired or directed by Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist.","2980":"Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister, in addressing the French Senate today talked about a threatening audiotape message attributed to Osama bin Laden that mentions France. But he said the police knew of no precise attacks planned against the country.","2981":"American intelligence agencies came under renewed attack in Congress for failing to find Osama bin Laden, with the increasing certainty that he is still alive prompting senior Democratic senators to brand the effort to dismantle Al Qaeda a failure. A1","2982":"He was not, they said, one of the most widely recognized Qaeda leaders -- Osama bin Laden or his senior deputies, Ayman al-Zawahiri or Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.","2983":"He also said he met Osama bin Laden there. 'I love him a lot, like a father,' he said. 'For me, he's my father. I don't care what happened on Sept. 11 or what he did, that doesn't interest me.","2984":"One reason the six-week rally may be slowing is the renewed focus on terrorist attacks since the surfacing of a tape earlier this week attributed to Osama bin Laden. Then on Thursday, the F.B.I. issued a terrorist attack alert that said: 'In selecting its next targets, sources suggest Al Qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological trauma.'","2985":"Twice in the past week, George W. Bush has been called 'Pharaoh' in missives from the Middle East. The word was uttered by the voice on an audiotape broadcast by Al Jazeera, which may or may not have been that of Osama bin Laden, and it also appeared in the recent letter from Naji Sabri, the Iraqi foreign minister, to Kofi Annan accepting the return of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq. 'Go thou to Pharaoh,' Mr. Sabri's letter begins, quoting from the Koran, 'for he has indeed transgressed all bounds. But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear.' These are the words Allah speaks to Moses and his brother Aaron in the sura, or section, called Ta-Ha. Unlike Mr. Sabri, Allah did not mean these words ironically.","2986":"Moreover, these critics assert, almost three weeks after the slaying of an American diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the government appears to be seeking to reassure the United States that it is serious about crushing any hint of radical Islam. The police say Mr. Foley's death has no connection to the unrest in Maan, but the subject of their manhunt, Muhammad Ahmad al-Chalabi, who is also called Abu Sayyaf, reportedly staged a rally here in support of Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","2987":"Mr. Fadhli's confession traces a network of Qaeda activity between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Yemen -- a further suggestion that Osama bin Laden's terrorist network remains active across the Arabian Peninsula. Last month, a missile fired from a C.I.A. Predator drone near the noman's land that forms the sketchy Saudi-Yemeni border killed a senior Qaeda leader, Qaed Senyan al-Harthi, a suspect in the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden two years ago, which killed 17 sailors.","2988":"WASHINGTON\u2014 THE shadow of terror reappeared at the nation's door last week, on the very day that Congress was congratulating itself for agreeing in principle to create a Department of Homeland Security. Osama bin Laden was not dead, intelligence analysts said. His voice, it seemed, was on an audiotape praising recent terror attacks and vowing new ones.","2989":"Fourteen months after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, the American people deserve a more effective warning system about possible new assaults than the Chicken Little alerts the Bush administration is providing. Once again last week, Washington, in effect, warned that the sky was falling, and officials did a good imitation of Henny Penny as they analyzed the latest intelligence data about Osama bin Laden. This is no way to conduct the affairs of the most powerful, technologically advanced nation on the planet.","299":"In the embassy bombings trial, prosecutors have turned over thousands of pages of documents from their investigation of the attacks, and of a broader terrorism conspiracy that the government says was led by a Saudi exile, Osama bin Laden.","2990":"The government officials who confirmed the outlines of the program did so in an apparent effort to rebut critics in Congress and elsewhere who have complained recently that American intelligence agencies are failing in their war against terror. Senior Democratic senators have said the problems are demonstrated by the government's inability to find Osama bin Laden and to identify specific threats since the Sept. 11 attacks.","2991":"Yemen is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden and the scene of two previous attacks on Western interests -- on the American destroyer Cole in 2000 and on the French tanker Limburg last month.","2992":"The arrests come at a time when Britons are being warned to be increasingly vigilant because of intelligence indicating that Al Qaeda is focusing on a strike on their country. Britain was one of the American allies threatened by name in a tape recording thought to be made by Osama bin Laden that was broadcast last week by Al Jazeera, the Arabic satellite television network.","2993":"He suggested that a newly released six-page statement attributed to Al Qaeda and warning of new terrorist strikes in Washington and New York might well be genuine and that it was 'likely' that Osama bin Laden's voice was the one heard last week on an audiotape threatening new attacks.","2994":"Intelligence officials have concluded that a tape that was broadcast on an Arab television station last week is genuine and that the voice is that of Osama bin Laden.","2995":"United States intelligence officials have concluded that the voice on a recently recorded audiotape broadcast on an Arab television channel last week is that of Osama bin Laden. The conclusion appears to end months of debate within the government. A22","2996":"Fox has many good news reporters, some of them lured away from CNN, but its news division is often held to a looser standard than that at other news organizations. The Fox News decision to send Geraldo Rivera to Afghanistan last year to track down Osama bin Laden was a national joke, but the press criticism was not nearly as sanctimonious as that directed at MSNBC for sending the inexperienced, if photogenic, Ashleigh Banfield to the same war zone.","2997":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 18\u2014 United States intelligence officials have concluded that a recently recorded audiotape that was broadcast on an Arab television network last week is genuine and contains the voice of Osama bin Laden, apparently ending months of debate in the government over whether the elusive terrorist leader is still alive.","2998":"'Osama bin Laden is still alive and plotting more attacks while we play bureaucratic shuffleboard.'","3":"In Jordan, 13 people were arrested last month in connection with a suspected plot by Islamic radicals linked to a Saudi-born militant, Osama bin Laden, to attack celebrations in Jerusalem and at the Vatican.","30":"Middle Eastern and American officials say they believe that a terrorist plot aimed at Western and Israeli tourists in Jordan in December was coordinated by a key lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile. A1","3000":"Mr. Hill is an important source for this book, which began as an article in The New Yorker. (It still has the diligent, data-gathering tone of a magazine story, much expanded.) And Mr. Hill, who was such a good shot that he could hit an aspirin with a BB gun, contributes a compelling personal history of his own. He was drawn to the Koran after his Vietnam days and took the name Abdullah al-Amin. He traveled to Afghanistan under that name in 1987, as an anti-Russian soldier of fortune. He urged Mr. Rescorla to join him in a plan to assassinate Osama bin Laden after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.","3001":"'Osama bin Laden is still alive and plotting more attacks while we play bureaucratic shuffleboard,' Mr. Byrd told the Senate. 'With a battle plan like the Bush administration is proposing, instead of crossing the Delaware River to capture the Hessian soldiers on Christmas Day, George Washington would have stayed on his side of the river and built a bureaucracy.' Mr. Byrd imagined Nathan Hale declaring, 'I have but one life to lose for my bureaucracy,' and Commodore Oliver Perry hoisting a flag on his ship with the rallying cry, 'Don't give up the bureaucracy!'","3002":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20\u2014 The State Department, responding to the latest Osama bin Laden audiotape, issued a global warning to Americans today that they might be targets of terrorist actions.","3003":"'My last resort is to raise two or three children,' she says, 'to become Sheik Osama bin Laden.'","3004":"LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20\u2014 Al Gore said today that the United States had failed to destroy Osama bin Laden and dismantle the network of Al Qaeda because President Bush spent the fall campaign 'beating the drums of war against Saddam Hussein' instead of prosecuting the war on terror.","3005":"Afghanistan requires substantial outside help to avoid returning to the lawlessness that opened the door to the Taliban a decade ago. The same conditions made it possible for Osama bin Laden to use the country as a headquarters and training ground for international terrorism.","3006":"An unspecified threat forced Mr. Bush to cancel his appearance today at the offices of Radio Free Europe. Terrorists, possibly connected to Iraq or Osama bin Laden, have been suspected for some time of casing it as a potential bomb target.","3007":"A Saudi in his mid-30's who reportedly worked at Osama bin Laden's side for more than a decade, Mr. Nashiri would be the highest-ranking Qaeda operative taken into custody since the arrest last March of Abu Zubaydah, who is described as the terror network's No. 3 official.","3008":"Bob Woodward's new book, 'Bush at War,' which chronicles the first 100 days of the administration's response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, reads like a novel: part bildungsroman (the young new president faced with a daunting challenge that will force him to come of age quickly); part spy thriller (C.I.A. operatives carrying suitcases of cash and vowing to bring back the head of Osama bin Laden); and part political melodrama (members of the war cabinet clashing over policy as they maneuver to win the president's heart and mind).","3009":"In recent years, Carlyle has been successful both at raising and making money. It has raised $14 billion in the last five years or so, and its annual rate of return has been 36 percent. Its 550 investors consist of institutions and wealthy individuals from around the world including, until shortly after September 2001, members of the bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia. The family -- which has publicly disavowed links with Osama bin Laden -- had been an investor since 1995.","301":"The judge's ruling came as the jury completed its fifth full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict in the trial. Four defendants are charged in a terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and included the embassy attacks.","3010":"The American Embassy issued a statement confirming the killing but providing no other details. The shooting comes just a day after the State Department issued a warning to Americans around the world to be vigilant about possible attacks. That warning, in turn, followed a statement by Osama bin Laden that said Americans would know no peace until the Palestinians gained security in the occupied territories and United States forces withdrew from Saudi Arabia.","3011":"In remarks made at Mr. Bush's side in the majestic setting of Catherine Palace outside St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin also suggested that the disappearance of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, was a major piece of unfinished business as the Bush administration focused its attention on a possible war in Iraq.","3012":"But none of it addresses the reality of post-election-November 2002, when each day brings news that Osama bin Laden and his minions are alive and hard at work, that the F.B.I.'s counterterrorism efforts remain slack and that the war on Saddam Hussein has started 'in everything but name,' as ABC News put it on Wednesday night. At a time like this, in the words of Heather Hurlburt of The Washington Monthly, 'a party that comes across as unserious about national security is permanently vulnerable, no matter how compelling its vision of domestic policy.'","3013":"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia raised questions about the reliability of two American allies in the campaign against terrorism, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He also suggested that the disappearance of Osama bin Laden is a major piece of unfinished business. A1","3014":"They would not say what information had been found so far, although they continued to express optimism that Mr. Nashiri would eventually disclose vital information about Al Qaeda's plans and the whereabouts of the rest of its leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","3015":"After months of debate among counterterrorism experts about whether he had died in the war in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden has sudden resurfaced. American intelligence officials concluded last week that a recently recorded audiotape that was broadcast on an Arab television network is genuine and contains the voice of the terrorist leader. On the tape, the voice said to be that of Osama bin Laden refers to several recent terrorist attacks, offering proof that he is alive, or at least was alive in recent weeks. James Risen","3016":"Anger over what many Muslims consider a blasphemous foreign military presence has left 24 Americans dead in two bombings and motivated Osama bin Laden, once a respected Saudi citizen, to wage his 'holy war' against the United States.","3017":"American and South Korean officials, when speaking anonymously, say the reason is obvious: the Bush administration has determined that Pakistan's cooperation in the search for Al Qaeda is so critical -- especially with new evidence suggesting that Osama bin Laden is still alive, perhaps on Pakistani soil.","3018":"Now this has nothing to do with homeland security. Nothing. This is not a provision that will in any way protect us from the ferocious evil of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. So why is it there? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the major drug companies have become a gigantic collective cash machine for politicians, and that the vast majority of that cash goes to Republicans.","3019":"Saudi militancy is mainly financial and expressed through proxies. The Saudis held a telethon to support Palestinian militants. They spend millions of dollars to support organizations that spread hatred of the United States and Israel. Yet they have not once rioted in significant numbers for the Palestinians or against the royal family's American protectors. This is as true for the fundamentalist heartland in the Najd region as it is for the more cosmopolitan Hijaz. Remember, Osama bin Laden stands out among both rich and poor because he is a Saudi who actually did something himself.","302":"The judge said he would consider the request. The jury sent Judge Sand two additional notes -- of a more serious nature -- asking to review exhibits and for the judge to clarify one of his instructions. It was the sixth full day the jury has been weighing the fate of four men charged with joining a terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania.","3020":"Meantime, the Grucci camp attacked him. Based on a discredited article in a 1994 student newspaper, it accused him of taking part in a cover-up of campus rapes while provost, and it used his opposition to the death penalty to imply he opposed the execution of Osama bin Laden.","3021":"Saudi Arabia has a lot to answer for in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, including the facts that 15 of the hijackers were Saudi citizens and that some of the financing for Osama bin Laden's network originated in the kingdom. Even so, it's hard to imagine that the wife of the Saudi ambassador to the United States knowingly funneled money to two of the hijackers, a charge that is now ricocheting around Washington.","3022":"Mr. Herbert writes: 'This is not a provision that will in any way protect us from the ferocious evil of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. So why is it there?'","3023":"Today, Mr. Fleischer also suggested publicly that Osama bin Laden and his associates might have chosen some of the 15 Saudi hijackers to 'drive a wedge' between the United States and Saudi Arabia. That theory has been put forth by American officials before, but rarely in public.","3024":"A Pakistani surgeon who once treated Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan said he was interrogated intensively by American intelligence agents, only to be released without charge and with an apology. A20","3025":"Mr. Moussaoui acknowledges that he is a member of Al Qaeda and loyal to Osama bin Laden, but he says he did not take part in the Sept. 11 attacks.","3026":"LAHORE, Pakistan, Nov. 26\u2014 A Pakistani surgeon who once treated Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan said he was interrogated intensively by American intelligence agents about his connections to Al Qaeda during a monthlong detention, only to be released without charge and with an apology.","3027":"Mr. Sharon directed Israel's spy agency, the Mossad, to track down those behind the attacks in Mombasa. If Al Qaeda was responsible, it would be the first time the group was known to have struck at Israelis since the current American antiterrorism effort began, although its leader, Osama bin Laden, has often inveighed against Israel.","3028":"When Israel argued that Yasir Arafat was protecting Palestinian terrorists in the same way that the Taliban protected Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the Bush administration objected and blocked Mr. Arafat's expulsion from the Palestinian territories.","3029":"WASHINGTON\u2014 It was only two months after I started learning Arabic at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., the military's primary language training center, that a group of Arabic-speaking terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. For many of my classmates, the attack was enough of a motivation to learn. For others, it was the taped interview with Osama bin Laden that strengthened our resolve. Either way, the events of Sept. 11 caused all of us to work even harder at mastering Arabic.","303":"Afghanistan is now under United Nations sanctions, imposed at the insistence of the United States because the Islamic movement will not turn over Osama bin Laden for trial in connection with attacks on two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.","3031":"Early indications, American officials said, pointed to either Osama bin Laden's network or possibly Al Ittihad al Islamiya, a Somali terrorist group believed to have links to Al Qaeda. 'There's a limited number of possibilities,' one official said.","3033":"The police throughout Southeast Asia have been on edge for weeks for fear of another Bali-style attack, perhaps aimed at an international school or a church. Authorities in the region say they are convinced that the leaders of the loosely affiliated network that Osama bin Laden put in place in the last decade remain at large today and ready to reactivate sleeper cells.","3034":"WASHINGTON\u2014 WHY does the head of Osama bin Laden seem to be one of those things that money can't buy?","3035":"The Bush administration has declared Abu Sayyaf a terrorist organization. A decade ago, when the group was founded with a goal to create an Islamic state, Osama bin Laden sent a brother-in-law to coordinate with the group. He provided money and sought to arrange a merger between Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a much larger and more powerful group in the Philippines.","3036":"The fact that the latest pronouncement by Osama bin Laden specifically threatens Canada is yet another reminder that our two countries are in this battle together. While the challenge may be difficult and enduring, together we will prevail.","3038":"As investigators struggled to determine who was behind the attacks on Israeli targets in Kenya on Thursday, they re-examined evidence that East Africa has served as both a useful base and a target for Osama bin Laden's terrorist network for nearly a decade. But while Al Qaeda remained a strong suspect, the Kenyan police reported few leads in the case. 1","3039":"MOMBASA, Kenya, Nov. 30\u2014 As investigators struggled to determine who was behind the attacks on Israeli targets here on Thursday, they are re-examining evidence that East Africa has served as both a useful base and a target for Osama bin Laden's terror network for nearly a decade.","304":"The issue arose as the jury in the bombings trial was sent home after a half day of deliberations after one juror complained of severe dental pain and was unable to continue. The jurors are now in their second week of deliberations, in which Mr. Al-'Owhali, Mr. Mohamed and two other defendants are charged in a broad terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and included the embassy bombings on Aug. 7, 1998.","3040":"The Kenyan police have set up a special telephone hot line and e-mail address to receive information from the public, but as of late today not a single tip had arrived. Al Qaeda, the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, has been widely mentioned as a likely organization behind the attack, but investigators here and in Washington said they lacked enough information to establish a definitive link.","3041":"The discovery of the closely sequenced serial numbers could provide the first concrete evidence that the most recent attack was carried out by Al Qaeda, the terror network led by Osama bin Laden.","3042":"The pitch was made five weeks after an F.B.I. investigation led to the arrests of six men in nearby Lackawanna on federal charges of providing material support for terrorism by attending a Qaeda training camp visited by Osama bin Laden.","3043":"To put it another way, what's going on in Iran today is precisely the war of ideas within Islam that is the most important war of all. We can kill Osama bin Laden and all his acolytes, but others will spring up in their place. The only ones who can delegitimize and root out these forces in any sustained way are Muslim societies themselves. And that will happen only when more Muslim societies undergo, from within, their own struggle for democracy and religious reform. Only the disenchanted citizens of the Soviet bloc could kill Marx; only Muslims fed up that their faith is being dominated by anti-modernists can kill bin Ladenism and its offshoots.","3044":"As his audience sat quietly throughout the address at New York University, he offered statistic after statistic intended to show the successes of his administration on everything from balancing the budget to improving health care for children, saying at one point that many of those accomplishments had gone unreported. His attacks on Mr. Bush's terrorism policy came after a year in which Republicans accused Mr. Clinton of failing to hunt down Osama bin Laden or dismantle Al Qaeda when he was in office.","3045":"Mr. Jubeir, a polished diplomat who was in turn defensive and combative at the news conference, also argued that Osama bin Laden had purposely deployed a large number of Saudis during the Sept. 11 attacks -- 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens -- to 'drive a wedge' between Washington and Riyadh.","3046":"The statement was not the first attributed to Mullah Omar to surface, though such statements are rarer than those attributed to Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda.","3047":"Osama bin Laden first declared war on the United States in February 1993, more than eight and a half years before the second World Trade Center disaster. Is it any wonder that Mr. Clinton wants to focus on the first eight months of President Bush's term instead of his eight-year failure to protect America from Al Qaeda?","3048":"Mr. Qadi once headed a Saudi-based charity called the Muwafaq Foundation, which federal authorities consider a front for Osama bin Laden's terror network. The government suspects that Mr. Qadi and other well-connected Saudis have transferred millions of dollars to Mr. bin Laden through trusts and charities like Muwafaq. Mr. Qadi denies having engaged in any such activity.","3049":"Whassup with that? It couldn't be that Americans have noticed that his government's official religion, the extremist Wahhabi sect of Islam, is the hate-filled creed that nurtured Osama bin Laden in the first place, or that Saudi Arabia has been Al Qaeda's 'most important source of funds,' as a task force of the Council on Foreign Relations reported in October. Or that the Saudi minister of the interior, Prince Nayef, maintained as recently as last week that the 15 Saudi hijackers of 9/11 were dupes in a Zionist plot.","305":"Prosecutors in both countries believe Mr. Ressam has information on targets and on a terrorist organization led by Osama bin Laden.","3050":"So the battle for the soul of Pakistan, a country whose identity has vacillated h between being a more secular and a more Islamic state, remains in play, even as the American interest in events here has grown. Pakistan is the only Muslim country known to have a nuclear bomb. And American intelligence officials have concluded that Osama bin Laden remains alive -- perhaps somewhere in Pakistan.","3051":"Brian Lukow and Louis Baldonieri, the producers, claim the parents were delusional, unable to handle the overheated realm of the teen idol that their boys were entering. By the time Dream Street disbanded, they had become the love objects of thousands of 6- to 17-year-old girls, girls who wrote them notes on handmade 'I Love Dream Street' stationery, promising 'I cannot marry anyone unless they are in Dream Street.' Girls called their cellphones relentlessly, waited outside their houses with expensive birthday presents, launched themselves into hysterics when they saw them walking down the sidewalk in the flesh. The boys thrived on this adoration. The parents were sometimes spooked by it. 'Those girls were so resourceful at tracking the boys down,' one mother, Lisa Galasso, says. 'I think they could find Osama bin Laden.'","3052":"Recent recorded messages attributed to Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, that cite Europe as a target have prompted politicians to put the continent on alert. Recent arrests in Europe, particularly in France and the Netherlands, have underscored the extent of the problem. Testimony at trials of suspected Qaeda members in the Netherlands and Germany has suggested the global reach of Mr. bin Laden's terrorist organization.","3054":"Mr. Abu Ghaith, a former Muslim preacher and teacher, emerged as Al Qaeda's spokesman after the Sept. 11 attacks. A close associate of Osama bin Laden, he is among the leading Qaeda members being sought by the United States and has been in hiding since the American-led campaign in Afghanistan began last year.","3056":"While Saudi Arabia has long been dominated by a conservative form of Islam, called Wahhabism in the West, Mr. Rashodi, 43, is part of an ultraconservative Islamic revival whose most extreme elements sympathize with, if not support, the holy war against the United States declared by Osama bin Laden. While many Americans have been disturbed by the conservative nature of Saudi Arabia's state-sponsored Islam, the kingdom is resisting an even more fundamentalist drift among its people.","3057":"Ms. Boof's Web site appeared on the Internet a few months ago, presenting her as a mysterious but alluring figure, whose life provided a potent brew of international politics, diplomatic and sexual -- part Graham Greene, part Jacqueline Susann. Among other things, she claims she briefly was Osama bin Laden's mistress, in the late 1990's.","3058":"Either way, Eminem's new cachet has robbed popular culture of a scapegoat to be accused of corrupting the kids, an evil entertainment figure to spur debate on Capitol Hill. While some may wonder which pop star will apply next for this position, perhaps it has already been filled. In the last year priorities on Capitol Hill have changed to more pressing matters. With much more intimidating names like Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein to bandy about, politicians do not need (or want to be perceived as having the time to care about) Eminem anymore.","3059":"The best-known international figure in Jemaah Islamiyah, and its formal leader is Abu Bakar Bashir, a 64-year old Indonesian cleric. Under pressure from the United States, Mr. Bashir, an unabashed admirer of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, was arrested by the Indonesian authorities in October.","3060":"A recent audiotape believed to have been made by Osama bin Laden praised and seemed to take responsibility for a suicide attack two months ago in which a speedboat packed with explosives rammed and crippled a French tanker, the Limburg, off Yemen. Other leaders of Al Qaeda have vowed to cut the 'economic lifelines' of the world's industrialized societies.","3061":"'Neither the U.S. government as a whole nor the intelligence community had a comprehensive counterterrorist strategy for combating the threat posed by Osama bin Laden,' the report said. 'The intelligence community was neither well organized nor equipped, and did not adequately adapt, to meet the challenge posed by global terrorists focused on targets within the domestic United States.'","3062":"As for rationale, I've heard Americans voice all the same theories about President Bush's motivation expressed by supposedly anti-American Europeans: that he's doing it to distract attention from economic problems at home. (Senator John Kerry recently raised this charge.) That the reason is oil. That he's completing unfinished business from the first Bush administration's Persian Gulf war. That it's a grudge match to topple the man who tried to kill Mr. Bush's father. That he's going after Saddam Hussein because he can't find Osama bin Laden. That it's about winning the next presidential election.","3063":"Since the attack in Bali, Australians have grown far more wary of sending the Australian military far overseas. Opinion polls show that Australians are also beginning to question the wisdom of unseating Saddam Hussein, in part because they now see themselves as targets for Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden has mentioned Australia as a nation hostile to the interests of Islam.","3064":"The movement's opposition to war, especially with Iraq, has taken center stage, becoming both a magnet and an umbrella for its deepened ranks. There were also Palestinian kaffiyeh scarves around marchers' necks and Osama bin Laden images brandished on some of their red flags.","3065":"Jordan said it had arrested two suspected Al Qaeda members in the killing of an American diplomat, and that both had ties to a fugitive linked to Osama bin Laden. Page 36.","3066":"The Bush administration has prepared a list of terrorist leaders the C.I.A. is authorized to kill, if capture is impractical and civilian casualties can be minimized. The list includes Osama bin Laden and other principal figures from Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups, senior military and intelligence officials said. 1","3067":"It would be a mistake, Fukuyama and Samin assert, to view this as a revival of traditional Islam. Radical Islam is a real departure -- a reformist movement that challenges almost every aspect of traditional authority in Islamic societies, from social services to jurisprudence to the exclusion of women from public life. Osama bin Laden, in issuing his 1998 fatwa against the United States, defied 'the fundamental sources of authority and legitimacy in the Islamic world,' the authors write. It was 'a bit like Hitler issuing a papal encyclical, or Lenin a decree in the name of the Russian Orthodox Church.'","3068":"We are at war. The only question is how to hit the bad guys to prevent them from hitting us again. I don't know if war on Iraq will stop Osama bin Laden, but a nuclear-armed Iraq is worth preventing.","3069":"The previously undisclosed C.I.A. list includes key Qaeda leaders like Osama bin Laden and his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, as well as other principal figures from Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups, the officials said. The names of about two dozen terrorist leaders have recently been on the lethal-force list, officials said. 'It's the worst of the worst,' an official said.","307":"Several said they did not believe it was much of a trial without the man reputed to be the mastermind, Osama bin Laden, in the dock. Others in this increasingly poor country said that Kenyans needed money for their wounds, and that justice in a foreign land was a distant second in their interests.","3070":"The Palestinian leader has sought to distance himself from Al Qaeda, warning Osama bin Laden to stop justifying attacks in the name of Palestinians. PAGE A13","3071":"The man with the camera was on a mission on that day two years ago. He had met with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and he had been assigned to blow up the Israeli Embassy in Canberra and the Israeli Consulate in Sydney.","3072":"Yasir Arafat sought to distance himself unequivocally from the Al Qaeda terror network in a published interview, warning Osama bin Laden to stop justifying attacks in the name of Palestinians. A13","3073":"JERUSALEM, Dec. 15\u2014 Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, sought to distance himself unequivocally from Al Qaeda in an interview published today, warning Osama bin Laden to stop justifying attacks in the name of Palestinians.","3074":"'When we were writing this bill we were thinking about Osama bin Laden and someone flying a plane into the Pentagon,' said David B. Albo, the member of the Virginia House of Delegates who sponsored the anti-terror bill. 'To be honest with you, when we passed this law I never thought it would be used.'","3075":"The assessment, by the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service, was contained in court documents released in connection with the detention of an Algerian immigrant suspected of ties to senior Qaeda members, including Abu Zubaydah, a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the group's leader. Mr. Zubaydah is being held at an undisclosed location by American authorities.","3076":"'The stability and order that devolve from American preponderance will gradually be replaced by renewed competition for primacy,' he writes. 'The unstoppable locomotive of globalization will run off its tracks as soon as Washington is no longer at the controls. Pax Americana is poised to give way to a much more unpredictable and dangerous global environment. And the chief threat will come not from the likes of Osama bin Laden, but from the return of traditional geopolitical rivalry.'","3077":"French investigators say the so-called Frankfurt group may have ultimately answered to Amar Makhlulif, also known as Abu Doha. British investigators have identified Mr. Makhlulif as an associate of Osama bin Laden who recruited fighters for camps in Afghanistan and led a plot to strike the Los Angeles airport that included Ahmed Ressam, another Algerian.","3078":"One of the poorest nations in the Middle East, Yemen and its 19 million people are spread across an arid landscape where intertribal rivalry and conflict abound. Yemen is also the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in the mountainous Hadhramaut region, which straddles the caravan route that connected the Queen of Sheba's realm to King Solomon's court.","3079":"Google (www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html) and Yahoo (yir.yahoo.com) both look at the year's top stories based on search queries: Iraq, the World Cup, the Maryland sniper, Las Ketchup (a Spanish singing group). Google's list of queries that most sharply declined is perhaps more telling. Anything having to do with Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and Nostradamus dropped off the charts.","308":"The other two defendants, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 40, were convicted of participating in the conspiracy, which prosecutors said was directed by Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi financier, who has eluded American capture. They face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.","3081":"Dismissed evidence included stolen passports, manuals on explosives and land mines, and a videotape of Osama bin Laden appealing for a holy war against the United States.","3083":"He has been king since 1982 and remains head of state and prime minister, but since the mid-90's, he has been incapacitated by a series of strokes. In 1990, following Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, King Fahd chose the path of action suggested by Dick Cheney, then secretary of defense, and allowed the U.S. military to secure Saudi Arabia. Fahd's move, reportedly made without traditional consensus within the royal family, confirmed the foundation of the kingdom's relationship with the U.S.: security in exchange for oil. It also earned the contempt of Osama bin Laden, who insisted that his mujahedeen warriors could have protected the kingdom.","3084":"Mr. Nashiri's interrogation thus far has yet to yield information about Qaeda plans or clues to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, officials said.","3085":"Iraq for some time has been seeking to put an Islamic tint on its differences with Washington, so as to rally Muslim support to its side. Religion is a strictly state-controlled affair here, with Saddam Hussein's government denying any links to terrorist figures like Osama bin Laden, despite attempts by Washington to make the connection.","3086":"The failure to monitor Mr. Ganczarski occurred after he had confessed to the police that he had been in Afghanistan five times and that he had met on occasions with Mr. Mohammed and once with Osama bin Laden.","3087":"How can a force that transforms convicted murderers into placid samaritans, and that has given the world Handel's 'Messiah,' the mosaics of Ravenna and Borobudur Temple also have spawned the Salem witch hunts, Osama bin Laden and columnists who snarl that America should invade Muslim countries, 'kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity'? What sort of Jekyll-and-Hydra-headed beast is this thing called religious faith?","3088":"It's an oddity that will be avoided by millions of people, this new 'Pinocchio.' Osama bin Laden could attend a showing in Times Square and be confident of remaining hidden.","3089":"In the last several months, the tribal areas have emerged as a growing source of frustration for American forces in Afghanistan and F.B.I. agents in Pakistan. Raids by bureau agents have failed to capture the small number of Arab members of Al Qaeda -- possibly even Osama bin Laden himself -- who are believed to be hiding in the tribal areas.","3090":"The new year opened with a chest-thumping sense of mission, unity and resolve. The war in Afghanistan seemed to be unfolding with only a rare wrinkle, and while Osama bin Laden remained a wily quarry, Americans still had confidence he would be caught. In his first State of the Union address, President Bush articulated a with-us-or-against-us posture that would inform American foreign policy for much of the year.","3091":"Osama bin Laden, the founder and leader of Al Qaeda, was dead for about five months this past year. In July, Dale Watson, then the F.B.I.'s head of counterterrorism, said publicly that he thought bin Laden had died, perhaps in the savage battle of Tora Bora in Afghanistan. No, said Pervez Musharraf, the president and generalissimo of Pakistan, bin Laden had died of kidney failure. Or perhaps it was something else. Certainly the nemesis of the Western world had neither been seen nor heard from since the previous December. And then, last month, he popped up again like the inextinguishable Professor Moriarty. In an audiotape that was first broadcast Nov. 12 and that has been declared authentic, bin Laden issued another in his string of apocalyptic threats. 'As you kill,' he admonished his adversaries in the West, 'you will be killed. As you bomb, you will be bombed.' It is we, not he, who will be killed.","3092":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Saudi Arabian diplomats have spent the last month on a public relations blitz, lashing out at Americans who raise questions about links between terrorist groups and the country's Islamic charities. Adel al-Jubeir, a key foreign-policy adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah, told a Washington press conference of a campaign 'bordering on hate' and warned that 'those who are most critical or hostile toward Saudi Arabia . . . are playing right into' the hands of Osama bin Laden.","3093":"9. Osama bin Laden will (a) be sold out by a trusted supporter for the huge reward; (b) remain at large and take credit on Al Jazeera for any terror attacks anywhere; (c) be captured and, under interrogation, burn his sleeper network.","3094":"In Washington, officials said it was too early to jump to conclusions about whether Mr. Kamil acted alone or was linked with Al Qaeda, whose leader, Osama bin Laden, has family origins in Yemen.","3095":"WASHINGTON\u2014 President Bush and his administration have declared a war against terrorism that may soon involve sending thousands of American troops into combat in Iraq. I voted against the Congressional resolution giving the president authority to carry out this war -- an engagement that would dwarf our military efforts to find Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.","3096":"The bombing produced an outcry in the Pakistani tribal areas, where Americans are viewed as conquering invaders and several dozen members of Al Qaeda, possibly including Osama bin Laden, are believed to be hiding.","3098":"Get your proposal in by 4 p.m. sharp on Jan. 29. And some advice to Osama bin Laden: Forget the dry cleaner. You'd better just burn your old laundry.","3099":"In the end, the four men were convicted of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 attacks, which left 224 dead, but the two men who faced the death penalty had their lives spared when the jury twice deadlocked on the question of execution. It was, then, an enormous if still incomplete victory for the government in its effort before Sept. 11, 2001, to try terrorists in civilian courts.","31":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 28\u2014 Middle Eastern and American officials say they believe that a key lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, coordinated a terrorist plot that was aimed at Western and Israeli tourists in Jordan in December.","310":"Four men were convicted yesterday of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in a terrorist plot to bomb the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The blasts killed 224 people, injured thousands and glaringly exposed the United States' vulnerability abroad.","3100":"Dubai's location in the Middle East would be enough to stress out some people. To the northwest is Iraq; to the south is Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden. Only 60 miles across the Strait of Hormuz is Iran. Just offshore in the Persian Gulf, American warships send fighter jets over Iraq every day; in a war, they would probably fire Tomahawk missiles as well.","3101":"Last January, a teenage pilot crashed a plane into a tower in Tampa, Fla., in what police there said was a gesture of support for the terror network of Osama bin Laden and the hijackers who brought down the World Trade Center.","3102":"'I don't want terror rained on other people to avenge my brother's death,' Ms. Lasar said the other evening in her East Village apartment. 'And I don't spend any time thinking about Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and what I want to do to those people. It's irrelevant at this point. What's relevant is not having other innocent people die because my brother died.'","3103":"Of course, Iran continues to play both sides: just across its border, in the free zone of Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran provides a unit of 600 pro-Saddam terrorists with ammunition and mines to harass the free Kurds. These terrorists are led by Musab Zarwaqi, known to be a top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden; inexplicably, they are not targeted by U.S. bombers.","3104":"Investigators say, so far, they see no direct link, though it would not be surprising if they found one. Yemen -- rugged, remote, a nation of tribes, guns and swooping daggers open to the outside world for less than a century -- is the place Osama bin Laden calls his ancestral home. Al Qaeda has carried out several attacks here. Its members have sought refuge here since the Sept. 11 attacks and have also been killed here, notably in November by missiles from an unmanned American aircraft.","3105":"Mr. Pataki spent much of his 55-minute speech talking about the need to be vigilant against terrorism and to pass new laws to make it easier to ferret out terrorists. He applauded American soldiers abroad and allowed himself a moment of patriotic gloating over a piece of marble, reputed to be from a palace where Osama bin Laden once lived, that New York reservists brought back from Afghanistan.","3106":"In a case in Boston, customs agents are investigating possible financial links between a software company and a Saudi millionaire with ties to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","3107":"The plea agreement states that after the men had returned from Afghanistan, Mr. Alwan told Mr. Galab to deny to federal agents that the trip took place. It also states that Mr. Alwan told Mr. Galab he met with Osama bin Laden, who asked whether anyone in America was willing to die for the cause.","3108":"Also, in an audiotape believed to have been made by Osama bin Laden that was broadcast after the Bali attack, the speaker named Australia as an enemy of Islam. It was the second time Al Qaeda singled out Australia as a devoted ally of the United States that deserved punishment.","3109":"In Washington, American officials described Sheik Mouyad as a significant Qaeda figure and a fund-raiser for Osama bin Laden but not a top-level leader, and they said the United States provided information that helped lead to his capture.","311":"A federal jury convicted four men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in a terror plot that resulted in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, claiming 224 lives. Two defendants found guilty of murder, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, could receive the death penalty. Mr. bin Laden is a fugitive. A1","3110":"Mr. Miller's Rolodex is extensive. He had a face-to-face interview with Osama bin Laden in 1998.","3111":"Three leftover enemies from the war in Afghanistan remain at large and, American and Afghan officials say, still pose a potentially lethal threat to peace in the region even as the United States turns its attention toward Iraq. The list includes Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A11","3112":"The three -- Osama bin Laden; Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader; and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who opposes the government of President Hamid Karzai and has called for a holy war against the United States -- have frustrated more than a year of American efforts to find them.","3113":"Major Schmidt, with Major Umbach's coaching, dropped a single laser-guided 500-pound bomb. But the Canadians were actually conducting routine live-fire exercises at Tarnak Farms, a largely destroyed complex once owned by Osama bin Laden. The Canadians were training with antitank guns and machine guns, shooting at a burnt-out tank -- but the American pilots had not been briefed about the exercises.","3114":"Each was convicted of participating in a worldwide conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden, which prosecutors said included the bombings of the American Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998, which killed 224 people and wounded thousands.","3115":"A picture on Wednesday with an article about the hunt for three major figures from the war in Afghanistan was published in error. The picture -- between those of Osama bin Laden and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a former Afghan prime minister -- showed Mullah Malang, a former Afghan rebel commander, not the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar.","3116":"'They asked me about Afghanistan, the people there, my beliefs, contacts in Jordan and my party membership,' he said, according to the transcript. 'By party membership that meant whether I was a follower of Hezbollah, Hamas, Jihad or Osama bin Laden.'","3117":"The United Nations Security Council unanimously voted in favor of a resolution strengthening the enforcement of penalties -- including the freezing of funds, an arms embargo and travel prohibitions -- against Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and their associates. It also called on governments to submit updated reports on their efforts.","3119":"All scoffed at the notion that their detention produced valuable intelligence. They described undergoing only cursory interviews by F.B.I. or I.N.S. agents: Do you like Osama bin Laden? Can you fly a plane? Do you pray five times a day?","312":"Before the embassy bombings trial, Osama bin Laden loomed large in the American psyche, a villain of unimaginable evil and sophisticated reach. It was an image fed by destruction done and by American law enforcement eager to drive home the reality of his threat. In some ways, though, it was an image created because so little was known about how he worked.","3120":"After the attacks, he wanted to normalize his legal status. In March, he answered an ad from a Florida lawyer who offered to sponsor immigrants for citizenship. A week later, F.B.I. and I.N.S. agents arrested him. The ad, he believes, was a ruse. He said F.B.I. agents had asked him if he knew Osama bin Laden, if he had been to Afghanistan or Kashmir and if he could fly a plane. They offered him citizenship in exchange for information.","3121":"Mr. Masri, who is wanted in Yemen on terrorism charges, supports Osama bin Laden, praises the Sept. 11 hijackers as martyrs, calls Prime Minister Tony Blair a 'legitimate target' for Muslim warriors and encourages unemployed young Muslims in London to join in what he calls the holy war against the West.","3122":"The bombing occurred in April at Tarnak Farms, a former base for Al Qaeda once owned by Osama bin Laden that had been converted early last year into a firing range for coalition troops. A squad of Canadian light infantrymen were conducting routine exercises with machine guns and an antitank grenade launcher when the two pilots, en route to an airborne refueling, mistook the muzzle flashes from the Canadians' weapons for hostile ground-to-air fire. Four Canadians were killed and eight wounded by the bomb.","3123":"One eulogist spoke for 43 minutes. Another ran to the piano for an impromptu performance. Yet another told a joke about Osama bin Laden.","3124":"One French official argued that the American military's failure to hunt down Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda's top command had led Mr. Bush to search for 'easier but less important prey.'","3125":"British authorities have not publicly linked the suspects to Al Qaeda, but one government official in London said there was evidence of significant links between the men and the terrorist network established by Osama bin Laden. That official said that at least one of the men in custody was trained at a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan.","3126":"Four Algerians now on trial in Germany for allegedly planning to attack a Christmas market in France are believed to be members of the Frankfurt cell led by Mr. Bensakhria, who is described as a representative in Europe of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda. But German authorities say the four on trial do not appear to have been involved in the Sept. 11 attacks.","3127":"'For decades, the jihad -- the holy war -- has been the agenda of the Islamic world against the Western value system. The Anglo-American and European employees of the global players, dispersed throughout the world are -- as Osama bin Laden proclaimed a long while ago -- military targets. Only a few need be liquidated in this manner; the survivors will run off like hares into their respective home countries, where they belong.'","3128":"An American civilian defense contractor, Michael Rene Pouliot, 46, was killed and his co-worker, David John Caraway, 37, seriously wounded when a Kuwaiti opened fire on their car near Camp Doha, the United States military headquarters. It was the third such attack since the American military buildup began last fall. Hours later, Saudi border guards arrested Sami Mohammed Al-Mutairi, 25, whom the police identified as a government worker and Osama bin Laden sympathizer. Patrick E. Tyler","3130":"WASHINGTON\u2014 In the days following the Sept. 11 attacks, Secretary of State Colin Powell could find 'no clear link' between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.","3131":"United Nations officials have reported that Taliban members have been trickling back in from Pakistan. One United Nations official said at a meeting of nongovernmental organizations over the weekend that Taliban fighters were gathering in Tora Bora, the mountainous area in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden was last heard of in December 2001.","3132":"Today's producers no longer feel compelled to draw a modesty curtain around current events. The plot of this season's '24,' a Fox series, pits a top C.I.A. agent played by Kiefer Sutherland against an Osama bin Laden-like madman bent on exploding a nuclear bomb in the United States. When she is not trying to uncover her own obscure and appalling family secrets, the sexy secret agent played by Jennifer Garner on the ABC show 'Alias' also battles the occasional terrorists.","3133":"A year ago, in his first State of the Union speech, Mr. Bush addressed a shaken nation that had recently been attacked and a public galvanized behind its still relatively new president. Support for his swift military campaign in Afghanistan to destroy the Taliban and hunt down Osama bin Laden was high.","3134":"Tonight, President Bush spoke about the threats we face from terrorists and dictators abroad. Many of the young Americans who fought in Afghanistan -- and who tonight are still defending our freedom -- were trained in Washington State. We are so grateful to them, to all the members of our armed services and their families, and we pray for their safe return. But the war against terror is not over. Al Qaeda still targets Americans. Osama bin Laden is still at large. As we rise to the many challenges around the globe, let us never lose sight of who attacked our people here at home.","3135":"'We are far stronger when we stand with other nations than when we stand alone,' said Mr. Locke, who, like other Democrats, also noted that while Mr. Bush was focused on Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, remained at large.","3136":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 28\u2014 For all the talk about Iraq before tonight's address, President Bush devoted the first half of his speech to problems at home. Before he uttered a word about Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden, he uncustomarily talked about the AIDS epidemic and the need to mentor the children of inmates. And he proclaimed that his No. 1 goal was providing jobs for all.","3137":"3. When the postwar books are written, a former Iraqi spymaster with knowledge of the suicide attacker Mohamed Atta's perhaps unwitting connection to Saddam will eagerly come forth to spill all he knows to save his neck or sell his memoirs. Suspected followers of Osama bin Laden like Musaab Zarqawi and Mullah Krekar, if alive, will further link Al Qaeda to Saddam's mukhabarat police.","3138":"LONDON, Jan. 30\u2014 British officials believe that Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, successfully built a crude radiological device known as a 'dirty bomb' in Afghanistan, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported today.","3139":"Mr. Reid was unrepentant and confrontational, telling Judge William G. Young of Federal District Court, 'I am at war with your country' and saying, 'I further admit my allegiance to Sheik Osama bin Laden, to Islam and to the religion of Allah.'","314":"Like many people wounded in the blast, Mr. Abiuda, 49, said the verdicts in New York on Tuesday against four of Osama bin Laden's followers were important but incomplete. First on his list was the arrest of Mr. bin Laden, the Islamic militant who prosecutors said led a global terrorism conspiracy that included the nearly simultaneous bombings of the American Embassies here and in Tanzania that killed 224 people.","3140":"Wrong. In fact the bases radicalized many young Saudis, and persuaded Osama bin Laden to turn his sights on the U.S. What seemed a shrewd move to improve our security ended up undermining our friends and strengthening our enemies.","3141":"All that is needed to get us into war is one clear reason for acting, one that would be generally persuasive. But efforts to link the Iraqis directly to Osama bin Laden have proved inconclusive. Assertions that Iraq threatens its neighbors have also failed to create much resolve; in its present debilitated condition -- thanks to United Nations sanctions -- Iraq's conventional forces threaten no one.","3142":"She does not support the ideology of Osama bin Laden, but she and her friend Dina Abdullah Marzook, a fellow college student who joined her for coffee, said they think Mr. bin Laden speaks more eloquently and with more charisma than any American leader.","3143":"The defendant, Mohamed Suleiman al Nalfi, was originally arrested in late 2000 in the broad terrorism conspiracy case that included the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa. Had he been convicted, he could have faced a life sentence. Instead, he pleaded guilty to a different conspiracy charge, and admitted in court that he had worked for Al Qaeda, the terrorist network run by Osama bin Laden, in his native Sudan in the early 1990's.","3144":"Before tackling the country's computer vulnerabilities, Mr. Clarke was in charge of the White House's counterterrorism office for President Bush and President Bill Clinton. He sometimes antagonized officials in federal agencies and even some White House colleagues by demanding more aggressive action against Islamic extremists like Osama bin Laden. Mr. Clarke, associates said, was an ardent proponent of military action not only against Mr. bin Laden, but also against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, which provided a home for him and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","3146":"Given the deep antipathy between fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden and secular rulers like Saddam Hussein, the lack of evidence linking them is not surprising. But even if American pressure brings these unlikely bedfellows together, Mr. Hussein is not going to give Al Qaeda weapons of mass destruction. He would have little to gain and everything to lose since he could never be sure that American surveillance would not detect the handoff. If it did, the United States response would be swift and devastating.","3147":"According to Mr. Okal's indictment, he met in March 1998 in Kabul with a top aide to Osama bin Laden, and was then sent to a Qaeda training camp in Jalalabad.","3148":"At the mosque, Mr. Masri has praised Osama bin Laden and has encouraged young Muslims in London to join a holy war against the West, calling Prime Minister Tony Blair a 'legitimate target.'","3149":"I've had a chance to travel all across the country since September, and I can say without hesitation there was not a single audience I spoke to where I felt there was a majority in favor of war in Iraq. The dominant mood is: 'Mr. President, we don't want to be against you in a war on terrorism. But do we really have to do this? My 401(k) is now a 201(k), heading for a 101(k). Osama bin Laden is still on the loose. The Europeans are uncovering new terrorist cells right and left. And I have walked through so many airport metal detectors in the last year that I now glow in the dark. I understand what the Afghan war was about and would have volunteered with a pitchfork -- but I just don't get this war.'","315":"The prosecutor's call for the death penalty came on the first day of a sentencing hearing for Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, one of four men convicted on Tuesday of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a terrorism plot against Americans, which included the embassy attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998.","3150":"Citing foreign intelligence reports, Mr. Powell asserted that Osama bin Laden met with senior Iraqi intelligence officials. He added that 'extremists' affiliated with Al Qaeda have taken up residence in Baghdad and set up a base of operations there. But a senior State Department officials stressed after the speech that the Bush administration was not asserting that Saddam Hussein was 'exercising operational control' of Al Qaeda.","3151":"Three months before Sept. 11, Mullah Krekar called Osama bin Laden the 'jewel in the crown of the Muslim nation' -- a phrase widely attributed to him in the European press. But tonight he denied meeting Mr. bin Laden or allowing his organization to become a safe house for Qaeda members on the run. He also scoffed at a satellite photo that Mr. Powell said showed a terrorist poison and explosives factory in northeastern Iraq. 'It looks like a village,' he said.","3153":"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell referred to the killing of the officer, Detective Constable Stephen Oake, in his speech on Wednesday before the United Nations Security Council in New York. He said the raid in which Mr. Oake was killed had helped unearth a cell of 'North African extremists' in Europe with links to a terror network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a collaborator of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","3154":"POWELL -- There is a 'potentially sinister nexus between Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' Mr. Powell said. He presented details of what he said was a ring of terror operatives based in Baghdad, commanded by Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, a follower of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Powell also said that high-level contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda went back to the mid-1990's and that Zarqawi's lieutenants were helping to run an explosives training camp in northeastern Iraq.","3155":"Mr. Moussaoui has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, but he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 plot.","3156":"Not my fault, says Mr. Bush. 'A recession and a war we did not choose have led to a return of deficits,' he declared. Really? Will the recession and war cost $570 billion per year, every year? Besides, Mr. Bush knew all about the recession and Osama bin Laden (remember him?) a year ago, when his projections showed a return to surpluses by 2005. Now they show deficits forever -- even though they don't include the costs of an Iraq war.","3157":"Court-appointed lawyers for Mr. Moussaoui have long cited his constitutional fair-trial rights in suggesting they would demand access to captured terrorist suspects and other witnesses who might be able to support his case. Mr. Moussaoui has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, but he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 plot.","3158":"Mr. Powell said the camp had been established by a network led by Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, an associate of Osama bin Laden who is accused of coordinating the killing of an American diplomat in Jordan last year.","3159":"IF one reads those who would blow us up, the reason they give is revenge for humiliation. 'What America is tasting now is only a copy of what we have tasted,' Osama bin Laden said shortly after 9/11. 'Our Islamic nation has been tasting the same for more than 80 years of humiliation and disgrace.' In other words, a certain kind of memory propels Muslim fundamentalists.","3160":"What, exactly, has George W. Bush accomplished to even begin to merit comparison? He has pledged to bring Osama bin Laden to justice and to eliminate the threat from Al Qaeda -- so far without success. Under Bush's watch the economy has weakened. And his policy toward Iraq threatens increased global conflict at the philosophical, political and physical levels.","3161":"A mother fighting for her son's life: an inherently sympathetic figure, iconic even. Given France's opposition to the death penalty and suspicion of the Bush administration, el-Wafi might have found strong public support for her legal struggle no matter how solid the case against Moussaoui was. As it is, however, even in the United States legal critics have pointed out that the government has provided little hard evidence linking Moussaoui to the attacks, or proving that he even knew the specifics of the hijackers' plan. What's more, Judge Leonie Brinkema granted Moussaoui's request to defend himself, despite his disjointed ravings and paranoid behavior. In addition to announcing his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, his membership in Al Qaeda and his wish for the destruction of the United States and Israel, he has told the court that his lawyers were trying to kill him. His court filings refer not to the World Trade Center but to the 'World Top Circus.' The demands he has made include the return of Spain to the Moors.","3162":"The presence of foreign -- especially American -- forces since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 has been a contentious issue in Saudi Arabia and has spurred the terrorism of Osama bin Laden, the now disowned scion of one of the kingdom's wealthiest families, and his followers in Al Qaeda.","3163":"In a presentation last week to the United Nations Security Council, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell portrayed the group as an affiliate of Al Qaeda that harbors fighters from Afghanistan and manufactures toxins for terrorist use. Mr. Powell said the group ran a terrorist training center and poison factory supported by Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, who he said was an Osama bin Laden lieutenant. The United States contends that Mr. Zarqawi has operated a terrorist network from Baghdad since the Taliban were ousted from Afghanistan.","3164":"Mr. Zarqawi's group is known as Al Tawhid, which Mr. Powell described as an 'affiliate' of Al Qaeda whose terrorist goals seemed indistinguishable from those of Osama bin Laden's network.","3165":"Mr. Abdullah has provided a detailed description of life in a camp occupied by Qaeda leaders including Osama bin Laden. He told investigators that Mr. bin al-Shibh, referred to by his nom de guerre, Obeida, was a prominent figure there.","3166":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 10\u2014 The director of one of America's largest Muslim charities, a man depicted by federal prosecutors as a crucial financier for Osama bin Laden, struck an eleventh-hour plea agreement today without admitting any ties to Al Qaeda or terrorism.","3167":"The director of one of American's largest Muslim charities, a man depicted by federal prosecutors as a key financier for Osama bin Laden, struck an eleventh-hour plea agreement without admitting any ties to","3168":"Shares fell across the board yesterday after an audio tape reported to be from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, ignited investor jitters that war with Iraq was drawing near.","3169":"Mr. Grassley's meeting with Mr. Bush was part of a White House offensive to show the president as hard at work on the economy and domestic matters at a time of overwhelming international concerns. The president sandwiched the meeting with Mr. Grassley, and one later in the day with House members on welfare legislation, in between phone calls about Iraq and terrorism. At the same time, television sets at the White House were tuned to what was said to be the latest message from Osama bin Laden.","3170":"Mr. Powell seized on a new audiotape believed to be of Osama bin Laden, urging Muslims to help Baghdad defend itself against an American attack, as evidence that the Qaeda leader was 'in partnership with Iraq.'","3171":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Osama bin Laden came to the rescue of George W. Bush yesterday.","3172":"EURO STEADY. The dollar was flat against the euro after some traders speculated a message from Osama bin Laden would make an attack on Iraq more likely. In New York, the dollar was 1.0738 to the euro, from 1.0745.","3173":"When President Bush called on Americans to go shopping to help the country recover from the trauma of the 9/11 attacks, it was the consummate evocation of consumption as patriotism. In our country's earlier days a president might have called for parades to stoke up patriotic fervor after such an attack, or for the sacrifice of blood and treasure. But President Bush conflated patriotism with shopping. Maxing out your credit cards at the mall wasn't self-indulgence, it was a way to get back at Osama bin Laden.","3174":"KUWAIT CITY, Feb. 11\u2014 A recorded message apparently made by Osama bin Laden called on Muslims today to repulse any United States attempt to invade Iraq, urging them to apply the lessons learned by Al Qaeda, his terror network.","3175":"The nation has been so focused on the Bush administration's plans for war with Iraq that the war against Al Qaeda seemed to slip into the background. But the fear of terrorism was front and center again yesterday, as the F.B.I. director warned Congress about Qaeda cells inside this country and a new audio tape surfaced purporting to be a recording of Osama bin Laden urging Iraqis to undertake suicide missions against the United States. All this occurred at a time when the national terrorism alert level was at the nervous-making Code Orange level and the government was issuing guidelines on how to gird the family home against chemical or biological warfare.","3176":"Senior Bush administration officials intensified their effort to link Al Qaeda to Iraq, led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who seized on a new audio tape believed to be of Osama bin Laden as evidence that the terrorist leader was 'in partnership with Iraq.' A1","3177":"The latest Osama bin Laden tape is not evidence that Al Qaeda is 'in partnership with Iraq,' as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell asserts (front page, Feb. 12).","3179":"Osama bin Laden and most of his lieutenants remain at large. Only one person accused of connection to the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks has been captured.","318":"Four men were convicted in New York on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 and wounded thousands. Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, could face the death penalty; Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 40, face life terms. The trial, which began in February, offered a new vision of Mr. bin Laden's group, no less menacing than the old, but more loose-knit, at times torn by dissension and betrayal. Some members defected over salary disputes. Benjamin Weiser","3180":"The director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, warned that the latest taped message attributed to Osama bin Laden was an 'exhortation to his followers,' like statements made by the terrorist leader last year that were quickly followed by deadly attacks. A1","3181":"It is amazing that President Bush did not mention Osama bin Laden by name once in his State of the Union address, and yet Osama bin Laden is back on the front pages again.","3182":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 12\u2014 The country's intelligence chief warned today that the latest taped message attributed to Osama bin Laden was an 'exhortation to his followers,' like statements made by the terrorist leader last year that were quickly followed by deadly attacks overseas.","3183":"Nothing would make it easier for President Bush to overcome the nation's doubts about going to war with Iraq than proof that Saddam Hussein is in league with Osama bin Laden. Talk about an axis of evil! In truth, however, there is little hard evidence of such a connection, and the administration should stop peddling that line to the American people. There are legitimate reasons to confront Iraq. Imagining a full-blown Baghdad chapter of Al Qaeda is not one of them.","3184":"In the larger picture, the Oval Office's fear campaign makes possible less personal but no less frightening irrationalities: acquiescence to curtailment of civil rights at home (the U.S.A. Patriot Act and coming extensions) and misguided bloodthirstiness abroad (Iraqi lives as sacrificial surrogates for Osama bin Laden).","3185":"Mr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei cannot be left to play games of hide-and-seek. This is not like Washington's unproved assertions about an alliance between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. There is ample evidence that Iraq has produced highly toxic VX nerve gas and anthrax and has the capacity to produce a lot more. It has concealed these materials, lied about them, and more recently failed to account for them to the current inspectors. The Security Council doesn't need to sit through more months of inconclusive reports. It needs full and immediate Iraqi disarmament. It needs to say so, backed by the threat of military force.","3186":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 14\u2014 Following are excerpts from an audiotaped message broadcast in Arabic this week by Al Jazeera television and attributed to Osama bin Laden, as recorded and translated by Reuters.","3187":"The government's alarm grew earlier in the week when the Arabic-language satellite television network al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape that appeared to be from Osama bin Laden, in which the speaker expressed solidarity with Iraq in the face of a threatened American invasion and called for suicide attacks against American targets.","3188":"Threatening attacks against the United States and urging Muslims to defend Iraq against an American-led invasion, the latest tape attributed to Osama bin Laden and broadcast by Al Jazeera television jangled the frayed nerves of Americans already fearful that a terror attack might be imminent. Senior Bush administration officials like Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the tape buttressed the case for military action against Saddam Hussein, saying it showed Mr. bin Laden was 'in partnership with Iraq.' David Johnston","3189":"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq\u2014 THE audiotape thought to carry the words of Osama bin Laden traveled the airwaves last week, imploring Muslims to wage war against supporters of the United States. The faint voice almost certainly reached a compound in Sarget, a village in northern Iraq that is out of the control of both Saddam Hussein and the pro-American Kurds who govern the region.","319":"Osama bin Laden, the most despised of modern terrorists, is being safely sheltered by the Taliban. From this safe haven he is training terrorists from around the world to destroy those governments that do not run their administrations as prescribed by the Taliban's interpretation of Islam.","3190":"Many people here clustered into homes with generator-powered televisions to watch Mr. Powell's presentation, and said they were astonished to see their village named as the nexus between Osama bin Laden and Mr. Hussein.","3191":"Both conservatives and reformists in Iran's complicated political structure have branded Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network as terrorist.","3192":"Mr. Abdullah's odyssey from life in Jordan to membership in Al Qaeda is similar to those of hundreds of disillusioned young Arab men -- many of whom sought asylum in Europe only to end up mired in poverty and religious extremism. But his journey differed from most in one important way: as he described it to officials, he came into contact with Osama bin Laden and earned the trust and confidence of other crucial Qaeda leaders.","3193":"I am also very troubled by the way Bush officials have tried to justify this war on the grounds that Saddam is allied with Osama bin Laden or will be soon. There is simply no proof of that, and every time I hear them repeat it I think of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. You don't take the country to war on the wings of a lie.","3194":"Moreover, no one -- not even America's intelligence agencies -- can predict what will emerge when the lid is lifted on Iraq. No one can foresee the severity of the killing, the danger of the doomsday weapons, or the validity of the fear that in a battered and crumbling Iraq 5 or 10 Osama bin Ladens will emerge to take Saddam Hussein's place.","3195":"The staff monitors children closely to see whether they need counseling or extra time for homework or another chance at a test they may have done poorly on because they are upset about an absent parent. They are familiar with what Judith Norris, director of student services for the Bragg schools, calls SPMS, sad, proud, mad and scared, the predictable emotions of children whose parents have been deployed. Children are encouraged to express their feelings. At Devers Elementary School, second graders whose parents have been sent out recently wrote letters to President Sadaam Hussein of Iraq and Osama bin Laden.","3196":"Mr. Motassadeq acknowledged in testimony during the four-month trial that he had attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan sponsored by Osama bin Laden.","3197":"'I called as many people as I can and I posted this on a Web site -- your car dealership should never remain in business,' said a man who thought the ad was about Osama bin Laden.","3198":"But they were less sure than most Americans about Iraq's links with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. While 86 percent of the respondents to the Gallup poll said they thought it was likely or certain that such ties exist, only 66 percent of New Yorkers agreed. Twenty percent of them had no opinion, which was true of only 2 percent of the respondents to the national poll.","3199":"Even the cellphones of these men mapped their varying politics. The liquid crystal display on the phone of a bearded representative of Hamas showed a picture of Osama bin Laden beside an image of the Twin Towers. The representative of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a group with Marxist roots, displayed a picture of Ch\u00e9 Guevara and a single English word: freedom. A leader of the Aksa Martyrs Brigade, a militant group of Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction, had chosen a picture of a semiautomatic rifle.","32":"Mr. Clinton should also press General Musharraf to sever ties with Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, a Kashmiri terrorist group backed by the Pakistani Army. He ought to insist that Pakistan use its close links with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to press for the expulsion of Osama bin Laden, the international terrorist implicated in the deadly bombings of two American embassies in Africa. Another goal should be to persuade Pakistan, as well as India, to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.","320":"Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted of 213 counts of murder in the Nairobi attack and of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans anywhere in the world.","3200":"The Bush administration has declared Abu Sayyaf a terrorist organization. A decade ago, when the group was founded with a goal to create an Islamic state, Osama bin Laden sent a brother-in-law to coordinate with the group. He provided money and sought to arrange a merger between Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a much larger group in the Philippines.","3202":"In the past few weeks I've started to have a heretical thought: Are we overreacting to 9/11? Are we going to drive ourselves crazy long before Osama bin Laden ever does?","3203":"Moreover, analysts regard the new taped message believed to be from Osama bin Laden as a summons to his followers, and perhaps to new sympathizers, to conduct actions against the American targets in response to the possible war in Iraq.","3205":"Mr. L\u00f3pez agreed. 'I don't respect Osama bin Laden,' he said. 'I don't respect the drugs or the smugglers, but we have a long history here. My kids went to school over there. An American can jump over this fence into Mexico, and no one will bother him. I jump over there and I'm in trouble. And I have papers.'","3206":"The war issue remained the 800-pound gorilla lounging about the hall in full combat gear as the Democrats sought to cobble a multi-issue agenda. They honed attacks on the president's deficit growth and tax shrinkage policies ('The surplus is harder to find than Osama bin Laden') and on the anxious-to-parlous state of homeland security ('the nation's color-coded nightmare').","3207":"Amos Oz (Op-Ed, Feb. 19) believes that an international coalition is necessary to prevent a backlash against America in any future invasion of Iraq. The problem with his position is that the Persian Gulf war was fought with such a coalition, which included all of the Western powers and even some Arab countries. Even so, Osama bin Laden directed his revenge primarily against America.","3208":"We must stop Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda now if we do not want to witness any more horrific days like Sept. 11.","3209":"In that context, it seems self-evident that restraining a government in power is easier than combating a stateless, elusive fanatic with little to lose. This is evidenced by our failure in Afghanistan to neutralize Osama bin Laden.","321":"Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted last week of 213 counts of murder in the Nairobi attack. Trial testimony showed that he was supposed to have died in the operation, but changed his mind and ran away after helping to deliver the bomb to the embassy. Mr. al-'Owhali was also convicted of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans.","3210":"Meanwhile, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said he would not set fire to oil wells or blow up the country's dams to impede any invasion force, according to excerpts of an interview with Dan Rather of CBS News. He also denied that his country had any connection with Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda.","3211":"For now, however, Saudi Arabia's rulers, despite grave misgivings about the wisdom of American bellicosity, will never give Osama bin Laden what he wants: forcing American troops out or otherwise backing away from Washington. They do not want to throw away the possibility that past closeness might somehow, someday, be restored. So they will allow the United States Air Force to continue its current operations, to run the air war from Prince Sultan Air Base, and to have its planes fly over Saudi territory while attacking Iraq from elsewhere.","3212":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 26\u2014 For months American troops and covert operatives have combed the rugged outlands of eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan in search of Osama bin Laden and his principal deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.","3213":"Mr. Heyward added: 'It appeared within the proper context, with tough, direct questions and perspective provided. This was not the Iraqi State of the Union Address. The White House is treating this as though it was an unfiltered message from Osama bin Laden.'","3214":"The fruitless hunt for Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is a reminder of the Bush administration's inability to achieve one of the main goals of its antiterror effort. Both are at large and apparently are the sources of taped exhortations for more violence. A12","3215":"On '60 Minutes II,' Mr. Rather pressed Mr. Hussein about the Al Samoud 2 missiles he has said he will not destroy. The anchor asked the Iraqi about Sept 11, and his relationship with Osama bin Laden, the one question that evinced an idiosyncratic reply: Mr. Hussein insisted he was not jealous of Mr. bin Laden's popularity on the Arab street. 'Jealousy is for women, and men are not supposed to be jealous of each other.'","3216":"While Osama bin Laden is still believed to be alive, the official said, a midlevel group of Qaeda operatives appear to be operating independently of him and may be plotting attacks on their own. The bureau suspects that countries outside Afghanistan and Pakistan may be giving safe haven to Qaeda operatives, he said.","3217":"For this show, he has photographed some of them, with suitable titles: 'The Miracle of Sanguineous Lachrymation' shows a monk weeping blood; 'The Miracle of Aquatic Trekking' portrays a pair of friars walking on water; 'The Miracle of the Flesh' depicts a student displaying the faces of Hitler and Osama bin Laden, each conjured up on a slice of Iberian ham. There is even a DVD projection in which a novice is shown learning to speak in tongues, with unprintable results.","3218":"Photos: Osama and Saddam? -- A poll released by the Pew Research Center two weeks ago showed that 57 percent of Americans are under the impression that Saddam Hussein 'helped the terrorists in the Sept. 11 attacks.' (Getty); (Reuters) Chart: 'The perception has persisted . . .' Numerous polls have probed Americans' assumptions about Saddam Hussein's role in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The results vary from poll to poll, and often depend on how a question is worded, but typically a third or more of respondents think Mr. Hussein had a hand in 9/11.

He has repeatedly eluded capture -- before and after Sept. 11. American officials have often said that, next to Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mohammed is the suspected terrorist leader they most wanted to catch.","3220":"'Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is one of Osama bin Laden's most senior and significant lieutenants, a key Al Qaeda planner and the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks,' said the statement, issued by Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary.","3221":"WASHINGTON, March 1\u2014 Of all the milestones in the Bush administration's 18-month campaign against terrorism, the apprehension of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, possibly the most fearsome of Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenants, came at a critical juncture.","3222":"Of the top Qaeda triumvirate of Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, no one played a more active role in the recruitment efforts, day-to-day operations and long-term planning than Mr. Mohammed, officials said. Mr. bin Laden is a symbolic and inspirational leader, while Mr. Mohammed, one official said, was Al Qaeda's 'details man.'","3224":"The Bush administration proved over the weekend that it can plan for war against Iraq and fight international terrorism at the same time. The capture in Pakistan of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a top operative of Al Qaeda who is suspected of planning the Sept. 11 attacks, was the most significant strike against the terror group since the United States dislodged the Osama bin Laden network from Afghanistan. America is safer today because Mr. Mohammed is in custody, and the C.I.A. and F.B.I. should be applauded for their role in his capture.","3225":"'It makes me feel good, because I've been frustrated that we didn't catch Osama bin Laden,' she said. 'Those people got away with murder. And in the last few weeks, we've been so tense about another bombing and now I feel really good: we're making progress.'","3226":"'Something that began with the incineration of 3,000 people still seems quite close,' said David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker. Last week, the New Yorker published a 20,000-word profile on Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, an assignment Mr. Remnick said would have been unthinkable a few years ago. 'People very much want to know who is on the other end of the equation, whether it is Jacques Chirac or Osama bin Laden.'","3227":"Mr. Mohammed, captured on Saturday in Pakistan after a yearslong pursuit, is in the custody of the C.I.A. at an undisclosed site outside Pakistan, officials said.

One of the officials told me that they had agreed to meet the writer, Michael Drosnin, author of a Nostradamus-style best seller, without understanding that he was promoting Biblical prophecy. Still, rather than shoo him away, they listened politely as he consumed several man-hours of valuable intelligence-crunching time. Apparently he has given similar briefings to top officials of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.","3245":"In the Treasury market, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 3.58 percent after the release of the February employment report showing the sharp decline in nonfarm payroll jobs. But as the stock market managed to shrug off an early loss, yields moved higher. Rumors, later denied, of the capture of two sons of Osama bin Laden also helped send yields higher.","3246":"Within two years of slipping away from Qatar, the C.I.A. now believes, Mr. Mohammed linked up with Osama bin Laden, became one of his most trusted lieutenants and brought with him an abiding interest in large-scale terrorist plots involving commercial airliners.","3247":"Less than two years later, Mr. Mohammed helped Osama bin Laden devise the strategy of using commercial airliners as missiles. In hindsight, intelligence officials are wondering whether the Sept. 11 attacks might have been averted had he been caught.","3248":"Critics of the administration's stance on Iraq have questioned its assertion that the Baghdad government has tolerated or even supported the Qaeda terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden.","325":"Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted last month by the same jury in the Nairobi attack, and of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans anywhere in the world.","3250":"CAIRO, March 8\u2014 The capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed provides American authorities with their best opportunity yet to prevent attacks by Al Qaeda and track down Osama bin Laden. But the detention also presents a tactical and moral challenge when it comes to the interrogation techniques used to obtain vital information.","3251":"Why? He estimated that 20 people die every week in Afghanistan in fierce fighting between tribes and between American and Taliban fighters. In truth, the fighting is far less intense than that. He also believes Osama bin Laden may be a C.I.A. agent and that the majority of members of the United States Congress are Jews. The source? A Web site and a pamphlet he received from a friend titled, 'The Jews and Influencing the International Mass Media.'","3252":"TERRORISTS -- Looking ahead, the Central Intelligence Agency warns that terrorists based in Iraq -- small groups affiliated with Al Qaeda and operating independently of Mr. Hussein's forces -- are planning attacks on allied forces during or after any invasion. Critics question Washington's claim that Baghdad has tolerated or supported terrorist followers of Osama bin Laden.","3253":"A Yemeni cleric was arrested in Germany on charges of financing terrorism, and United States prosecutors charged that he used a Brooklyn mosque to raise millions of dollars for Osama bin Laden. The cleric, Sheik Muhammad Ali Hassan al-Mouyad, told an F.B.I. informant that he was Mr. bin Laden's spiritual adviser, and authorities said they traced suspicious bank deposits to five people associated with the Al Farooq mosque in Brooklyn. The mosque, which denied any knowledge of the plot, is the same one where Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman -- convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center -- served as imam in 1990. Eric Lichtblau","3254":"American and Pakistani intelligence units have begun an operation in the northernmost district of the Pakistan, along the border with Afghanistan, in hopes of capturing Osama bin Laden. Further south, the police in Baluchistan have also been told to prepare for a possible operation. The activity follows the arrest of one of Mr. Bin Laden's top deputies, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, on March. 1.","3256":"The ghost is with us today, in the antagonism between Turkey and the Kurds in any war over Iraq. It was with us two years ago, when Osama bin Laden, in a televised message, said the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were in retaliation for what the West had done 80 years earlier: divvy up the remains of the Ottoman Empire.","3257":"Pictures of Osama bin Laden were not as evident as they were at the previous weekend's march in Karachi, but one sign, in Urdu, read: 'Mullah Omar, Osama, Saddam -- We Honor Your Courage.'","3258":"Some critics cited a protest placard that compared legislators to Osama bin Laden and a letter, distributed on the Internet by a North Brunswick urologist, that likened a ranking state senator to Saddam Hussein. Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen, chairman of the commerce and banking committee, whose office was picketed by 80 doctors, said the vitriol was excessive, and in the end, counterproductive. 'The doctors got carried away with themselves,' he said.","3259":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 10\u2014 Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the lieutenant of Al Qaeda captured in Pakistan nine days ago, told interrogators that he met with Osama bin Laden in December but refused to describe the location, Pakistan's top intelligence officials said tonight in the first detailed, official account of the arrest and questioning of Mr. Mohammed.","3260":"Both American and Israeli intelligence are now using the Bible Code to hunt for Osama bin Laden. What possible loss is there in that?","3261":"Judge Zeiher noted that the men were not followers of Osama bin Laden, and did not have contact with those who plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks while living in Hamburg.","3262":"Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a Qaeda lieutenant captured in Pakistan nine days ago, told interrogators that he met with Osama bin Laden in December but refused to describe the location. A12","3263":"But after graduating from a Catholic high school in 2000, Mr. Jabarah changed course, traveling to Pakistan to study Islam. There he met Osama bin Laden, who was impressed with his clean Canadian passport and English language skills, according to a Canadian Security Intelligence Service report.","3264":"A woman wondered why Islamic moderates do not seem to speak up against the militants. 'That quiet, Mr. Rogers-like voice, I can't hear it,' she said. One man asked about radicalism in the madrassas, Islamic religious schools. Another asked if the Koran did not compel Muslims 'to kill nonbelievers.' Yet another had Osama bin Laden on his mind.","3265":"'I'm thankful,' she says softly. 'I'm doing this for a little girl somewhere in the middle of America with fuzzy hair and yellow skin, who will see my name and the power of an Eastern name that is not Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein.'","3266":"The most recent audiotape message that was purported to have been from Osama bin Laden, broadcast by Al Jazeera, the Arab television station, was partly intended to be a call to arms for Al Qaeda, counterterrorism officials said. In the 16-minute message, the speaker, whom the authorities say they now believe was indeed Mr. bin Laden, exhorts Muslims to seize the chance to defend President Saddam Hussein's 'godless' government, portraying an invasion as an unwarranted attack against all Muslims by the United States.","3267":"Mr. Credico illustrated Colin L. Powell's testimony before the United Nations with shadow puppets. He posited that we hate Osama bin Laden because he made Rudy Giuliani a hero. He imagined the president saying: 'First of all, it is our oil. It happens to be 8,000 miles below Kansas.'","3268":"The American military bases that were established in Saudi Arabia as a result of the war gave Muslim militants like Osama bin Laden a pretext for attacking the Saudi rulers. Hopes for an Arab-Israeli peace have evaporated, fueling more Islamic militancy. Anger at the United States, both for its support of Israel and its defense of autocratic Arab rulers, has become widespread.","3269":"Viewers' expectations of instant, live coverage of war have grown considerably since the Persian Gulf war in 1991. But particularly since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, television has become a powerful way for combatants to wage it. From Osama bin Laden's video threats on the Arabic-language network, Al Jazeera, to the Pentagon briefings serving as a voice-over narration for the images of bombing in Afghanistan, television has been put to military use by both sides.","327":"A Sudanese man, Abdil Rauf Hawas, suspected of working for the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden was arrested along with an Indian accomplice, Shamim Sarvar, for allegedly planning to blow up the American Embassy in India, domestic news agencies reported. (AP)","3270":"Record stores are full of compilations repackaging trip-hop as 'chillout,' a term that began as a hip-hop imperative ('Chill out!'), named a clubland retreat ('the chillout room' to which dancers repair for a break from the action) and now signifies both a state of New Age serenity and the songs that provide its soundtrack: soothing music, with a slow beat and a bit of atmosphere, suitable for a spot of post-yoga housework, and for forgetting that Osama bin Laden is still at large. '100th Window' ends with what sounds like a wink at chillout: a gurgling 13-minute-long bass line that Mr. Del Naja has said he included for listeners 'to do dinner to.' But unlike most music it has inspired, Massive Attack's songs are too chilling to be chill.","3271":"Or would they simply disappear, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan, and become 'shadows' eluding their American pursuers, as Tariq Aziz, one of Saddam Hussein's most trusted advisers, predicted in an interview with an American reporter last October?","3272":"Millions supported Stalin and Hitler; they were misled. Millions opposed the placement of Pershing missiles in Eastern Europe; they were overreacting. Millions demonstrate in support of Hamas, Hezbollah, Yasir Arafat, Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein; they are misguided.","3273":"Nonetheless, sellers of health and safety products are gamely pushing products they mistakenly figured would be slam-dunks last year. Then, they pushed them as balm for Osama bin Laden-induced fears; now, they suggest that the products can guard against retaliation for an attack on Baghdad.","3274":"Yemen, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, has entered into an uneasy alliance with the Bush administration in the campaign against terrorism. Yemen has received about $100 million in American assistance for antiterrorist activities, but remains an attractive hiding place for Islamic militants.","3275":"Counterterrorism officials said a senior leader of Al Qaeda captured earlier this month in Pakistan has told interrogators that Osama bin Laden personally selected the targets for the Sept. 11 attacks. A22","3276":"This is a sharp change in strategy from the Afghanistan campaign and its aftermath when the Bush White House considered Al Jazeera as a propaganda outlet for Osama bin Laden and Qaeda. The network has been the exclusive outlet for tapes with the voice of Mr. bin Laden, and other Al Qaeda messages, all of which created significant news around the world.","3277":"It was a chance Mr. Bush missed, to his regret, early in the war in Afghanistan in 2001, when American forces sought to kill Osama bin Laden and the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar.","3278":"This war began with both. The major blows were cruise missile attacks from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and strikes by F-117 stealth fighters against three 'leadership targets,' an apparent effort to decapitate Saddam Hussein's regime. The strike recalled the cruise missile attack the Clinton administration mounted -- unsuccessfully -- to try to kill Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. It was an attempt to end the war with a single, decisive blow.","3279":"WASHINGTON, March 19\u2014 A senior leader of Al Qaeda captured early this month in Pakistan has told interrogators that Osama bin Laden personally selected the targets for the Sept. 11 attacks and rejected plans for an even broader assault on prominent American buildings, officials said today.","3280":"After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, CBS postponed two episodes of 'The Agency,' one dealing overtly with Osama bin Laden and the other with an anthrax attack. Fox also edited the pilot of '24' that year to tone down an explosion aboard an airplane.","3281":"Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar and many of his senior commanders remain at large. They are widely reported to be staying in the tribal areas of Pakistan along the Afghan border and in the large provincial towns like Quetta, close to the Afghan border. Since the arrest of a top Qaeda operative, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, in Pakistan two weeks ago, there has been wide speculation in Pakistan that the net is closing on Mr. bin Laden.","3282":"The bombing occurred in April at Tarnak Farms, a former Al Qaeda base once owned by Osama bin Laden that had been converted early last year into a firing range for coalition troops. A squad of Canadian light infantrymen were conducting night exercises with machine guns and an antitank grenade launcher when the two pilots, en route to an airborne refueling, mistook the muzzle flashes from the Canadians' weapons for hostile ground-to-air fire.","3283":"The painstaking technical analysis of the tape is similar to the work the agency has been forced to conduct over the past year on a series of videotapes and audiotapes said to be issued by Osama bin Laden to determine whether they were forgeries designed to convince the United States that the terrorist leader was still alive.","3284":"Hyperbole aside, weakening Al Qaeda and capturing its leader will save more lives. The war in Iraq is strengthening Al Qaeda's recruiting and has become the mission of 250,000 people who could be looking for Osama bin Laden.","3285":"Shortly after a Yemeni cleric who described himself as a spiritual adviser to Osama bin Laden was arrested on charges of using a Brooklyn mosque to funnel millions of dollars to Al Qaeda, the city's Department of Correction reassigned a leader of the mosque who is also a chaplain at Rikers Island.","3286":"I. In the days after Sept. 11, 2001, many people anticipated a quick and satisfying American victory over Al Qaeda. The terrorist army was thought to be no bigger than a pirate ship, and the newly vigilant police forces of the entire world were going to sink the ship with swift arrests and dark maneuvers. Al Qaeda was driven from its bases in Afghanistan. Arrests and maneuvers duly occurred and are still occurring. Just this month, one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants was nabbed in Pakistan. Police agents, as I write, seem to be hot on the trail of bin Laden himself, or so reports suggest.","3287":"At Mr. Bush's sedated show there were no raised voices, not a single query about homeland security or Osama bin Laden. As Billy Flynn says, one idea at a time is enough for the journalistic pack -- in this case the administration's id\u00e9e fixe of Iraq. And like their 'Chicago' counterparts, the Washington press corps were more than willing to buy fictions if instructed to do so by the puppeteer. 'Eight times [Mr. Bush] interchanged the war on Iraq with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,' wrote The New York Observer, 'and eight times he was unchallenged.' The unproven but constantly reiterated White House claim of a Qaeda-Saddam Hussein connection has now become a settled fact, not to be questioned at a press conference any more than any 'Chicago' reporter challenges the mythical pregnancy Billy Flynn flogs in his propaganda campaign to save Roxie Hart.","3288":"The reasoning is that President Bush cannot hope to stabilize the region, much less democratize Arab states, so long as the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians endures as a propaganda tool for the likes of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. After the war with Iraq, Arab leaders will demand that President Bush 'prove what he can do for peace,' Dennis Ross, the former Clinton administration negotiator, wrote last week in The Wall Street Journal.","3289":"'There is no guarantee that they will kill Saddam Hussein because they have not managed to kill Osama bin Laden.'","329":"The suspected plot was the latest turn in an investigation that was characterized by early breakthroughs but has since failed to provide American and Yemeni officials with the hard evidence they need to win convictions. They have not yet established who was ultimately responsible for the attack, officials said, though Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist, was identified as a prime suspect from the start.","3291":"'The atmosphere is boiling,' declared Mohsen al-Awajy, a tall, angular Islamic scholar, distinguished by a long beard and white head scarf without the usual black headband. He says even his daughters are urging him to join Al Qaeda and follow Osama bin Laden.","3292":"Mr. Brown said that Mr. Mosed had known that the camp 'was affiliated with Osama bin Laden, and that's something he's very ashamed of.'","3293":"No such calming effect is in order for Peter L. Bergen's quick-paced, action-packed 'Al Qaeda 2.0.' Mr. Bergen is the author of 'Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden' (The Free Press, 2001). In March 1997, while working as a producer for CNN, Mr. Bergen, along with Peter Arnett, interviewed Mr. bin Laden, and 'Al Qaeda 2.0' opens with Mr. bin Laden saying, 'Targeting the Americans and the Jews by killing them in any corner of the earth is the greatest of obligations and the most excellent way of gaining nearness to Allah.'","3294":"Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia also started publicly addressing the issue of reform, although that seems more inspired by the post-Sept. 11 discovery of widespread sympathy for Osama bin Laden rather than concern that democracy in Iraq might destabilize the kingdom.","3296":"Fears of terrorist attacks against shipping have increased since a speedboat packed with explosives rammed and crippled a French oil tanker off Yemen last fall. A subsequent audiotape believed to have been made by Osama bin Laden praised and seemed to take responsibility for the suicide attack.","3297":"It is distracting the nation from the failure to capture Osama bin Laden, he said. It is being run by a conservative Republican administration, while Mr. Britt is a Democrat. It was ordered by a president who Mr. Britt does not even believe was legitimately elected.","3298":"It was not one of the kind sold in souks across the Arab world, with a glaring Osama bin Laden or the airliners crashing into the twin towers. Rather, with palm trees and sand in the foreground, it was a picture of paradise -- Manhattan on the Euphrates.","3299":"The war that the rest of the world sees is different from the one Americans are viewing. The Pakistani newspaper Awami Awaz exults that 'Iraqi leadership has humiliated the Americans.' The Egyptian newspaper Al Wafd titles an editorial 'The U.S. Empire of Evil.' Muslim figures who sided with the U.S. after 9/11 and denounced Osama bin Laden are now urging 'jihad' against Americans.","33":"In contrast, the Colombian United Self-Defense, as Mr. Castano's private 5,500-member army is called, has been described as a band of murderous thugs in human rights reports published in the last month by the State Department, the United Nations and the private monitoring group Human Rights Watch. As a result, the State Department is seeking to have Mr. Castano's group added to its list of terrorist organizations along with the likes of Osama bin Laden, who is accused of blowing up American embassies.","330":"That blast and a nearly simultaneous bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, were part of a global conspiracy to kill Americans that prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan. Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, will be sentenced on Sept. 12 to life in prison without parole for the 213 deaths in the Nairobi bombing.","3300":"As long as Saddam Hussein is able to maintain even the appearance of control, high-level defections seem unlikely. However, once the battle turns decisively, the efforts to entice his underlings -- if they include offers of amnesty -- could pay off with surrenders in the field, or at least information about where Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are hidden. After all, unlike the lieutenants of Osama bin Laden, most of those who have served Saddam Hussein during the last 20 years have been seeking paradise on earth, not in heaven.","3301":"The four men were convicted of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa, which killed 224 people and wounded thousands.","3302":"At the camp, which offered military and jihad indoctrination, one of the men, Sahim Alwan, disillusioned, faked an injury and left after 10 days. Before leaving, he met with Osama bin Laden, who asked whether any young men in America would engage in suicide missions. Mr. Alwan said in a court filing that he 'changed the subject.'","3303":"The two industries know, from experience with Desert Storm, the raid of Mogadishu in Somalia and the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, that new battle tools will be showcased by the armed services, and they could be new battle toys by December.","3304":"In a way, it is no surprise that more women than men oppose the war with Iraq. The gender gap on issues of war and military spending has been obvious at least since pollsters first thought to measure such a thing. On the eve of the gulf war in 1991, 67 percent of American men favored an attack on Iraq, for example, compared with 45 percent of women. On the eve of this war, two-thirds of American men supported it, compared with half of American women, according to a poll by The Washington Post. The only real exception to this pattern of opinion came right after Sept. 11, when roughly equal numbers of women and men favored military action in what was then said to be the terrorist stronghold, Afghanistan, against the man who was then said to be the enemy, Osama bin Laden. Those were the days when choosy mothers were choosing Cipro, when maternalism briefly acquired a martial edge and when a shared sense of vulnerability and outrage swamped some of the familiar political divides.","3305":"Saddam Hussein could escape, denying the war effort a definitive totem of victory. It sounds improbable, given the terrifying array of force available to the coalition, but other notorious figures remain at large despite intensive manhunts, including the wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the Qaeda mastermind, Osama bin Laden.","3306":"LOOKING BACK -- As the fighting continued, it was increasingly apparent that the failure to obtain Turkey's permission for American troops to cross its territory and open a northern front had been a diplomatic debacle, and that the allies had miscalculated in bypassing Basra and Nasiriya and in expecting that Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq would rise up against President Hussein. Other perils threatened: A long war that would try American patience; the likelihood that street fighting, with heavy casualties, might be needed to take Baghdad; even the possibility that Mr. Hussein might escape, as Osama bin Laden did, or that no weapons of mass destruction would be found, making the war look like a wild-goose chase.","3307":"Purdy is at his best describing the people he met on his travels. One might well object that there is nothing representative about them: he talks to the Bill Gates of India; he manages to find a non-Coptic Christian family in Egypt (who complained that the Americans weren't as tough on Muslims as the Israelis were). But for somebody who lives so much in his head, Purdy is a surprisingly sharp observer. Mainly, what he observes is paradox, contradiction -- the woman lawyer in Cairo, Westernized in every way except that she has refound her Islamic faith and declares that if Osama bin Laden had attacked the White House, 'no one could have said it was murder'; or the cosmopolitan gay AIDS activist in Bombay, who believes Hinduism 'needs a whip' to use against the Muslims; or the upwardly mobile students at Beijing University who see through the government's Marxist rhetoric and tell Purdy that what China requires is 'to be ruled by good kings.'","3308":"Al Jazeera has also been a vital source of information about Al Qaeda. Its reporters have had access to Qaeda leaders, and tapes of Osama bin Laden have found their way to the station's offices. This has been a useful window on a world that for too long has been utterly alien to us.","3309":"Born in Puerto Rico, Ms. Mercado talks with forceful hand gestures. She guides younger neighbors, explaining to one that Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden are not the same thing. She translates for her husband, Freddy, who speaks mostly Spanish and who, she explains, doesn't like war but supports the president.","331":"The group consists mostly of men who had joined Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and suspected terrorist, in fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's.","3310":"One of the Muslim variations eventually emerged as the Islamist radicalism of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and other movements. A second version evolved into Saddam Hussein's Baath dictatorship. The European inspiration for those movements is not too hard to detect, especially in the case of the Baath, which got started in 1943 in an atmosphere of ardent sympathy for the fascist Axis.","3311":"Mr. Rivera delivered many outlandish reports for Fox News when he raced to Afghanistan vowing to personally hunt down Osama bin Laden. One report in particular, however, in which he erroneously claimed to be standing on 'hallowed ground' where American soldiers had been killed by friendly fire, should have given Fox second thoughts about giving him an important assignment in Iraq.","3312":"The marines said they needed no other motivation than Sept. 11 to fight this battle. Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, they said, were nothing more than loose strings in a world of disorder.","3313":"There remains one crucial difference this time, however. Many Arab governments, still reeling from the bloodshed fomented at home by the veterans of the Afghan war, especially those who ended up under the tutelage of Osama bin Laden, seek to bar the route. The notable exception is the government of Saddam Hussein.","3314":"Mr. Benmerzouga possessed more than 60 films promoting suicide bombings and martyrdom, including 19 copies of a video of Osama bin Laden.","3315":"On those occasions when the comedy-concert film 'Dysfunktional Family' gives Eddie Griffin a chance to step out of the bag that has become a package of surefire, guffaw-forcing clich\u00e9s for African-American comedians -- boring mockery of square white people, low-grade homophobia, comments like the feds can't find Osama bin Laden but 'they can find my 4-foot 11-inch cousin in Compton' -- it's worth paying attention to. But in 'Family' that occurs with any consistency only in the last 20 minutes. There is a blueprint here for what should be the next wave of comedy-concert movies, but the filmmaking team has only used part of it.","3316":"Similar patterns developed in the Middle East. The founder of Saddam Hussein's fascist Baath Party studied German Romanticism, including, Mr. Berman notes, 'the philosophers of national destiny, of race and of the integrity of national cultures.' . One of the most influential Islamist philosophers, Sayyid Qutb (pronounced KUH-tahb), who was executed by Nasser in 1966, studied in the West and then, like many other Islamic radicals, rebelled against modernity and secularism (his brother taught Osama bin Laden). The Ayatollah Khomeini, who lived in Paris before the 1979 Iranian revolution, combined phrases of Fanon and Sartre with his totalitarian Islamicism.","3317":"The Manila plot has received increased attention since the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, an aide to Osama bin Laden who is suspected of helping to mastermind the Sept. 11 attacks.","3318":"If true, Mr. Mohammed's account would tend to support Mr. Moussaoui in his assertion that while he is a dedicated member of the Qaeda terror network and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he had nothing to do with the events of Sept. 11, which are at the center of his December 2001 indictment.","3319":"Mr. Masri supports Osama bin Laden, praises as martyrs those who carried out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and has called Prime Minister Tony Blair a 'legitimate target' for Muslim warriors.","332":"The incident was cited by prosecutors yesterday in their effort to persuade the jury in Federal District Court to impose the death penalty on Mr. Mohamed, who was convicted of 11 counts of murder in the Tanzania attack and also of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans.","3321":"As recently as a week ago, Washington talked glibly of 'decapitation.' But no vainglorious pledge was made to capture Mr. Hussein, 'dead or alive,' as had been made with respect to the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, who is embarrassingly still at large, as far as anyone here can discover.","3323":"There remains the unfinished business of Osama bin Laden. But the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom should not mark the beginning of Operation Eternal War.","3324":"BUFFALO, April 8\u2014 A man who said he had two one-on-one meetings with Osama bin Laden a few months before the Sept. 11 terror attacks pleaded guilty today to aiding Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization.","3325":"Officials said it would still take more time to conclusively determine Mr. Hussein's fate, and might require DNA testing of remains at the site of the bombing. The frustrating experience of searching Afghanistan and Pakistan in vain for Osama bin Laden over the past year has prompted many officials to be cautious about making definitive statements about Mr. Hussein's status.","3327":"Triumph in Iraq, if the whole nation goes the way of Basra and Baghdad, would mark the second important American victory in a row, after Afghanistan. But success there, like that in the first gulf war, was incomplete; the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden apparently remains at large, either in Afghanistan or elsewhere, as did Mr. Hussein after the powerful allied advance in the first gulf war was halted shy of the Iraqi heartland.","3328":"It is no surprise that John McCain, the Senate's pork-sniffing watchdog, is demanding to know what extra millions for South Pole research can possibly contribute to the hunt for Osama bin Laden. But it is even more gratifying that the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, shares this sense of outrage at the Senate's last-minute fiddling with the war bill. The House added only help for the stricken airline industry, and Mr. DeLay protested the Senate's exploiting the measure with much more of a frenzy of disconnected spending. He called on House-Senate conferees to strip the final measure back closer to the 'clean' war appropriations bill originally sent by the White House.","3329":"Many Arab governments and others have exploited the Palestinian issue to their advantage over the years, including to distract from real problems at home. Even Osama bin Laden, who initially ignored the Palestine issue, elevated it to the top as he sought to rally support for his cause after the horror of 9/11. Similarly, Saddam Hussein declared, as American troops surrounded Baghdad, 'Long live Iraq, long live Palestine.' That these are acts of deliberate manipulation is clear enough. But these acts employ the Palestinian issue precisely because no other issue resonates more with people in the region, providing the shortest cut to their sense of collective identity.","3330":"Mr. Hmimssa testified that the defendants praised Osama bin Laden and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. The three Dearborn-based defendants worked at the Detroit airport, and Mr. Hmimssa said that Mr. Koubriti, who worked at an airline catering company, once threatened to poison the food. He also testified that Mr. Ali-Haimoud wanted 'to slit the throat of infidels' and that Mr. Hannan held Las Vegas in contempt because Arabs he considered corrupt went there to gamble.","3331":"The police said after the arrest that they believed the two had acted alone and did not have connections with international terrorist organizations, although they found a photograph of Osama bin Laden in their apartment.","3332":"Yet, in Iraq, there was perhaps a more complex dynamic. Not just many Iraqis but also the United States wanted to draw a final line -- beneath 'regime change,' beneath the ambiguities of the past when Washington supported Mr. Hussein against Iran, beneath America's own humiliation in bombing Afghanistan only to fail in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","3333":"Yet for all the worry, federal officials now say that so far there is little evidence that Al Qaeda or other terrorist networks are preparing to strike the United States -- despite warnings from Middle Eastern leaders like President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt that war in Iraq would unleash 'a hundred new Osama bin Ladens' and even an audiotape, purportedly made by bin Laden, calling for suicide attacks.","3334":"Though hardly alone since Sept. 11 in making this claim, Berman is one of the few commentators who haven't used the label simply as an epithet. He wants us to see Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein -- not to mention such affiliated villains as the Taliban, Hezbollah and Hamas -- in a new light, as heirs to a mode of thought handed down by the Bolsheviks, fascists and Nazis, and anticipated in the words and deeds of Saint-Just, Dostoyevsky's Ivan Karamazov and an assortment of bomb-throwing anarchists. Left or right, Berman argues, liberalism's sworn foes have always shared the same ideal -- 'submission,' 'the one, instead of the many,' 'the total state, the total doctrine, the total movement' -- and, upon encountering intransigent reality, have always brought in their wake the same bloody result: 'a cult of death.'","3335":"Mr. Powell also that the Iraqi government was harboring 'a deadly terrorist network' of 20 Qaeda members, led by Abu Musaab al-Zarqawi, an associate of Osama bin Laden.","3336":"A second group has formed around the former Taliban corps commander of Kandahar, Maulavi Akhtar Muhammad Usmani, who, Afghan intelligence officials say, was behind the ambush on the American Special Forces here. He is a close ally of Mullah Omar and is believed to retain very strong links with members of the Pakistan military intelligence service, General Khakrezwal said. Finally there is a group called Jaish-e-Muhammad, led by Akbar Agha, who is known to have been close to Osama bin Laden, he said.","3337":"Mr. Bashir, 64, has always denied any link to terrorism, but the United States says Jemaah Islamiyah has connections to Al Qaeda, and Mr. Bashir has expressed admiration for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government of Afghanistan.","3338":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Last week, the C.I.A. was leaning toward believing that Saddam Hussein was alive and Osama bin Laden was dead. This week, the C.I.A. is leaning toward believing that Osama bin Laden is alive and Saddam Hussein is dead.","3339":"Mr. Moussaoui, who is facing the death penalty, has acknowledged that he is a Qaeda member, is loyal to Osama bin Laden and was sent to the United States on a mission for the terrorist network. But he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","334":"An F.B.I. agent told the jury that the notes had been found in the Metropolitan Correctional Center cell that was shared by two men who were then awaiting trial on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, in a global terrorism conspiracy that included the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","3340":"As Mr. Abbas was taken into custody, United States officials were still sifting through documents and rounding up Iraqi officials in preparation for a thorough examination of the connections between the toppled government and the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden.","3341":"The national level has bounced between yellow and orange since the much-ridiculed system started last year. The level was last raised to orange on March 17 in the expectation of an American invasion of Iraq, an event that intelligence and law enforcement agencies had predicted could spark terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad. An audiotape believed to have been recorded by Osama bin Laden shortly before the war called on his followers to carry out suicide attacks on American targets.","3342":"Mr. al Nalfi was taken to the United States in 2000 and charged in the broad terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa. In January, Mr. al Nalfi pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of conspiring to destroy national defense materials and was sentenced in February to 10 years in prison, the maximum term.","3343":"The RQ-1 Predator isn't much to look at. It's a glider with an engine just powerful enough to reach the cruising speed of a Chevrolet. But back in 2000, when the C.I.A. thought it had Osama bin Laden under live aerial surveillance in Afghanistan, it pressed for a weaponized version of the Predator. In the fall of 2001, with Hellfire missiles grafted to its fragile wings, the little reconnaissance drone made its first remote-controlled kills. Just last month, the Predator again made history, taking out Iraqi antiaircraft batteries while its operators remained safely away from the battlefield.","3345":"For the many Latin Americans who believe history is one long conspiracy, the Iraq invasion has been like manna from heaven. Even before it, some intellectuals argued that Osama bin Laden was really an American double agent who organized the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in complicity with the C.I.A. in order to justify military intervention in the Islamic world.","3347":"He was not the only Arab fanatic to see the past within the present. There is a direct line back from Osama bin Laden to Sayyid Qutb, the founder of the Egyptian radical group that assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Qutb made no secret of being influenced by Ibn Taymiyya, a 14th century clerical jurist whose violent views about Islam were provoked by his own family's having to flee Baghdad during the Mongol invasions. Sayyid Qutb said that history is 'a memory determined by the authority of the foundational age of Islam.'","3348":"Prosecutors say that Mr. Salim was a top aide to Osama bin Laden, and he still faces separate charges of participating in a terrorism conspiracy that included the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, in which more than 200 people were killed.","335":"MADRID, June 22\u2014 Spanish police officers today arrested an Algerian man who was wanted on terrorism charges in France and Germany, and who is thought to have ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused by the United States of masterminding the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","3350":"She notes an inability to listen. Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda have openly expressed their hatred of Christians, Jews and Americans, and their desire for random murder. And yet, in her estimation, all too many people in the universities and in the pulpits profess to be in the dark about Al Qaeda's true intentions, or pretend to know the real reason behind the attack -- some modest, real-world complaint about American or Israeli policies.","3351":"American and Kurdish officials say the group received support from Al Qaeda and coordinated activities through Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian identified by the United States as a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden. They also said the group ran a factory that made the poison ricin and a topical cyanide poison and maintained ties with Mr. Hussein.","3353":"The presence of thousands of American soldiers in Saudi Arabia, the land of Islam's two holiest shrines, Mecca and Medina, has enraged some militant Muslims. It is among the reasons given by Osama bin Laden for his hatred of the United States.","3354":"Mr. Moussaoui, who acknowledged that he was a member of the Qaeda network and was loyal to Osama bin Laden, has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks.","3355":"The American presence here began as a joint operation to contain Saddam Hussein after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, but increasingly became dangerous for the American troops involved because Osama bin Laden and fellow terrorists resented their presence in the land of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. Twenty-four American soldiers died in two separate terrorist strikes here in 1995 and 1996.","3356":"The episode offered a rare look into American efforts to apprehend or kill Mr. Hussein, who now ranks with Osama bin Laden as America's most wanted man. But it also demonstrated the difficulties faced by the American military in trying to sort out useful leads from the plethora of information that is flowing in from Iraqis.","3357":"Osama bin Laden rose to prominence stoking Muslim anger over the American military presence in the land of Islam's holiest shrines. So yesterday's announcement that United States military forces will withdraw from Saudi Arabia fortifies the Saudi royal family against its most vociferous critics at home.","3358":"The direction that seems likely is a distinct loosening of the most obvious ties that have bound the two governments in recent years: American military bases in Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden has cited the presence of American troops in the land of the holy Islamic shrines of Mecca and Medina as a major reason for his war against the United States, and 15 of the 19 hijackers he used to destroy the World Trade Center and hit the Pentagon were Saudi.","3359":"Mr. Ba'Attash has been identified by American intelligence officials as an important lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, and deeply involved in many of Al Qaeda's most deadly plots. He is thought to have used many different aliases in recent years, including Tawfiq al-Atash and Tawfiq bin Atash.","336":"Officials speculated that the threat might be related to the Khobar Towers indictment, and might involve groups related to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been charged by the United States with leading the conspiracy to blow up two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.","3360":"Mr. Atwan, who interviewed and was photographed with Osama bin Laden in 1996, frequently appears on British broadcast outlets as a commentator on Arab developments. He said his newspaper was a likely recipient of a letter from Mr. Hussein because it answered to no Arab governments and vigorously opposed the war.","3361":"Over the last decade, Osama bin Laden advocated the overthrow of secular leaders like Saddam Hussein and the removal of American forces from Saudi Arabia. Who would have guessed that the Bush administration would be so accommodating?","3363":"Today, Pakistan's President said Osama bin Laden might be alive and hidden in the tribal areas, Reuters reported.","3364":"But prosecutors have repeatedly invoked national security concerns to keep information from Mr. Moussaoui, an acknowledged loyalist of Osama bin Laden. The prosecutors say Mr. Moussaoui will never receive clearance to view classified material.","3365":"Where is Saddam Hussein? Where is Osama bin Laden?","3366":"Mr. Vicale, 42, says he has been entirely too busy lately. In the 14 months he has owned the company, he said, he has sold 15,000 to 20,000 hand-painted dolls, all made entirely in the United States. He received death threats, he said, after producing an Osama bin Laden doll in a pink dress. Then came two versions of Saddam Hussein -- Saddam Insane, with the 1980's-style 'teardrop crackhead glasses,' Mr. Vicale said, and the Butcher of Baghdad, in a green uniform.","3367":"Of course, this does not mean negotiating with terrorist groups over goals like Al Qaeda's quest to replace the Western-inspired system of nation-states with a global caliphate. Osama bin Laden seeks no compromise. But most of the people who sympathize with him just might.","3368":"Anyway, it was quite a show. Luckily for Mr. Bush, the frustrating search for Osama bin Laden somehow morphed into a good old-fashioned war, the kind where you seize the enemy's capital and get to declare victory after a cheering crowd pulls down the tyrant's statue. (It wasn't much of a crowd, and American soldiers actually brought down the statue, but it looked great on TV.)","3369":"The court also upheld a drug charge against the man, Osman Petmezci, who was arrested last September after the police found gunpowder, chemicals, six metal pipes and a poster of Osama bin Laden in his apartment. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail by the Heidelberg state court.","337":"Mr. Sharon is also expected to raise allegations that Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi dissident and accused terrorist, is seeking to establish a network of agents in Israel, his aides said.","3370":"Osama bin Laden couldn't be found, so Saddam Hussein took his place.","3371":"By the time I've read 'Why you should get to know me' and 'More about who I'm looking for,' the tabulations are in. As in real life, I respond to half the men because of some combination of looks and personality. For instance, the guy who's 'funny and smart' isn't Shakespeare, but he's cute and admits he likes Frank Sinatra. Or someone with a borderline picture can make me laugh out loud: 'Celebrity I resemble most: My ex told me I have soft lips like Osama bin Laden.'","3372":"That Al Qaeda remains active in Saudi Arabia is not a surprise. Its founder, Osama bin Laden, is a Saudi, and he has long cited his homeland and the royal Al Saud family as the principal exhibits in his efforts to enlist fellow Muslims in a jihad, or holy war, against what he has portrayed as corrupt Arab rulers and their Western allies.","3373":"Now suddenly there is a paradigm shift, as the think-tank fellows are inclined to observe, and the globe seems to be growing. Or perhaps falling apart. After 9/11, whole areas of the world have regressed into no-go zones. Fascinating far-flung countries, once readily accessible to college kids with backpacks, no less than hardy retirees in sensible shoes, now might as well have fire-breathing dragons stenciled on their maps. The hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war in Afghanistan, chaos throughout Central Asia, the war in Iraq and the attendant unrest in the Middle East, terrorist attacks on paradises as different as Tunisia and Bali and, in recent weeks, SARS have given millions of potential travelers good reasons to stay home until the situation stabilizes and things return to normal.","3376":"A fifth member of the 'Lackawanna Six' pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that he attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. Yasein Taher, 25, is one of six Americans of Yemeni heritage living in Lackawanna, a Buffalo suburb, who were arrested last September in a highly publicized raid. Against the advice of his lawyer, Mr. Taher pleaded guilty yesterday to providing material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. In the plea agreement, Mr. Taher said that he had trained in the use of automatic weapons, had heard a speech by Osama bin Laden and had performed guard duty. The charge carries a maximum 10-year sentence, but prosecutors agreed to recommend an eight-year term. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 4.","3377":"Osama bin Laden had made chasing American forces out of the Arabian Peninsula -- which is considered sacred by some extremists because the faith was founded there -- one of his primary goals.","3378":"Still, a sense of unease grew more urgent after a Saudi raid last Tuesday uncovered a large cache of explosives in Riyadh but failed to net the Qaeda operatives who were the raid's target. It increased further over the weekend, when a Saudi group believed to be affiliated with Osama bin Laden's network called for revenge attacks to follow the Saudi raid.","3379":"The rulers have long sought to distinguish between fiery, xenophobic sermons blasting from the loudspeakers of the country's mosques and the violence that some justify in the name of Islam. The dynasty portrays the violence as something alien, despite the fact that it is often perpetrated by Saudi-bred men like Osama bin Laden.","338":"Memo From: Osama bin Laden","3380":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia\u2014 On Monday night, Riyadh didn't sleep. Phone lines were jammed and streets were crowded. The news was devastating: three suicide bombings at housing complexes for Westerners here in the Saudi capital had killed more than 20 people and wounded nearly 200, some of them Saudi. Only days earlier, Saudi officials had described Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda as 'weak and nonexistent.' But on Monday night, Saudis were asking, 'Is Osama behind these attacks?'","3381":"That had a familiar ring. It was reminiscent of another statement by the president, shortly after Sept. 11. Speaking of Osama bin Laden, he said: 'They used to put out there in the old West a wanted poster. It said 'Wanted Dead or Alive.' All I want, and America wants him brought to justice. That's what we want.'","3384":"American investigators have linked the Cole bombing to Al Qaeda and believe that the attack was planned by senior deputies of Osama bin Laden, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who was captured in Pakistan in March and is also thought to be an architect of the Sept. 11 attacks. Another aide to Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi citizen named Walid Ba'Attash, regarded as the possible mastermind of the Cole bombing, was also captured in Pakistan.","3385":"Both Mr. Badawi and Mr. Quso could face the death penalty if convicted in the United States. The two men are regarded as relatively low-level participants in the bombing. But more senior leaders of Al Qaeda, including its founder, Osama bin Laden, are named as unindicted co-conspirators because American authorities believe they helped orchestrate the attack.","3386":"The failure to apprehend Osama bin Laden or to crush the Qaeda terrorist network makes Mr. Bush's mighty words seem very puny in retrospect, which ultimately proves that it is not what you say but what you do that really counts.","3387":"For that reason, officials at various embassies monitor sermons, especially those at mosques famous for scathing tirades against the West and expressions of sympathy for militants like Osama bin Laden. It is not hard to do so, since the Friday sermons are blared by loudspeakers throughout the city.","3388":"The previously undisclosed arrests, along with the deadly bombings in Morocco today and Saudi Arabia this week that bear the earmarks of Al Qaeda, provided what officials in the United States and overseas said were strong indications that Osama bin Laden's network remained a potent threat, despite setbacks like the capture in March of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the network's senior operational commander. 'Definitely, their capability has been eroded,' said one senior government official, discussing Al Qaeda's ability to carry out attacks. 'But they are still a threat, they are still sophisticated, they are still fighting and they are still trying to strike in the United States.'","3389":"DES MOINES, May 17\u2014 Democratic presidential candidates challenged President Bush today on his handling of the war on terrorism, questioning the administration's failure to find Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein and asserting that Mr. Bush had failed to protect the nation adequately against further terrorist attacks.","339":"Israeli reporters wanted to follow up on the minister's remarks earlier, when he had suggested that Osama bin Laden, the accused terrorist, was trying to infiltrate Israel, and when he urged the dismantling 15 illegal settlement outposts.","3390":"As to whether that meant Al Qaeda, the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Ben Abdallah said, 'While it would be premature to say that Al Qaeda was responsible until we have clear proof, my personal opinion is that we're talking about a network of this scope.'","3391":"The comments by Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz were the strongest official confirmation to date that Al Qaeda, the worldwide terrorist network founded by Osama bin Laden, may have guided the attacks here. From the beginning, though, the pattern of the attacks -- with three nearly simultaneous explosions at separate locations -- was seen as a strong indication of Al Qaeda's work.","3392":"What seems to unite them is their unwillingness to criticize Mr. Hussein, who like Osama bin Laden is rapidly becoming a legend for the stealth and evasion he has apparently used in eluding capture.","3393":"Such steps would not likely dissuade Osama bin Laden, but would mean a sharp drop in recruits and sympathy for 'martyrs' in the Muslim world.","3394":"Mukhtar al-Bakri, 23, acknowledged in United States District Court here that he had attended the Al Farooq training camp along with other men from a Yemenite neighborhood in Lackawanna, a city just south of here. Mr. Bakri said that during several weeks at the camp, they received training in firearms, explosives and camouflage techniques, and also heard a speech by Osama bin Laden threatening America and Israel.","3396":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, May 21\u2014 An Arab television network broadcast an audiotape today said to have been recorded by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second most powerful figure in Al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden. It called on Muslims to attack Western interests with the same ferocity as the Sept. 11 assaults and derided Arab governments that aided the war on Iraq, even as they claimed to oppose it.","3397":"BUFFALO, May 21\u2014 A seventh man was accused today of participating in a terrorist 'sleeper' cell based in western New York by attending a Qaeda training camp run by Osama bin Laden before the Sept. 11 attacks.","3398":"In a taped message in February, Osama bin Laden, the fugitive leader of Al Qaeda, listed Morocco, with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Pakistan, as one of the 'oppressive, unjust, apostate ruling governments' that had been 'enslaved by America' and therefore 'the most eligible for liberation.'","34":"It was not clear yesterday how Ms. White and a committee of prosecutors who examined the case viewed such issues. Nor was it known whether Ms. White's office considered how a death penalty prosecution would play out in Islamic countries that the United States is seeking to enlist in the effort to arrest and bring to trial the suspected mastermind of the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden. He has been living in Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban.","340":"Prosecutors may try to draw connections between the cell of Algerians and other terrorist activities believed to be sponsored by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, who is believed to be living in Afghanistan. The United States attorney's office in Manhattan made that link in its separate case against the four men recently convicted in the conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","3400":"That successor will inherit a war on terrorism that remains unfinished, with Osama bin Laden still at large.","3401":"Investigators are focusing on whether the attackers were linked to Muslim extremist groups like the clandestine Salafia Jihadia, a homegrown group suspected of possible ties to the Qaeda terror network of Osama bin Laden.","3402":"I fear that the ruling brothers of Saudi Arabia are like the Soviet Politburo. I fear the 6,000 Saudi princes are like the Communist Party Central Committee. I fear that Riyadh is Red Square. I fear the Al-Sauds used Islamism to unite 40 fractious tribes in Arabia the way Lenin used Communism to unite 100 fractious nationalities across Russia. And I fear that Osama bin Laden is just the evil version of Andrei Sakharov -- the dissident Soviet scientist who exposed the system from within. Sakharov was exiled to Gorky. Bin Laden was exiled to Kabul. And both systems meet their end where? In Afghanistan.","3404":"This is what has happened consistently during America's struggle with Osama bin Laden. During the years when Al Qaeda's terrorists were gearing up for 9/11, the media giants were in overdrive selling escapist fare like the Clinton scandals, Gary Condit's sex life and shark attacks. They were all legitimate stories. But just as 'The Matrix Reloaded,' playing on a record 8,517 screens, crowded most other movies out of the marketplace last weekend, so those entertaining melodramas drove any reports of threatening developments beyond our shores to the periphery of the mass-media news culture.","3405":"Only people who don't watch '60 Minutes,' don't read the newspapers, seek to remain oblivious of the activities of the House Government Operations Committee, ignore the Most Wanted posters in their local post offices or live in a cave are unaware of the story of James J. Bulger, known as Whitey, once the underworld boss of Boston. Today, Whitey is found in the second row of the F.B.I.'s most wanted (only Osama bin Laden hangs above him) and a regular on 'Unsolved Mysteries' and 'America's Most Wanted.' He is sought in connection with numerous murders and for a lifetime of racketeering.","3406":"American credibility in the region has also been sapped, Arab diplomats say, by the failure to find Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden or any unconventional weapons in Iraq -- the rationale the administration presented for war.","3407":"But members of the staff who were excited that their paper had been so central to the debate over extremism were deflated by the firing of Mr. Khashoggi, who was educated at Indiana State University and spent almost eight years covering Osama bin Laden and extremist Islamic movements for Al Hayat, an Arabic newspaper in London. He was appointed editor in chief in March.","3408":"Yet, there have been significant failures of our defense establishment: we have not been successful in finding Iraqi 'weapons of mass destruction,' nor have we been able to locate and capture Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein.","3409":"One defendant in the Bali case, Ali Ghufron -- better known as Mukhlas, and considered to be the operations chief of Jemaah Islamiyah -- said he knew Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's founder, well. He denied that Mr. bin Laden was involved in the blast at a Bali nightclub last October.","341":"'I read that you said that you would not let Osama bin Laden dictate to the U.S.,' Sharon told Bush, and then made the point he came to the White House to press home: 'Everyone has his bin Laden. Arafat is our bin Laden.'","3410":"In the mid-1990's, when he was looking for places to train recruits outside Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden sent an emissary to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which controlled territory and already had a military training course for its own purposes.","3412":"The only people who use violence are rogues or nonstate actors with no stakes in the system, such as Osama bin Laden. Basically, he is in a civil war with the Saudi ruling family. But, he says to himself, 'The Saudi rulers are insignificant. To destroy them you have to hit the hegemonic power that props them up -- America.'","3413":"As reassured Iraqi technicians and nurses come forward and as Baathist war criminals seek to save their skins, we will learn much more about Saddam's terrorist connections and his weaponry. It took seven years to catch the Olympic bombing suspect in North Carolina and 18 years to catch the Unabomber; the location of Saddam and Osama bin Laden won't remain a mystery forever.","3414":"The appeals court showdown is the latest twist in the tortured, 17-month prosecution of Mr. Moussaoui, a confessed Qaeda member who has repeatedly expressed his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, even as he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.","3415":"The exchange was the latest spark in a case that has long captivated the state and that involves two brothers who chose starkly different paths out of one of Boston's toughest neighborhoods. William Bulger, 69, became the Greek- and Latin-quoting president of the State Senate, a position he held for 17 years. Whitey Bulger is charged with 21 murders and sits below Osama bin Laden on the F.B.I. list of 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.","3416":"While acknowledging that he is loyal to Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network, Mr. Moussaoui has pleaded not guilty, arguing that testimony from captured members of Al Qaeda would support his assertion that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 conspiracy. He has said he was part of another terrorist operation that was set to occur outside the United States after Sept. 11.","3417":"Other terror cases have been more high profile, though the Detroit case is the first to result in a courtroom trial. Zacarias Moussaoui is still awaiting trial as a conspirator in the Sept. 11 attacks. The so-called shoe bomber, Richard Reid, was sentenced to life in prison in January after pleading guilty to trying to set off an explosive in his shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight. Six Yemeni men in the Buffalo suburb of Lackawanna have also pleaded guilty to terror charges; the men were said to be part of a terror cell. Some of the men trained at a camp run by Al Qaeda and even met with Osama bin Laden. The government last month accused a seventh man of being part of the cell.","3418":"His story, told while he sat under a white and yellow striped awning on the back terrace of his home, concerns not just survival but also the hijackers themselves, whom he deeply believes were not Islamic extremists of the Osama bin Laden type, with a casual disregard for the lives of others.","3419":"Dislike of the United States has spread in the Muslim world. Majorities in seven out of eight predominantly Muslim nations expressed a worry that their countries might be threatened by the United States. They voiced concern that Islam itself was in jeopardy, and large majorities in Indonesia, Jordan and the areas administered by the Palestinian Authority expressed at least some confidence in Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","342":"During cross-examination, a prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, raised questions about the genuineness of Mr. Mohamed's remorse and the depth of Dr. Post's knowledge about the group led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","3420":"While he admits that he is a member of the Al Qaeda network and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, Mr. Moussaoui insists that he had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks and that the testimony from Mr. bin al-Shibh would help prove that.","3421":"'Saddam has escaped,' he proclaimed. 'He will be free all the time, like Osama bin Laden.' As he spoke, other Iraqi men in the room nodded.","3422":"Abu Zubaydah, a Qaeda planner and recruiter until his capture in March 2002, told his questioners last year that the idea of working with Mr. Hussein's government had been discussed among Qaeda leaders, but that Osama bin Laden had rejected such proposals, according to an official who has read the Central Intelligence Agency's classified report on the interrogation.","3423":"Mr. Nuss, a longtime pie-plant worker who lived alone, was said to be agitated by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He told the students he was going to show them that he was against Osama bin Laden, the authorities said.","3424":"Why shouldn't Israel hunt Dr. Rantisi down, just as the United States hunts down Osama bin Laden and other terrorists?","3425":"The alert was issued in May after the suspect, Fazul Abdullah Muhammad, was sighted in Mombasa. Investigators say he has been an associate of Osama bin Laden since the early 1990's and is the leader of Al Qaeda's operations in East Africa.","3426":"What the Bush administration did was gild the lily -- disseminating information that ranged from selective to preposterous. The president himself gave credence to the claim that Iraq was trying to buy uranium in Africa, a story that (as Seymour Hersh's investigations leave little doubt) was based on transparently fraudulent information. Colin Powell in his February performance at the U.N. insisted that those famous aluminum tubes Iraq bought were intended for bomb-making, although the technical experts at the Department of Energy had made an awfully strong case that the tubes were for conventional rocket launchers. And as James Risen disclosed in The Times this week, two top Qaeda planners in custody told American interrogators -- one of them well before the war was set in motion -- that Osama bin Laden had rejected the idea of working with Saddam. That inconclusive but potent evidence was kept quiet in the administration's zeal to establish a meaningful Iraqi connection to the fanatical war on America.","3427":"Israel's supporters argue that if America can go after Osama bin Laden, Israel can go after Hamas. Of course Israel is entitled to pursue its mortal enemies, just as America does, but it cannot do it with reckless abandon, notes Mr. Ezrahi, for one reason: America will never have to live with Mr. bin Laden's children. They are far away and always will be. Israel will have to live with the Palestinians, after the war. They are right next door and always will be.","3428":"In a separate operation on Thursday near the northern city of Kirkuk, the 173rd Airborne Brigade detained 74 'suspected sympathizers' of Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden. There were no further details about the operation, or explanation for the basis of the suspicions about those arrested.","3429":"Chief Bratton, who plays politics by a less genteel set of rules than Mr. Hahn, infuriated the Council by suggesting it was jeopardizing the safety of the citizenry and leaving police officers vulnerable by not supporting the hiring plan. He said that by its actions the Council was inviting Osama bin Laden to attack Los Angeles and putting police officers at the mercy of armed gangs.","343":"'It will hurt me; he is my son,' said Hideya Rubeya Juma, the mother of Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, who was convicted last month on 11 counts of murder in the attack in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and also of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a plot to kill Americans around the world.","3430":"Prosecutors said Mr. Faris traveled in Afghanistan and Pakistan beginning in 2000, meeting with Osama bin Laden and working with one of his top lieutenants, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, to help organize and finance jihad causes. After returning to the United States in late 2002, officials said, he began casing the Brooklyn Bridge and discussing via coded messages with Qaeda leaders ways of using blowtorches to sever the suspension cables.","3432":"The questioning of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden who was captured in March in Pakistan, provided what law officials said was critical information that linked Mr. Faris to Al Qaeda.","3433":"Iyman Faris, a naturalized American citizen from Columbus, Ohio, pleaded guilty in closed proceedings last month to charges he provided support to terrorists. Prosecutors said that since 2000 he had been traveling to Afghanistan and Pakistan and communicating with Al Qaeda operatives, and that he had met with Osama bin Laden. As recently as March he was sending coded messages back to them, officials said. One of the last ones warned it was 'too hot' -- presumably a warning that any attempt to destroy the bridge was likely to fail.","3434":"The officials said they had not yet assessed the accuracy of his claims. But Mr. Hussein and his two sons join Osama bin Laden as the figures whose capture (or corpses) the White House would most like to display. Douglas Jehl","3435":"'There might be people crossing their fingers, but it's just like a year ago, when they were crossing their fingers' in the hopes of capturing Osama bin Laden, one military official said. Mr. bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, is still believed to be alive after 21 months in which he has been the target of an intense manhunt.","3436":"The police have apologized to the Royal Family after admitting that a man dressed in an Osama bin Laden costume had managed to scale a wall at Windsor Castle and talk his way past security guards at Prince William's 21st birthday party on Saturday. Aaron Barschak, left, 36, a comedian known for gate-crashing celebrity events, was arrested after he climbed onto the stage where William was making a speech thanking his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, for the party. The Scotland Yard commissioner, Sir John Stevens, described the incident as an 'appalling' breach of security, and Home Secretary David Blunkett, signaling the government's concern, said he would make a public statement in the House of Commons today. Warren Hoge (NYT)","3437":"The officials said people in American custody indicated that Mr. Marri had visited a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, met with Osama bin Laden and pledged support for Al Qaeda's cause. He was assigned to help 'settle' operatives for follow-up attacks after Sept. 11, officials said.","3438":"Sudan was a base for Osama bin Laden in the early 1990's and has been accused by American government officials of sponsoring terrorism, although it has made efforts recently to show that it does not.","3439":"In recent interviews General Musharraf has said that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive and hiding either in Pakistan's tribal areas close to the Afghan border or inside Afghanistan.","344":"The defendant, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, sat quietly in court as his fate was being debated. Mr. Mohamed was convicted on May 29 of bombing the American Embassy in Tanzania, which killed 11 people, and of conspiring in a terrorism plot with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. The jury must now consider whether Mr. Mohamed should be put to death.","3440":"Mr. Abdullah, who was arrested in April last year, lived in Afghanistan from 1999 to 2001 and provided the German police with a detailed picture of the training camps run by Osama bin Laden and Mr. Zarqawi. Among the seven people arrested along with Mr. Abdullah, four are still in custody and awaiting trial, including the suspected leader of the cell, Muhammad Abu Dhess. Mr. Abdullah has incriminated members of this group, and has also given the police information on other suspected Qaeda operatives, including Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th Sept. 11 hijacker, who is awaiting trial on federal conspiracy charges in Alexandria, Va. Desmond Butler (NYT)","3441":"General Musharraf said today that the search for Osama bin Laden continues. Asked if Mr. bin Laden was in the tribal areas of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan, the general said 'your guess, sir, is as good as mine.' More than a year ago, General Musharraf said during a visit to the White House that he believed Mr. bin Laden was probably dead.","3442":"Officials said recent information from Qaeda operatives in American custody, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, pointed to Mr. Marri as a 'sleeper' operative assigned to help other members of Al Qaeda 'settle' in the United States. Mr. Marri visited a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and met with Osama bin Laden, officials said.","3443":"The report also deplores that the United Nations list of Al Qaeda operatives and associates of Osama bin Laden is relatively short, a problem it attributes to the unwillingness or inability of some countries to provide names to the monitoring group. Most of the names so far, officials here said, have come from the United States.","3444":"Poor Bill Clinton. He's trying to deal with Osama bin Laden and he's got a bunch of angry women on his case, and a sex-obsessed special prosecutor. He's like Ethan Frome, a guy who just wants to take a joy ride on a sled, and ends up getting stuck for life in a cramped cabin with the wife he betrayed and his now irritating and ubiquitous former dalliance.","3445":"A White Sox fan, Mike McGinnis, 54, wore a necklace made of cork and carried a 'Just Say No' sign that bore a picture of Osama bin Laden in a headdress with the Cubs' logo.","3446":"Without providing new evidence, the president also reiterated that terrorist groups continued to operate in Iraq. He pointed in particular to Ansar al-Islam, which he said was 'now active in the Sunni heartland of the country,' and to terrorists associated with Abu Masab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian identified by the United States as a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.","3447":"Intelligence officials said that the volume of 'chatter,' mainly of intercepted telephone and computer communications monitored by the government, had decreased in recent weeks, in contrast to last year when followers of Osama bin Laden were said to be discussing several possible attacks.","3448":"The $25 million reward for Mr. Hussein is the same amount offered for Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda. Mr. Bremer said up to $15 million apiece would be offered for similar information on Mr. Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay.","3449":"A series of raids over the last year disrupted the ability of the Taliban or Al Qaeda to regroup, the general said, but the operations snared only lower and middle-level fighters, 'low-hanging fruit.' The fate of Osama bin Laden is a mystery, General McNeill said, adding that in April the last piece of seemingly hard intelligence about the location of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the former Taliban leader, turned out to be bogus.","345":"An Algerian convicted of trying to carry out a terrorist attack in Los Angeles on the eve of the millennium celebration testified yesterday that he had received money and training at camps in Afghanistan that American officials say were run by Osama bin Laden.","3450":"And because it covered the Iraq war from an Arab perspective, showing everything from tapes of a gloating Osama bin Laden to Iraqi tapes of terrified American prisoners of war, many American viewers still view the network with suspicion.","3452":"In the months before the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and his advisers frequently cited classified intelligence reports that they said provided proof that Iraq was developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and had links to Osama bin Laden and other terrorists. Mr. Bush and his advisers said the threat posed by Iraq's development of those weapons and the possibility that Mr. Hussein might share them with terrorists made it necessary to overthrow the Iraqi government.","3453":"In interviews over the past several months, they said their beliefs were antithetical to everything espoused by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","3454":"Mr. Moussaoui, a French citizen who was arrested in Minnesota on immigration charges in August 2001, has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden. But he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks, a claim he has repeatedly made in handwritten court motions. Mr. Moussaoui, who is trying to act as his own lawyer, has said that Mr. bin al-Shibh has information that could prove his innocence.","3455":"While admitting that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, Mr. Moussaoui has insisted that he had nothing to do with the attacks and that Mr. bin al-Shibh could help prove his innocence.","3456":"The intruder dressed like Osama bin Laden who crashed Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle last month will face no charges, Scotland Yard said. Aaron Barschak, left, a self-styled 'comedy terrorist,' managed to elude officers of the Royal Protection Service and jump onto a stage, where he kissed the prince on both cheeks before being arrested. The commander of palace security has been removed, and nine members of his detail have been told they are under investigation. Warren Hoge (NYT)","3457":"Mr. DeLay's office succeeded in tracing the Democrats, suggesting that he might better serve Republicans in the search for Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein rather than opposition truants.","3458":"But the more restrictive Islam associated with the Taliban in Afghanistan has spread to parts of Pakistan. Anti-Americanism stirred up by the war in Afghanistan helped a coalition of militant Islamic parties win elections last year in the Peshawar region of northern Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden is rumored to be hiding in the mountains. In June legislators voted to impose Taliban-like rules, requiring all women over 12 to wear veils and banning music on public transportation.","3459":"The absence of such sources left counterterrorism officials largely blind to Osama bin Laden's specific intentions before the attacks and contributed to what the joint intelligence committees concluded in their report was a lack of knowledge about Al Qaeda even as the agencies for years collected information that showed the terror network hoped to strike inside United States.","3460":"Mr. Youssef is currently assigned at F.B.I. headquarters as the supervisor of a unit that has been translating hundreds of thousands of documents seized from Osama bin Laden's training camps and elsewhere in Afghanistan -- a job that Mr. Youssef said undervalued his knowledge and experience as a Middle East counterterrorism expert.","3461":"The best chance at killing or capture may have been deep in the past. Below the white peaks of the Spin Ghar near the Pakistani line, Osama bin Laden was spotted, in late November and early December 2001, along with at least 1,000 of his Qaeda fighters. The American high command believed this was it but didn't want to put its soldiers -- even Delta Force, renowned for risk-taking -- in severe danger; didn't want British special forces -- who also had teams in the area, eager to move in -- to claim the war's greatest prize; and couldn't compel Pakistan to close off the frontier. (Why the Americans didn't block the frontier themselves has never become clear, though the perils of landing helicopters at high altitudes in terrible weather probably played a part.) Without much support on the ground, with only the troops of Afghan warlords to rely on, a bombardment from American jets merely chased bin Laden between the ridges, most think, and across the border. He may well have bought the warlords off and been allowed to escape. He may well have had the help of the region's Pashtuns, the ethnic group most loyal to his Taliban collaborators. Months later, Canadian coalition soldiers dug up bodies from a cluster of graves that had become a local shrine, bodies from December's bombing. The hope was that one would be bin Laden's. None were.","3462":"In making its case for war, the administration dismissed the arguments of experts who noted that despite some contacts between Baghdad and Osama bin Laden's followers over the years, there was no strong evidence of a substantive relationship. As members of the National Security Council staff from 1994 to 1999, we closely examined nearly a decade's worth of intelligence and we became convinced, like many of our colleagues in the intelligence community, that the religious radicals of Al Qaeda and the secularists of Baathist Iraq simply did not trust one another or share sufficiently compelling interests to work together.","3463":"Amazon is calling its program Look Inside the Book II, the publishers said. It would expand on a current program that lets shoppers read a table of contents, a first chapter or a few selected pages provided by the publishers of certain books. But Look Inside the Book II would let online browsers search by terms like 'Caravaggio,' 'sans-culottes,' or 'Osama bin Laden,' and then see a list of books mentioning the term along with the sentence that contains it. Browsers could then choose to see several pages around that citation.","3465":"Well, if we're going to talk about aiding the enemy: By cooking intelligence to promote a war that wasn't urgent, the administration has squandered our military strength. This provides a lot of aid and comfort to Osama bin Laden -- who really did attack America -- and Kim Jong Il -- who really is building nukes.","3466":"That Saddam Hussein and his sons somehow managed to escape Baghdad and elude American searchers for so long has been one of the war's many surprises. Washington's inability to find some of its most prominent enemies -- Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and Saddam Hussein -- has been frustrating for all Americans. The capture of Mr. Hussein would be especially helpful in pacifying Iraq.","3467":"We must never forget our real enemy, who orchestrated the attack on our country. Osama bin Laden is still at large. He is the real threat to the safety and security of our country.","3468":"The report was described as a scathing critique of the two agencies in the months before the attacks, saying they failed to counter the threat from Al Qaeda even though they had known for years that its leader, Osama bin Laden, was determined to attack the United States. Parts of the report have been disclosed by various news organizations in the past week.","347":"Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian convicted of trying to carry out a terrorist attack in the United States on the eve of the millennium, testified that he got money and training at camps in Afghanistan that American officials say were run by Osama bin Laden. Mr. Ressam testified in federal court in Manhattan at the trial of Mokhtar Haouari, another Algerian accused of providing money and support to blow up the Los Angeles airport. A1","3470":"Typical of the missteps was the handling of a memorandum sent by an F.B.I. agent to Phoenix in a memorandum to headquarters in July 2001, outlining concerns about the possibility that Osama bin Laden had started a coordinated effort to send operatives to the United States for flight school training. The agent noted an 'inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest' taking such training in Arizona and recommended that the F.B.I. compile a list of civil flight schools, discuss the concerns with other intelligence agencies, and consider seeking authority to obtain visa information on flight students.","3472":"WASHINGTON\u2014 IN last week's congressional report on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency came under sharp criticism for failing to respond to repeated warnings that Osama bin Laden's terror network intended to strike inside the United States. In fact, the nearly 900-page report, prepared by a joint panel of House and Senate intelligence committees, outlined the intelligence lapses at great length, emphasizing the volume, clarity and magnitude of warnings gathered over months and even years.","3473":"Back in the mid-1990's there was a lot of talk about 'a new Middle East' that seemed to be aborning. It turned out to be, shall we say, 'premature' -- as the newest new Middle East came crashing down with the collapse of Oslo, the breakdown in Arab-Israeli relations, 9/11 and the massive passive support for Osama bin Laden. With hindsight, it's now easy to see that there could be no 'new Middle East' without a new kind of Middle East politics. It was like trying to build a new house on swampland. Eventually, it just sank.","3474":"If the federal authorities were alert enough to find enough evidence to indict Martha Stewart, why would one think that Osama bin Laden would be able to avoid detection?","3475":"The United States was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. But instead of using all the means available to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the Bush administration became obsessed with the ouster of Saddam Hussein and the takeover of Iraq.","3476":"Little of the outside world reaches Prampram. My students asked about my eyeglasses, the purpose of which eluded them. When I showed them a book of New York photographs, they had trouble understanding that people lived on each floor of the tall buildings. The World Trade Center produced a glimmer of recognition. The students wanted to know why it had been attacked, and whether the attackers had been caught. One student had heard that Osama bin Laden was angry because America had reneged on a promise to pay him money.","3477":"The senior American and Middle Eastern officials who identified Mr. Adel as being among those in Iranian custody spoke on condition of anonymity. They said their governments had strong evidence that Mr. Adel was detained in Iran several weeks ago. They also said they believed that other Qaeda figures in Iranian hands included Saad bin Laden, one of Osama bin Laden's older sons, and Suleiman Abu Geith, a Qaeda spokesman.","3478":"Parallels between the Lafferty brothers and Islamic terrorists aren't obvious, and Krakauer doesn't explore them very explicitly. The author of 'Into Thin Air,' the best-selling account of death on Mount Everest, he is essentially a narrative writer. He mentions Osama bin Laden near the beginning and end of the book and leaves it for readers to draw their own conclusions, with some help from the book jacket's reference to 'Taliban-like theocracies in the American heartland.'","3479":"LONDON, Sunday, Aug. 3\u2014 An audiotape said to be by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second most powerful figure in Al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden, warned the United States today that it would pay a high price if it harmed any of the detainees it is holding at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba.","348":"But the trial is receiving widespread attention not because of Mr. Haouari's alleged role, but because of Mr. Ressam's appearance. After he was convicted in April of participating in an act of international terrorism, he broke a long silence and agreed to cooperate with the government. Mr. Ressam is one of the few Islamic terrorists to publicly disclose details about camps in Afghanistan that United States officials say are run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has financed terrorist plots around the world, or about plans made by the camps' graduates. He is also among the few to be caught on American soil.","3480":"If that bet was not to your taste, there were plenty of others available. Would weapons of mass destruction be found in Iraq by the end of September? Would Saddam Hussein be captured? How about Osama bin Laden? Would the terrorism alert level in the United States be raised or lowered? Will Kobe Bryant be convicted?","3481":"For Gaylin, hatred is a pathological state. Perhaps. But I feel a deep hatred for Osama bin Laden and am willing to call him evil, even knowing that he would use the same designation for me. I am not obsessed with rage, but I think about him hatefully at least once a day, and I would like to see him captured, humiliated and condemned to a long, undignified life. I imagine much worse fates for him, but I could not carry out or even order these fantasy-schemes. This at least separates me from the men of Jedwabne. Yet if one of my children had died on 9/11, I could perhaps do almost anything to bin Laden; one cannot know unless one is there. Still, I harbor real hatred and I don't see it as pathological. Indeed, contra Gaylin, hatred can be adaptive, especially in a creature with long memory; in hunter-gatherer life, it may have been essential.","3482":"The victims said they told the men, 'Relax, relax,' and explained that they were Indian immigrants from Punjab with no connections to Osama bin Laden or to the Taliban who sheltered him in Afghanistan.","3483":"Mr. Ricco said that he believed that information provided to the authorities by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a senior aide to Osama bin Laden, led to the arrest of his client.","3484":"EDINBURGH: CRASHING A PARTY CRASHER -- Aaron Barschak, the prankster who entered Prince William's 21st birthday party in June dressed as Osama bin Laden, has gotten a taste of his own medicine. Mr. Barschak's show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, 'Osama Like It Hot,' was interrupted on Monday by a rival comedian dressed as Saddam Hussein, with six members of an ad hoc Comedy Alliance, The Guardian of London reports. Mr. Barschak, whose show has been panned by critics, asked his attackers, 'Have the press sent you?'","3485":"The Jakarta bombing also came days after an Arab satellite television station broadcast a taped audio message threatening violence against the United States. Intelligence analysts in Washington attributed the tape to Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's chief deputy. The message followed news accounts suggesting that detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay might be tried and sentenced to death. It said, 'Crusader America will pay dearly for any harm done to any of the Muslim prisoners it is holding.'","3486":"The Taliban are resurgent in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden is still at large, Al Qaeda is still planning and carrying out attacks, and yet Congress is underfinancing the Department of Homeland Security. Meanwhile, the Bush administration is spending almost $1 billion a week in Iraq, whose weapons of mass destruction have yet to be found and whose link to 9/11 and terrorism appears to be nonexistent.","3487":"'Paracha was advised not to ask any questions about the money,' the complaint says, because the Qaeda associate was a supporter of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Paracha, who was interviewed by American investigators, said he 'believed the funds to be Al Qaeda money,' and that the Qaeda associate 'wanted to keep the funds liquid and to be able to retrieve them on short notice.'","3488":"DETROIT, Aug. 8\u2014 Federal officials have asked an immigration judge here to close the deportation hearing of a Syrian, Nabil al-Marabh, once suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden.","3489":"Mr. Moussaoui, a Frenchman, has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden. But he has denied involvement in any plot against the White House and has pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired in the Sept. 11 attacks. He was arrested in August 2001 on immigration charges after having aroused the suspicion of his instructors at a flight school in Eagan, Minn.","3490":"Ladies and gentlemen, I have no idea whether these are the only two liberal Shiite clerics in Iraq. People tell me they definitely are not. Either way, their willingness to express their ideas publicly is hugely important. It is, for my money, the most important reason we fought this war: If the West is going to avoid a war of armies with Islam, there has to be a war of ideas within Islam. The progressives have to take on both the religious totalitarians, like Osama bin Laden, and the secular totalitarians who exploit Islam as a cover, like Saddam Hussein. We cannot defeat their extremists, only they can. This war of ideas needs two things: a secure space for people to tell the truth and people with the courage to tell it. That's what these two young clerics represent, at least in potential.","3491":"The book's subtitle, unfortunately, suggests a less persuasive argument. 'It is not far-fetched,' Kinzer writes, 'to draw a line from Operation Ajax through the shah's repressive regime and the Islamic revolution to the fireballs that engulfed the World Trade Center in New York.' Kinzer is right to warn against the unintended consequences of American intervention, but his suggestion here involves far too many causal leaps. After all, the shah needn't have turned out to be such a tyrannical disaster, and 1953 needn't have led to 1979. Moreover, while Iran's Shiite radicals surely helped inspire many Sunni Arab Islamists, the Iranian revolution hardly created the fanaticism of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, who nursed hatreds of their own. Indeed, revolutionary Iran and Taliban Afghanistan were rivals, not allies, and they even almost went to war in 1998.","3492":"The official said Saudi authorities believe that 10 to 15 high-ranking Qaeda operatives were in Iran, among them Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian. He said Saudi Arabia was also seeking the return from Iran of several Saudi citizens connected to Al Qaeda, among them Saad bin Laden, one of Osama bin Laden's sons, who was said to have been groomed to take over the operational and financial reins of the terror network.","3493":"Saudi Arabia has conducted a series of raids in recent months against groups of militants suspected of having links to the Saudi-born Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network since suicide bombings killed 35 people -- including nine Americans -- in Riyadh in May.","3494":"In an interview last week, Mr. Ricco said that the elder Mr. Paracha was a prominent political activist in Pakistan who has traveled to Afghanistan in the past and 'has even met Osama bin Laden.'","3495":"In an earlier meeting in New Jersey, on Jan. 17, 2002, Mr. Lakhani and the buyer discussed Osama bin Laden. According to the affidavit, Mr. Lakhani said Mr. bin Laden had 'straightened them out' and had done 'a good thing.'","3496":"British officials said the Army and undercover agents might be called on to protect the Royal Family after an inquiry highlighted a series of security lapses by the police at a 21st birthday party for Prince William at Windsor Castle in June. The report said an intruder, Aaron Barschak, dressed up as Osama bin Laden, set off seven alarms and was seen on closed-circuit television five times before the police realized he had not been invited to the party. Mr. Barschak even entered a room where virtually the entire Royal Family was having dinner, the report said. Alan Cowell (NYT)","3497":"WASHINGTON, Aug. 14\u2014 A top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden who the authorities said was the mastermind of the deadly Bali bombings in October 2002 and the attack last week on the J. W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta has been captured in Southeast Asia, a White House spokesman said today.","3498":"The White House reported that an Indonesian follower of Osama bin Laden who is thought to be the mastermind of the Bali bombings had been captured.

He doesn't have the name recognition of an Osama bin Laden, but this guy was a big deal.'","35":"The latest 10 include Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi Arabian suspected of masterminding the deadly 1998 bombings of two United States embassies in Africa; Eric Rudolph, who is suspected of six bombings, including fatal ones at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala.; and Agustin Vasquez-Mendoza, charged in the 1994 murder of an undercover anti-drug agent.","3502":"Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer representing the younger Mr. Paracha in New York, has said the elder Mr. Paracha met Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.

Even before the coalition troops invaded, a senior United States counterterrorism official told reporters that 'an American invasion of Iraq is already being used as a recruitment tool by Al Qaeda and other groups.' Intelligence officials in the United States, Europe and Africa say that the recruits they are seeing now are younger than in the past. Television images of American soldiers and tanks in Baghdad are deeply humiliating to Muslims, even those who didn't like Saddam Hussein, explained Saad al-Faqih, head of Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, a Saudi dissident group in London. He told me that some 3,000 young Saudis have entered Iraq in recent months, and called the war 'a gift to Osama bin Laden.'","3505":"Osama bin Laden was inspired to attack us partly by his hatred of the American military presence in Saudi Arabia. Now foreign zealots from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria, enraged about the American military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, are slipping over the Iraqi border to help Saddam loyalists.","3506":"'Definitely, this is the work of Al Qaeda,' said Dia Rashwan, an expert on radical Islam at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. 'Osama bin Laden believes that the U.N. is a mere tool to legitimatize the atrocities committed by big countries like the United States.'","3507":"Osama bin Laden and his ilk condemned Saddam Hussein, whose secular world was in conflict with the Islamic fundamentalist dogmas.","3508":"Most of the individuals whose movements and communications are being closely tracked are believed to be sympathizers of Osama bin Laden who may be engaged in low-level support activities for the Qaeda terror network, like raising money, relaying messages and recruiting new members, American and European officials said. The officials insisted that no evidence had emerged that any of the suspects were preparing an attack or posed any imminent threat.","3510":"Mr. Bashir has denied he engaged in terrorism, but he has expressed unabashed admiration for Osama bin Laden. He accused the United States and other 'infidels' of pushing the Indonesian government to file the charges against him.","3511":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 3\u2014 Top White House officials personally approved the evacuation of dozens of influential Saudis, including relatives of Osama bin Laden, from the United States in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks when most flights were still grounded, a former White House adviser said today.","3512":"White House officials approved the evacuation of dozens of influential Saudis, including relatives of Osama bin Laden, from the United States in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, a former aide said.

But Mr. Mefford said other operatives sent to the United States by Mr. Mohammed might still be at large.","3516":"Wives in these kinds of thrillers are either dead or docile. The movie version of Laura Bush (Mary Gordon Murray) is so placid and composed that she seems like the First Lady of Prozac. In real life, after the president told reporters that he wanted Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive,' Mrs. Bush famously chided him for his bravado, teasingly asking, 'Bushie, you gonna git 'im?' In the movie she merely suggests, ever so softly, that some people might misunderstand his Texan way with words.","3518":"For the first time he named that price: $87 billion for the first full year of occupation and reconstruction, of continuing his battle in Iraq and Afghanistan and his search for Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. It is a figure many experts believe may yet prove low.","3519":"In his 18-minute speech, Mr. Bush did not mention Osama bin Laden, who has so far eluded American capture in Afghanistan. He also did not mention the failure so far to find any unconventional weapons in Iraq, the major stated reason that the United States went to war. Nor did Mr. Bush dwell on the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, which he once predicted would abate if Saddam Hussein was ousted from power in Iraq. That conflict has worsened.","352":"Mr. Mohamed was also convicted with his three co-defendants of participating in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans, which prosecutors said was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, and included the embassy attacks.","3520":"Osama bin Laden told a top Qaeda operative to recruit Saudis for the September 2001 hijackings in an effort to strain relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a Saudi official said.

The collapse of 1200 B.C. seems to have been abetted by raiders who exploited shipping lanes. In the Middle Ages, the bubonic plague moved from city to city along avenues of commerce. Today a bioweapon could spread death globally the same way. And support for terrorism proliferates via the very satellites that convey stock prices, as appeals from Osama bin Laden, or images of civilian casualties in Iraq or Gaza, are beamed around the world.","3526":"Osama bin Laden and his chief lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, appeared in a videotape and an accompanying audiotape on Arab television.

A7","3534":"Not long after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Christopher Hitchens adopted the term 'Islamic fascism' to describe Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and other forms of militant Islamic fundamentalism. More recently Paul Berman, in his book 'Terror and Liberalism,' uses the fascist analogy to defend the United States invasion of Iraq, applying the term to both the regime of Saddam Hussein and various manifestations of Islamic fundamentalism.","3535":"The officials cited the new guidelines in explaining why the administration decided not to raise the alert level this week despite a pair of events that could have easily justified a heightened alert in the past: Thursday's anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks and the broadcast of a new videotape suggesting that Osama bin Laden and his chief lieutenant were alive and plotting catastrophic attacks.","3536":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u2014 THE scene was clearly intended to vex Americans. On the eve of the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, Osama bin Laden flickered across the world's television screens casually strolling down a boulder-strewn hillside. He looked calm, peaceful and, worst of all, safe.","3537":"BRIMFIELD, Mass.\u2014 Who is a martyr? In the West, 'martyr' is mainly reserved for Christian victims of Roman lions, or used facetiously for those who let others know of their self-sacrificing ways. But in the Muslim Middle East, where religious terminology permeates the culture, it seems as if almost everyone is a martyr. Realizing this is a small but crucial step in understanding a major cultural gap between the West and the Muslim Middle East, a gap that becomes more obvious with every audiotape supposedly from Osama bin Laden.","354":"Mr. Haouari is at most a small figure in the terrorist world that investigators are trying to penetrate. Intelligence officials are examining terrorist cells that formed in training camps in Afghanistan in the 1990's and fanned out around the world. They believe that many such cells are sponsored by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of running an international terror network.","3541":"Speculation has been rife in the Thai news media that the United States was offering $4 million in bounty for Mr. Isamuddin, who was captured 50 miles north of here. American officials allege that Mr. Isamuddin was part of the inner circle of Osama bin Laden and that he had a role in a number of the terrorist attacks against the United States in the past decade, including the ones on Sept. 11, 2001.","3542":"Osama bin Laden is safe in his lair; Pakistan is riven with Islamists; and Saudi Arabia is a corrupt and deeply divided state. So we took out the toothless tiger and won a great battle, to be fed an unsatisfactory peace and a more perilous future.","3544":"The authorities said Mr. Kilpatrick, of Memphis, was staying with his sister in Dyersburg, about 75 miles northeast of Memphis. In the suicide note, left at his sister's house, he also said he did not like Americans and had spoken with Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, Chief Williamson said.","3545":"He likened Osama bin Laden to a butcher who had grown inured to slaughtering animals. With terrorists, the Dalai Lama said, applying a Buddhist analysis, 'their whole mind is dominated by negative emotions.'","3546":"MADRID, Sept. 17\u2014 He has already tried to prosecute the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, as well as dozens of military officers accused of atrocities in Argentina's so-called dirty war. Now Spain's most renowned judge, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, has set his sights on Osama bin Laden.","3547":"Kenneth M. Karas, co-chief of the terrorism unit in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, was nominated yesterday by President Bush to be a federal judge in Manhattan. Mr. Karas, 39, a federal prosecutor since 1992, is a member of the team that is prosecuting Zacarias Moussaoui, accused in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Mr. Karas also helped win the 2001 convictions of four terrorists accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa. If confirmed, he would replace Judge Allen G. Schwartz, who died in March. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","3548":"Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, by releasing audio- and videotapes of themselves, have given new life to their movements of rebellion -- or at least the illusion of new life -- which, in the age of mass media, may amount to the same thing.","3549":"Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, by releasing audio- and videotapes of themselves, have given new life to their movements of rebellion -- or at least the illusion of new life, which, in the age of mass media, may amount to the same thing.

And Russia has accused the Taliban of aiding separatists in Chechnya.","3550":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sept. 18\u2014 A member of Osama bin Laden's inner circle captured in Thailand last month has provided his C.I.A. interrogators with specifics about plans by Al Qaeda to attack two American-managed hotels in Bangkok, as well as commercial airliners using the international airport there, according to intelligence officials and diplomats from several countries.","3551":"Interesting, isn't it, that America wasn't afraid to vow to capture Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.' The same holds true for Saddam Hussein. Why, then, the double standard?","3552":"Third, suicide terrorist campaigns are directed toward a strategic objective. From Lebanon to Israel to Sri Lanka to Kashmir to Chechnya, the sponsors of every campaign have been terrorist groups trying to establish or maintain political self-determination by compelling a democratic power to withdraw from the territories they claim. Even Al Qaeda fits this pattern: although Saudi Arabia is not under American military occupation per se, the initial major objective of Osama bin Laden was the expulsion of American troops from the Persian Gulf.","3553":"Today, the Governing Council issued a decree banning the two main Arab satellite networks, Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya, from 'covering the activities of the Governing Council' and other official events, accusing them of inciting violence against the new Iraqi government and its officials. Audiotapes saying they were carrying the voice of Mr. Hussein and a videotape of Osama bin Laden have been broadcast on those networks.","3555":"Prosecutors say Mr. Salim was a top aide to Osama bin Laden, and he faces separate charges of participating in a terrorism conspiracy that included the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, in which more than 200 people died. Mr. Salim stabbed Officer Pepe in the eye, leaving him with severe brain damage.","3556":"The case against Mr. Moussaoui, a French citizen who has acknowledged that he is a Qaeda member and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, has been stalled for months over the issue of whether Mr. Moussaoui and his legal advisers can have access to captured terrorist leaders who were involved in the Sept. 11 conspiracy -- and who would presumably know if Mr. Moussaoui was part of it.","3557":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 27\u2014 As United States officials try to determine what role Al Qaeda may have had in recent attacks in Iraq, investigators and Special Forces are also pursuing two men known to have had previous connections to Osama bin Laden, American officials said this week.","3558":"While it may be true that Osama bin Laden's initial objective was to expel Americans from the Persian Gulf, his ultimate goal is to establish an Islamic state and restore the caliphate.","356":"* Mr. Rumsfeld's Pentagon said yesterday that it was soon to begin building the Alaska portion of the missile shield, whether the technology works or not. Two weeks ago, in the face of threats by agents of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Rumsfeld hastily withdrew U.S. marines who were exercising in Jordan and also pulled the U.S. Fifth Fleet from its base in the Persian Gulf. Message: We will deploy weapons that don't work against an enemy that doesn't exist, and we will withdraw forces that do work against an enemy that does exist.","3560":"During the trial, Mr. Ghufron admitted to having been the operations chief of Jemaah Islamiyah, the extremist group linked to Al Qaeda that is believed responsible for the Bali bombings. He has also admitted to traveling to Afghanistan in the 1980's and fighting alongside Osama bin Laden.","3561":"Mukhlas is a veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and has bragged of meeting Osama bin Laden in 1987.","3562":"President Bush acknowledged on Sept. 17 that there was no concrete evidence that the former Iraqi dictator was involved in the terrorist attacks orchestrated by Osama bin Laden. Still, the governor has stuck closely to the same line of reasoning the White House has followed: that after the Sept. 11 attacks, tearing down any regime that aids anti-American terrorism is justified.","3564":"* In Afghanistan, the military dropped leaflets featuring the image of a clean-shaven Osama bin Laden in Western garb that read: 'The murderer and coward has abandoned you.' That the photo was so clearly doctored only enhanced the idea of America as a manipulative superpower, draining the goodwill and credibility needed for future diplomacy.","3565":"'We need to go right at him,' Mr. Kerry said. 'Remember, they thought that was their strong suit. They can't find Osama bin Laden. They can't find Saddam Hussein. They can't even find a leaker in the White House.'","3566":"Judge Brinkema said it would be unfair for the government to seek Mr. Moussaoui's execution, given its refusal to allow him to interview captured Qaeda terrorists who might provide useful testimony for his defense. In raucous court hearings last year, Mr. Moussaoui, a Frenchman, declared his loyalty to Al Qaeda and to Osama bin Laden but insisted that he had nothing to do with Sept. 11.","3567":"The Pentagon's portion of the supplemental request includes $51 billion for military operations in Iraq, $11 billion for operations in Afghanistan and $4 billion for domestic security and to support allied efforts. It covers everything from armored Humvees and protective body armor for troops to $50 million in reward bounties for capturing Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden.","3568":"The commodification of 9/11 by theater artists is perhaps even more dispiriting than that by the vendors who hawk T-shirts at ground zero. You expect more from artists. You don't expect more from the entertainment industry, but given how much hot air its players lavish on politics, its current performance is conspicuously dim. The most ambitious Hollywood effort to revisit 9/11 for its second anniversary was the Showtime docudrama, 'DC 9/11: Time of Crisis,' that injected Botox into the White House's already cosmetically enhanced version of the president's supposed derring-do while racing around the country on Air Force One. It had almost as tenuous a hold on reality as R. Kelly, the R&amp;B singer indicted on child pornography charges, who noted this year's 9/11 anniversary by declaring, 'Osama bin Laden is the only one who knows exactly what I'm going through.' Until Tuesday, the most pressing cause in show business was Arianna Huffington's farcically self-indulgent gubernatorial campaign.","3569":"'It's convenient and cheap for Osama bin Laden to transfer cash from accounts in Pakistan and southwest Asia through Dubai,' said Moyara Ruehsen, an international policy professor at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif. 'He doesn't need to use a bank if he doesn't want to.'","357":"Mr. Haouari's trial was highlighted by revelations about what came to be known as the millennium bombing plot. When the would-be bomber, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested at the border on Dec. 14, 1999, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started a sweeping search for suspects and information about the plot. Investigators later came to believe that the plot was linked to a worldwide network of terrorists orchestrated by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile.","3570":"An illustration credit on Sept. 20 with an article about the ways Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and others have used various media to keep their political movements alive referred incorrectly to the image of a gun with a videocamera attached to it. It was a composite of more than one gun; it did not show an AK-47.","3571":"Defense lawyers argued, and Judge Brinkema agreed, that the captured terrorists might offer important testimony to support Mr. Moussaoui's assertions that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Moussaoui, a French citizen who admits that he is a follower of Osama bin Laden, was arrested in August 2001.","3572":"Mr. Wilson said Mr. Bush 'certainly seems far less certain about finding the leaker than he is about finding Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein.'","3573":"They used to think their strong suit was national security. They can't find Osama bin Laden, they can't find Saddam Hussein, they can't find even find the leaker in the White House.","3574":"The basis for this charge, Posner writes, is the C.I.A.'s interrogation of one of America's biggest catches in the campaign against Al Qaeda -- a senior aide to Osama bin Laden named Abu Zubaydah, who was captured in March 2002 in western Pakistan by American and Pakistani forces. Relying on two unnamed government sources to provide new information about the intelligence gleaned from the interrogation, Posner writes that C.I.A. interrogators manipulated the injured Zubaydah's pain medication to wear down his defenses. They tricked him into believing he was in Saudi custody -- and were then shocked to hear what a relieved Zubaydah finally had to tell them. He instructed them to call a senior member of the ruling Saudi family, Posner writes, and gave them a phone number from memory. 'He will tell you what to do,' Zubaydah said. He went on to tell his interrogators that bin Laden had struck a deal in the late 1990's to gain the blessing and support of top Saudi leaders in exchange for assurances that his holy war would spare the Saudi kingdom. This testimony, an American investigator says, was 'the Rosetta stone of 9/11.' Still more intriguing, three of the Saudi leaders whom the prisoner named as allies (including Prince Ahmed bin Salman, probably best known to Americans as the owner of the Kentucky Derby winner War Emblem) wound up dead within a week of one another in three separate incidents; a Pakistani military official also named by Zubaydah was killed seven months later in a plane crash.","3575":"LACKAWANNA, N.Y.\u2014 The journey into the heart of Al Qaeda began here, in the frayed Yemeni-American neighborhood of this former steel town just south of Buffalo. For Sahim Alwan, a 28-year-old youth counselor, husband and father of young children, it led to a house in the Afghan city of Kandahar, where he came face to face with Osama bin Laden.","3576":"In contrast to the childlike wonder of the 'Little Lit' series, 'In the Shadow of No Towers' is deeply political. In an early strip Mr. Spiegelman set the tone with a drawing of himself compulsively retelling 'the calamities of September 11th to anyone who'll still listen.' He is also pictured at his drawing table, Osama bin Laden hovering over him with a bloody scimitar and President Bush aiming a revolver in his direction.","3577":"The story of the Lackawanna Six, as the young men became known, is the subject of tonight's edition of 'Frontline' on PBS. Based on joint reporting with The New York Times (which on Sunday published a 10,000-word article on the case by Matthew Purdy and Lowell Bergman), 'Frontline' takes us into the complexities of the fight against terror at home. Through interviews with top government officials, the F.B.I. agents who worked on the case and with one of the men charged, the report recounts how the Muslim Americans fell prey to a Qaeda recruiter in Lackawanna, set off for training in terrorist camps in Afghanistan, met with Osama bin Laden when he hailed martyrdom missions, and then returned home in the summer of 2001, apparently to resume their normal lives.","3578":"What's more, such reforms are the only way to deal with the two major threats that the United States faces from the dysfunctional Saudi system. The first is that Saudi society has become an important contributor to violent terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden himself is Saudi, and he has found many of his recruits among his disaffected young countrymen. And, knowingly or not, many wealthy Saudis -- including, probably, members of the royal family -- have contributed to Islamic charities that were fronts for terrorist organizations.","3579":"'Wow,' I thought, 'that must have been an interesting encounter.' Then I read the fine print. Mr. Cheney was speaking to 200 invited guests at the conservative Heritage Foundation -- and even they were not allowed to ask any questions. Great. Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein issue messages from their caves through Al Jazeera, and Mr. Cheney issues messages from his bunker through Fox. America is pushing democracy in Iraq, but our own leaders won't hold a real town hall meeting or a regular press conference.","358":"Another witness, Grace Paul, said on the tape that if Mr. Mohamed were kept alive, he might be able to help build the case against the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","3581":"Most recently, he indicted Osama bin Laden.","3582":"Do the Americans picked up in Lackawanna deserve to go to jail for their apparent interest in and quick rejection of Osama bin Laden? Does it serve society to put them behind bars? What, and whose, rights are we willing to sacrifice for the hope that we are secure?","3583":"There were reports, unconfirmed, that at least one Iraqi had been killed in the exchange of fire that erupted after American soldiers returned several hours later. Some of the celebrators chanted in support of Osama bin Laden. An audiotaped call for Iraqis to attack United States soldiers here surfaced on Saturday, and was said to be from Mr. bin Laden.","3585":"Somewhere in Pakistan Osama bin Laden must be enjoying this. The war on terror didn't have to be perceived as a war on Islam, but we seem to be doing our best to make it look that way.","3586":"Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced yesterday that the Pentagon was investigating speeches in churches by a high-ranking Defense Department official who called the war on terrorism a Christian battle against Satan and disparaged a Muslim adversary as an idol worshiper. The inquiry seems like a waste of time. Mr. Rumsfeld should remove the officer, Lt. Gen. William Boykin, as deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence, where he leads the effort to capture the people on a most-wanted list headed by Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.","3587":"A restoration of relations with Sudan would be an extraordinary development for a country that has embraced Islamic radicalism and been accused of sponsoring rebellions in neighboring countries and aiding militant groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In the 1990's, Sudan provided a haven to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","3588":"The former Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, has offered to cooperate with the government of President Hamid Karzai in a deal struck while in American custody, a senior aide to the president said. Mr. Muttawakil, regarded as a moderate who reportedly led an attempt to persuade the Taliban leaders to hand over Osama bin Laden to avert a war, has been in detention since January 2002 and made his offer in a letter. The government has not yet replied. The aide said Mr. Muttawakil was still in custody in Afghanistan. Officials have been nurturing contacts with Taliban moderates for some months in an effort to undermine an increasingly violent insurgency in southern and eastern Afghanistan and to persuade influential figures to abandon violence. Umar Daudzai, the presidential chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that a number of Taliban want to leave the fighting lines and 'want to have a normal life.' Carlotta Gall (NYT)","3589":"I know, I know, the usual suspects will roll out the usual explanations. It is, of course, Bill Clinton's fault. (Just for the record, the average rate of job creation during the whole of the Clinton administration was about 225,000 jobs a month. Mr. Clinton presided over the creation of 11 million jobs during each of his two terms.) Or maybe Osama bin Laden did it.","359":"Still, Mr. Sharon has said that, despite protests from his right, he does not intend to topple Mr. Arafat. He has even acknowledged that he made a mistake in calling Mr. Arafat names like 'murderer,' 'pathological liar' and 'bin Laden,' referring to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy. By contrast, Mr. Netanyahu said tonight that the Palestinian leader was 'much worse' than Mr. bin Laden, because 'he manufactures many more bin Ladens in the form of little children who learn how to blow themselves up in camps that the Palestinian Authority organizes.'","3590":"Chris Lehane, a strategist for the campaign of Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said that any chance his newcomer candidate could get on television was of value. Mr. Sharpton's quick wit has helped him become a star of the debates -- whether or not that will help him in Iowa and New Hampshire. He draws attention with memorable lines like this one about Osama bin Laden: 'This guy has out more videos than a rock star, but George Bush's intelligence agencies can't find him.'","3591":"'Right after 9/11, this administration determined to do bait and switch on the American public,' he said. 'President Bush said he was going to get Osama bin Laden, dead or alive. Instead, he went after Saddam Hussein. He doesn't have either one of them today.'","3592":"It would be nice to believe that this had nothing to do with the content of Mr. LoBaido's work, that he would have gotten a summons even if he had written, 'I Like Mike.' It would also be nice if Osama bin Laden turned himself in.","3593":"Prosecutors said in court pleadings that Mr. Faris traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in late 2000 and met with Osama bin Laden and other senior Qaeda leaders, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, widely regarded as a key planner of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.","3594":"'Why America Slept' closes with a riveting and disquieting account of the interrogation by American agents of the captured Al Qaeda leader and Osama bin Laden confidant Abu Zubaydah. Winning the wounded Mr. Zubaydah's cooperation by alternately giving and withholding pain medication, the agents succeeded in extracting limited amounts of information.","3595":"An article on Monday about a debate in Detroit by Democratic presidential candidates referred incorrectly to a response from Gen. Wesley K. Clark: 'Right after 9/11, this administration determined to do bait-and-switch on the American public. President Bush said he was going to get Osama bin Laden, dead or alive. Instead, he went after Saddam Hussein. He doesn't have either one of them today.' The comment responded to a question about where he stands on the war in Iraq, not to the question 'Are we to understand that what you're saying now is that those things you have said that were positive about the war was not what you meant?'","3596":"Across Europe and the Middle East, young militant Muslim men are answering a rallying cry issued by Osama bin Laden and others to join the fight against the American-led occupation in Iraq.

He argued that the Palestinian cause was completely separate from the cause of Al Qaeda.","3599":"Saudi Arabia has started a crackdown on militants loyal to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda who is believed responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks against the United States in which 15 of the 19 suicide hijackers were Saudi nationals.","36":"The effect, the lawyers say, would be to damage seriously the government's chances of prosecuting Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi exile who has been accused of leading a terrorist conspiracy that included the embassy attacks and other acts of violence against Americans abroad.","360":"The cooperation is intended to help the Greeks cope with the threat from the country's homegrown left-wing group, called November 17, as well as the potential danger from international organizations like Islamic terrorists financed by Osama bin Laden.","3600":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 6\u2014 The top American military commander for the Middle East has created a covert commando force to hunt Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and key terrorists throughout the region, according to Pentagon and military officials.","3601":"The top American military commander for the Middle East has created a covert commando force to hunt Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and major terrorists.

It said other evidence in his possession, including computer photos of Osama bin Laden, showed that his testimony was important and that ensuring his grand jury appearance by subpoena might be 'impractical.'","3604":"The president's warning of the futility of excusing dictatorship in the name of security seems custom-made for Saudi Arabia, the original home of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001. Promoting democracy there must become an urgent American priority. Washington should give itself more leverage for doing so by drastically decreasing American dependence on imported oil. The United States should also encourage the work of democracy campaigners in Egypt, Syria and Iran, providing them with educational and legal resources where appropriate and documenting and denouncing the crimes of dictatorial governments.","3605":"Earlier this year in Pakistan, after Gen. Pervez Musharraf agreed to local elections, the winners in the northwest frontier were anti-American Islamic fundamentalists who are believed to be cooperating with remnants of the Taliban to provide shelter to Osama bin Laden in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan. And how much latitude would King Abdullah or President Hosni Mubarak have to maintain relations with Israel if Jordan or Egypt were true democracies?","3607":"'The real intention of Osama bin Laden is here,' a retired senior Saudi official said. 'The intention is to throw out the government of Saudi Arabia.'","3608":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 9\u2014 For years, Osama bin Laden called for the violent overthrow of the Saudi royal family for allowing American bases in the holiest land of Islam.","3609":"He added that the latest attack should be a sign to the Saudi royal family that its country is a terrorist target, even though American forces that had been based there are now shifting to bases in other countries. Previously, Osama bin Laden had claimed that he was attacking American targets largely because the United States presence in Saudi Arabia represented a despoiling of the Islamic holy places of Mecca and Medina. But now that the Americans are withdrawing, Al Qaeda is still pursuing terrorist acts in the country, an indication that it wants to rid Saudi Arabia of its current government.","361":"Recently I wrote a memo that the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden might have written to his men, after the Bush team hastily withdrew a contingent of Marines exercising in Jordan following death threats from the bin Laden gang. One day after the column appeared in The Times and on its Web site, I received e-mails from two Marines who had been part of the exercise in Jordan. They were upset about what I had written and they e-mailed me from their ship, the U.S.S. Harpers Ferry, as it sailed away from Jordan, to scold me for suggesting that they were retreating.","3610":"The bombing of an almost entirely Arab and Muslim residential compound in Riyadh appalled Saudis far more than other terrorist attacks, evaporating much of the support on the streets for Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network. A1","3611":"America has a huge interest in the struggle for Saudi Arabia's future, and oil is only part of it. Although the latest terrorism appears directed mainly against the Saudi ruling elite, not Westerners, Al Qaeda is a sworn and deadly enemy of the United States.

One could easily do a revisionist history of 9/11 and show how it was simply the opening salvo in an attempted coup within Saudi Arabia -- with the attack on America meant only as a bank shot to undermine one of the main supports of the Saudi ruling family. Last week's Riyadh bombing was just the latest episode in this civil war, involving hard-core Islamists out to overthrow the moderate/Westernized/indulgent Saudi elite. The fact that these murderous militants have to kill innocent Saudis to draw attention suggests that they can only create mayhem, not a movement with any mass following.","3617":"Germany's highest court, the Constitutional Court, paved the way for the extradition of a Yemeni cleric to the United States on charges of financing terrorism after the United States agreed not to try him in a military tribunal, where he could receive the death penalty. American prosecutors have charged that the cleric, Sheik Muhammad Ali Hassan al-Mouyad, used a Brooklyn mosque to raise millions of dollars for Osama bin Laden. Sheik Mouyad, who was arrested in Germany in January, told an F.B.I. informant that he was Mr. bin Laden's spiritual adviser, according to a United States affidavit. A spokesman for the Justice Ministry said it would soon make a final decision on the extradition in consultation with the Foreign Ministry.","3618":"'And that includes finding those two?' the reporters asked, referring to Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden.","3619":"Judge Brinkema said in her order that recent filings by Mr. Moussaoui, who has acknowledged that he is loyal to Osama bin Laden, included 'contemptuous language that would never be tolerated from an attorney and will no longer be tolerated from this defendant.'","362":"The Council, at the urging of the United States and Russia, imposed the embargo to pressure the Taliban into surrendering Osama bin Laden, the militant who the United States says plotted the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","3620":"During his interrogations in Brooklyn, he said, he was asked about his politics. 'I had nothing to hide,' he recalled, and said he told the Americans that he supported the Palestinian cause but abhorred the tactics of Osama bin Laden. He said in the interview that he had never associated with any radicals.","3621":"The violence was a striking illustration of how volatile the situation remains in many parts of Afghanistan two years after the United States went to war to oust the Taliban government, which had given shelter to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda terrorists.","3622":"While the failure of American policy in Iraq in recent months has been painfully visible and at the forefront of public debate, the Bush administration's failures in Afghanistan have been as serious, and the risks are also great. It was Afghanistan, not Iraq, that was the spawning ground for the Sept. 11 attacks. And now, less than two years after President Bush celebrated his first military victory, Afghanistan is in danger of reverting to a deadly combination of rule by warlords and the Taliban, the allies and protectors of Osama bin Laden.","3623":"Mr. Mouyad, a cleric at a prominent mosque in Yemen's capital, Sana, is regarded as an important financier for Al Qaeda. American officials said he once boasted that he personally delivered $20 million to Osama bin Laden to support holy wars.","3624":"A symbol of the elusiveness of the Taliban and Al Qaeda is the continuing failure to capture Osama bin Laden and others who used to have free run of Afghanistan.

He met with Osama bin Laden, came to New York after 9/11, ate at a Pakistani restaurant near City Hall and scoped out the bridge for possible destruction. Again, after 9/11.","3626":"'An operational relationship between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, as detailed in the memo, would represent a threat the United States could not afford to ignore,' The Weekly Standard said in an online report on Wednesday.","3627":"Despite that cause for optimism, the intelligence officials said they are troubled by evidence suggesting that more young militant men are becoming terrorists than ever before. The men are joining groups inspired by the occupation of Iraq and the exhortations to fight by Osama bin Laden, who is seen as a hero to many disaffected Muslims.","363":"The other expenses have been for the defense of another terrorist who pleaded guilty and two defendants who are still awaiting trial in the bombings conspiracy, which prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","3631":"I fear that the kinds of security officials who pulled the plug on Mr. Powell are becoming the new priesthood of our age. If the 1990's were the era of 'Davos Man,' the 2000's are the era of 'Security Man' -- and like a priesthood, these 'terrorism experts' have unchallenged authority to curb our freedom in the name of freedom. Some of them deserve respect and know their stuff. But some wouldn't recognize the 6-foot-5 Osama bin Laden if he walked past them dribbling a basketball and dragging his dialysis machine.","3632":"What the critics say is that this loss of focus seriously damaged the campaign against terrorism. Strategic assets in limited supply, like Special Forces soldiers and Predator drone aircraft, were shifted from Afghanistan to Iraq, while intelligence resources, including translators, were shifted from the pursuit of Al Qaeda to the coming invasion. This probably allowed Qaeda members, including Osama bin Laden, to get away, and definitely helped the Taliban stage its ominous comeback. And the Iraq war has, by all accounts, done wonders for Qaeda recruiting. Is saying all this attacking the president for attacking the terrorists?","3633":"Mr. Ahdal, also known as Abu Assem al-Makky, is one of the two main leaders of Osama bin Laden's network in Yemen, according to security reports published in the Yemeni press.","3634":"Yes, it is possible that new evidence is now being or will be found to connect Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. That is proof that the administration did not have before the war. There is no doubt that the administration deluded itself and misled the public by not following standard intelligence vetting procedures, and this is what has enraged so many of us.","3635":"BRITAIN: ART PRANKSTER GOES TO JAIL -- Aaron Barschak, a British comedian known for public pranks, has called himself a 'comedy terrorist,' and now he has been punished like a criminal. Mr. Barschak was sentenced on Monday to 28 days in jail for throwing red paint over the artist Jake Chapman at a gallery in Oxford, The Independent reported. Mr. Barschak yelled 'Viva Goya' when he hurled the paint at Mr. Chapman, who has been nominated for the Turner Prize. A judge found Mr. Barschak guilty of criminal damage. Mr. Barschak found notoriety after crashing Prince William's 21st birthday party in June dressed as Osama bin Laden. For that stunt, he scaled a wall before climbing onto a stage where Prince William was giving a speech. He managed to kiss the prince on both cheeks before being arrested, but was not charged.","3636":"Shahdi Abdellah, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin convicted of helping to plan attacks against Jewish targets in Germany, received a lenient four-year prison sentence after providing information into his radical Islamic group and its links to Al Qaeda. Mr. Abdellah, 27, who has said that he was once was a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, told the authorities that Islamic extremists in a group called Al Tawhid were planning attacks on Jewish targets in D\u00fcsseldorf and on the Jewish Museum in Berlin.","3637":"The sad fact is that we have taken Osama bin Laden's bait. While Al Qaeda may be on the run, the number of terrorists -- as well as their innocent victims -- is tragically increasing. Regardless of whether Operation Iraqi Freedom was actually part of Osama bin Laden's strategy, the United States certainly seems to be playing into his hands.","3638":"The title of John Keegan's anecdotal and often cursory new book 'Intelligence in War: Knowledge of the Enemy From Napoleon to Al-Qaeda' is highly misleading. It suggests that the renowned military historian -- the author of such classic studies as 'The Face of Battle' and 'The Mask of Command' -- will provide a wide-ranging assessment of the role that intelligence has played in modern warfare and address such timely intelligence matters as, say, the failure to prevent the terrorist attacks of 9/11 or the failures to locate Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.","364":"Four suspected followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy, were convicted this year in federal court in New York of carrying out the nearly simultaneous bombings of the American Embassies here and in Tanzania.","3640":"As I walked around the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, looking at the finalists in the competition held by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, it was hard to feel any connection to the grotesque evil that had crashed into innocence right outside these windows two years ago, the evil that still radiates from that huge pit and makes you mutter imprecations against Osama bin Laden.","3641":"Thomas L. Friedman is the latest to admonish antiwar protesters for not directing their ire at Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein (column, Nov. 30). They are not our government representatives. It is George W. Bush and Tony Blair who act in our name and whose actions thus demand our public response.","3642":"Reliable information about the investigation into the bombings has been spotty because of a government ban. Turkish news reports on the case are based on leaked information, some of which has already proved inaccurate. The whereabouts of Dr. Zawahiri, an Egyptian-born surgeon who merged his own militant force with that of Osama bin Laden in 1998, have been uncertain since late in 2001 when he was in Afghanistan.","3643":"Mr. Reid was sentenced to life in prison for a Dec. 22, 2001, bombing attempt aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight. When he pleaded guilty in October 2002, Mr. Reid said he was a member of Al Qaeda, pledged his support to Osama bin Laden and declared himself an enemy of the United States.","3644":"Mr. Moussaoui is a French citizen who readily acknowledges his membership in Al Qaeda and his loyalty to Osama bin Laden but denies guilt in the Sept. 11 attacks and says testimony from captured terrorists would demonstrate his innocence. His lawyers have argued that he is entitled to that testimony under the Sixth Amendment, which grants defendants a right to seek out witnesses who might bolster their case.","3645":"In pleading guilty this year to supporting a terrorist organization, the men said they were trained in the use of weapons and explosives and performed guard duty at the camp. They also heard speeches and watched videotapes justifying the use of suicide in the name of jihad, including two appearances by Osama bin Laden.","3646":"British officials have offered few details of the relationship between Mr. Badat and Mr. Reid, who is also a British citizen and has acknowledged his membership in Al Qaeda and his loyalty to Osama bin Laden.","3647":"Investigators in several European countries, including Italy, Germany and Britain, have focused on the participation in Iraq recruitment of a terrorist organization named Al Tawhid. The group is led by Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian who collaborated with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and has been implicated by American and European intelligence agencies in recent terror attacks in Jordan.","365":"Yet as Israelis are murdered and maimed en masse in their own country almost every day, the United States and its allies continue to fly over and drop an occasional payload on a geographically distant terrorist threat, Iraq. The United States has also vowed to pursue the elusive militant Osama bin Laden.","3650":"In my Nov. 30 column, I wrote about standing on a sidewalk in London and watching with dismay the protest parade go by -- focused entirely on Tony Blair and George Bush, with no signs or chants mentioning the atrocities perpetrated by Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein -- or even the murderous bombing in Istanbul that day. Readers wrote that at the public rally following the march, some speakers did decry the events in Istanbul. I'm glad to hear it.","3651":"BUFFALO, Dec. 9\u2014 A Lackawanna, N.Y., man who left a camp run by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan before completing training and said he had declined an offer to meet with Osama bin Laden received an eight-year prison sentence on Tuesday.","3652":"Mr. Moussaoui, who has acknowledged his membership in Al Qaeda and his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, was arrested in August 2001 after arousing the suspicion of a flight school in Eagan, Minn., where had sought pilot training for jumbo jets.","3653":"Since American forces toppled the Hussein government and the United States gained access to captured Iraqi officials and Iraqi files, the C.I.A. has not yet uncovered evidence that has altered its prewar assessment concerning the connections between Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, officials said.","3654":"He said his only link to Al Qaeda was what he called two separate and inconsequential meetings with Osama bin Laden and Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, a senior lieutenant, in Pakistan in the late 1980's, before the terrorist network was born. He denies that Ansar ever produced chemical or biological weapons, as the United States has charged.","3656":"One argument for mininukes, of five kilotons or less, is a new version of an old concept: deterrence. The old nukes built during the cold war to roast millions of Russians are probably too destructive to use before Doomsday, and our potential enemies know that. Sub-Hiroshima bombs, however, could be used on limited targets -- the suspected hideout of Osama bin Laden in the Tora Bora region a couple of years ago, say.","3657":"A group of village men sat on a log in the shade and listened intently. One's T-shirt bore the image of Tupac Shakur; another's Osama bin Laden; a third, an American slogan against drug abuse.","3658":"But the media attention Judge Garz\u00f3n is drawing has been distinctly negative since he ordered the arrest on Sept. 5 of Taysir Alony, a correspondent for Al Jazeera, the international Arabic-language television network that has attracted its own controversy by broadcasting videotapes of Osama bin Laden.","3659":"Much of the talk of the capture reminded Americans of another missing man, Osama bin Laden.","3660":"The agencies' standing was brought to a low ebb by a long line of setbacks, including the failure to anticipate the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001; the unsuccessful search for unconventional weapons in Iraq; and the inability to find Mr. Hussein or Osama bin Laden. But that string has ended in the dirt hole where Mr. Hussein was finally found, not far from his birthplace.","3661":"Congratulations and well done to our armed forces on the capture of Saddam Hussein. But why didn't we apply this same sort of effort toward the capture of Osama bin Laden, the man who started all this bloodshed? If we had done this first, would the Iraq war have been necessary?","3662":"Other Information on the Web:The New York Times has complete coverage ( http://www.nytimes.com/pages/world/worldspecial/index.html).

At the same time, a group of Democrats known informally as a 'stop Dean' coalition began running a television advertisement in New Hampshire and South Carolina that shows a photograph of Osama bin Laden with the warning, 'It's time for Democrats to start thinking about Dean's inexperience.'","3665":"American, Afghan and Pakistani officials say the search for Osama bin Laden and the fugitive leader of the Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar, is enormously different from the one for Saddam Hussein. A16","3667":"President Bush's claim that a 'dark era' is over for Iraq should remind us that the dark era for the United States will not be over until we see a similar picture of Osama bin Laden in custody.","3668":"The spot opens with a Time magazine cover featuring Osama bin Laden as synthesizer music seemingly out of a post-apocalyptic science fiction movie is heard.","3669":"Last year, Chinese officials issued a report claiming that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his terrorist network, had helped finance and train separatists in Xinjiang. China also persuaded the United States to put one group, the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, on the American terrorist list last year.","367":"An F.B.I. investigation into the deadly suicide bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen last year has virtually ground to a halt because Yemeni authorities have refused to widen the inquiry to include Islamic militant groups in Yemen. The decision has frustrated American efforts to link the bombing conclusively to Osama bin Laden. A1","3670":"Surely we wouldn't allow Afghanistan to try Mullah Muhammad Omar or Osama bin Laden.","3671":"WASHINGTON\u2014 While President Bush was careful to remind Americans that even with Saddam Hussein behind bars, 'we still face terrorists,' the White House and Pentagon have characterized the arrest as a major victory in the war on terrorism. But is Iraq really the central battleground in that struggle, or is it diverting our attention while Al Qaeda and its confederates plan for new strikes elsewhere? There's strong evidence that Osama bin Laden is using Iraq the way a magician uses smoke and mirrors.","3672":"Let's hope that this week will mark both the beginning and the end of the use of Osama bin Laden as a prop in political campaign commercials. The current TV ad starring the most infamous face in terrorism is part of a 'stop Howard Dean' movement from his fellow Democrats. Perhaps the true originators -- whose identities are as murky as Qaeda operatives' -- can be persuaded to cease and desist as a holiday present to the people of New Hampshire and South Carolina.","3673":"But in the end, he said, the advertisements were not what the union had bargained for, especially the latest one, in which an announcer questions Dr. Dean's national security qualifications as a camera zooms in on a magazine cover showing Osama bin Laden's face.","3674":"Objectives:Students will: 1. Explore what they know about the current war in Afghanistan. 2. Learn about the conditions surrounding the ongoing hunt for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammed Omar by reading and discussing the article \u201cBin Laden and Omar: Far Harder to Find.\u201d 3. In groups, investigate the physical and political geography of countries where terrorist factions are known to exist; create presentation posters evaluating conditions for eradicating any terrorist threats. 4. Individually, write a summary of their \u201cintelligence\u201d findings; compare proposed action in their assigned country to the war in Iraq.","3675":"A man who met Osama bin Laden after leaving a Qaeda training camp received a sentence of nine and one-half years in prison for helping the terrorist group. The man, Sahim Alwan, 31, was the last of six men from Lackawanna, N.Y., to be sent to federal prison. All six pleaded guilty to similar charges earlier this year. David Staba (NYT)","3676":"'To hear these guys talk, I'm against Nafta, I have an AK-47 under my pillow, I'm married to Osama bin Laden -- oh, and I'm against Israel,' he joked at a pancake breakfast on Saturday at a middle school in Clinton. 'Do not believe this nonsense.'","3677":"On Friday, the Arabic television network Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape of a statement attributed to Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chief deputy to Osama bin Laden.","3678":"During the 1980's and 90's, Pakistan, although closely allied with Washington, was virtually a rogue state. It shared nuclear bomb technology with Iran and North Korea, sponsored terrorism in Indian-ruled Kashmir and backed the Taliban government that sheltered Osama bin Laden. General Musharraf has changed some of these policies. But Washington must pressure him to do more.","3679":"Gen. Wesley K. Clark blamed 'bad leadership' by President Bush for the nation's heightened antiterrorism alert status, saying that it was a 'strategic mistake' to shift resources to Iraq from the hunt for Osama bin Laden. A20","368":"The effect of the Yemeni decision has been to frustrate efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to link the bombing conclusively to Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi, who has declared a worldwide 'holy war' on the United States.","3680":"A prominent Yemeni cleric facing federal charges that he funneled millions of dollars to Al Qaeda says he is actually an opponent of Osama bin Laden, a Yemeni diplomat said yesterday. 'Bin Laden's teaching is not in accordance with Islam' and Al Qaeda's battle in Afghanistan was 'not appropriate,' the diplomat quoted the cleric as saying.","3681":"Analysts are studying whether tapes broadcast in the Middle East in recent days carried signals to terrorists to launch attacks against the United States. In the last few days, an Arab satellite television station, Al Arabiya, has broadcast an audiotape of apparently dated material from Osama bin Laden. But another network, Al Jazeera, has broadcast portions of a fresher audiotape it said had been made by Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mr. bin Laden's deputy.","3682":"Perhaps, unconsciously, we think the war is over. The Al Qaeda network's recent bombings in Kenya and Turkey argue the opposite. Osama bin Laden's 'spider hole' has not yet been found. The muttered warnings of his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were broadcast last week, just before the government's heightened terror alert: 'We are still chasing the Americans and their allies everywhere, including their homeland.'","3683":"In a speech in Sarajevo in October, Richard C. Holbrooke, the senior Clinton administration official who negotiated the peace accords in 1995 that ended the Bosnian war, called the two men 'the Balkan version of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein,' who should have been captured years ago.","3684":"FLORENCE, S.C., Dec. 22\u2014 Gen. Wesley K. Clark on Monday blamed 'bad leadership' by President Bush for the nation's heightened antiterrorism alert status, saying that it was a 'strategic mistake' to shift resources to Iraq from the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and Afghanistan.","3685":"Howard Dean, responding in an interview published in The Concord Monitor about whether Osama bin Laden should be put to death, said, 'I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials.' Dr. Dean, a Democratic presidential contender, later released a statement saying that the bin Laden case was 'exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for.'","3686":"General Musharraf, for example, is accused by Islamic militants in Pakistan of cracking down too hard on Al Qaeda, but is suspected in Washington of looking the other way while Osama bin Laden roams freely along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Both perceptions are rooted in reality.","3687":"With a month left until New Hampshire's primary and his standing in most polls in the state a distant second to Dr. Dean, Mr. Kerry assailed him for several of his more controversial statements about Iraq and for being unclear about what should happen to Osama bin Laden.","3688":"But that kind of fatalism has Democrats fighting mad. The administration, they claim, made a strategic error in striking at Iraq instead of the roots of terrorism, and when it snubbed allies instead of working with them to track down Osama bin Laden. Everyone in the nation deserves to feel safer, they argue, much safer.","3689":"Saying afterward that he did not want his audience to consider him to be a 'lay-down Sally,' Mr. Bernier did ask some uncomfortable questions, like whether American forces would find Osama bin Laden and whether jobs would come back. But the interview's friendly tone gave Mr. Holt an opportunity to repeat campaign talking points without facing intensive journalistic follow-up questions.","369":"The Times had said the refusal essentially prevented investigators from pursuing the F.B.I. suspicion that Osama bin Laden, the Saudi militant who is the bureau's top terrorism suspect, inspired the attack, even if he did not directly organize it.","3690":"'Why, in Jordan, do people think Osama bin Laden is a better leader than George Bush?' he asked. 'It's not just Arabs who are angry with the United States. It's worldwide.'","3691":"Despite a dismal backdrop of scattered violence and postwar poverty, Afghans are trying to build a new democracy. It is a monumental struggle for this nation where the old warlords and the hard-line Taliban leaders have been regaining strength, and where Osama bin Laden may still be hiding along with other remnants of Al Qaeda. But a convention, or loya jirga, meeting behind a wall of guards in Kabul is now debating a new constitution that could give hope to this Muslim country.","3692":"'For Dean, for any front-runner, the longer the time period when there is less attention, the better,' said a senior aide to one of Dr. Dean's rivals. Of course, that has not stopped Dr. Dean's opponents from trying. Holidays or not, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Gephardt in particular have hammered Dr. Dean over a number of his controversial statements, including his suggestion that Osama bin Laden should be presumed innocent until proved guilty.","3693":"The Saudi royal government has long been the principal target of Osama bin Laden and his followers, but the extent of the Qaeda network inside the kingdom that has become evident in recent months has surprised many Saudi and American officials. American officials say analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency have warned that the crackdown might well provoke Qaeda militants in Saudi Arabia to step up their attacks, an assessment that was first reported by Knight Ridder newspapers.","3694":"Pro-Taliban elements move freely between the countries in a border region where Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the former Taliban leader, are suspected of hiding, even though the Pakistan government has handed over 500 Qaeda suspects to the United States.","3695":"In 2001, he successfully tried four defendants in connection with the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He helped lead a criminal investigation into Osama bin Laden and his terror network, Al Qaeda, which led to indictments against Mr. bin Laden, whose whereabouts are unknown.","3696":"That said, Dr. Dean has, rolling into this high-scrutiny period, made a number of statements that underscored concerns among many Democrats about how he would hold up against Mr. Bush. Most recently was a quickly retracted suggestion that he would withhold any judgment on the punishment Osama bin Laden deserved pending a determination by the judicial system.","3697":"New York remained on 'orange' alert, and there were fresh warnings of possible attacks. Unvaryingly, news broadcasts said that intelligence agencies had picked up an unusual volume of 'chatter,' a word that seemed oddly casual for a subject so dire. The locution made Osama bin Laden and his henchmen sound almost like schoolboys talking idly on the phone about how it would be way cool to blow up an American target.","3698":"Then, there is Dr. Dean's statement about a fair trial for Osama bin Laden. In our judicial system one is innocent until proved otherwise. One wonders if Senator John Kerry and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who criticized Dr. Dean's comment, care about that.","3699":"In the raid in Baghdad on Thursday that led to the arrests of the Iraqis, many of them Muslim clerics, American troops operating behind an advance party of Iraqi civil defense and police units stormed into the Ibn Taimiya mosque at midmorning, when the clerics were meeting in what they described as a religious council. The mosque is a stronghold of the Salafist school of Islam, a hard-line, back-to-basics sect that includes Osama bin Laden among its proselytizers.","37":"In 1997, Mr. Ahmed went to the embassy in Nairobi and warned C.I.A. officers about a plot to blow it up, and later told Kenyan interrogators that he was involved in the plan. The Tanzanian government has said that Mr. Ahmed acknowledged links to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is accused of masterminding the bombings.","370":"When Islamic militants chose Yemen for their most audacious attack yet on an American target, the suicide bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Aden last Oct. 12, they chose well. They killed 17 American sailors by catching the United States in a state of political denial, sending Navy ships to re-fuel in a country that the State Department had characterized only months earlier as a 'safe haven' for terrorists. Now, 10 months on, the inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been stymied. With Yemen's network of militant Islamic groups declared off-limits by Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the bureau's chances slipped further away of proving its 'working theory' -- that the Cole attack was the latest directed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian millionaire who has become an icon among Islamic militants for his 'holy war' against the United States. John F. Burns","3700":"Before that, it was Confederate flags on pickup trucks. Or a suggestion in an interview with The Concord Monitor that Osama bin Laden deserved a fair trial. (Dr. Dean quickly followed with a statement that said Mr. bin Laden deserved the death penalty.)","3701":"HE played down the capture of Saddam Hussein. He called Osama bin Laden innocent until proven guilty. And Howard Dean is still leading in the polls?","3702":"Clark is the seniormost member of a younger generation of soldiers formed not by Vietnam, though he fought there, but by the humanitarian wars of the 90's -- by Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. What makes modern war modern for Clark is not just high-tech gadgetry but both the limitations and the opportunities provided by public opinion, international law and multilateral institutions. When I asked Clark how he would have behaved differently from Bush in the aftermath of 9/11 -- we were sitting on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport beside his campaign plane -- he said, 'You could have gone to the United Nations, and you could have asked for an international criminal tribunal on Osama bin Laden,' thus formally declaring bin Laden a war criminal. 'You could then have gone to NATO and said: 'O.K., we want NATO for this phase. We want you to handle not only military, we want you to handle cutting of fund flow, we want you to handle harmonizing laws.'' NATO had, in fact, declared the terrorist attack a breach of the common defense pact, but the Bush administration had brushed it aside. Clark said that he would have made Afghanistan a Kosovo-style war.","3703":"It was disheartening to note that the name of Osama bin Laden, and the hunt for him, failed to make Secretary Powell's long list of tasks and resolutions for 2004.","3704":"The satellite channel Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape on Sunday said to be from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, in which he urged Muslims to continue fighting a holy war in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East rather than cooperate with peace efforts.","3705":"'When you were asked by The Concord Monitor about Osama bin Laden, you said you couldn't prejudge his guilt for September 11th,' Mr. Kerry said, scrunching up his face and turning incredulously to Dr. Dean. 'What in the world were you thinking?'","3706":"In Washington, President Bush welcomed the new Constitution, saying in a statement that it would 'help ensure that terror finds no further refuge' in Afghanistan. The Americans hope the new arrangements will provide a stronger government that can help Afghanistan rebuild after the war that defeated the Taliban government that had befriended Osama bin Laden.","3707":"Arab TV broadcast an audiotape said to be from Osama bin Laden urging Muslims to keep fighting a holy war in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. PAGE A11","3708":"Questions like these are all the more pressing now that we know that the main public justification for the war -- Mr. Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and the possibility that he might use them or transfer them to Al Qaeda -- has been found wanting. No chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have been found. And none of the professed links with Al Qaeda have been substantiated. As Mr. Purdum notes, top Al Qaeda leaders in United States custody have told their interrogators that Osama bin Laden and his aides considered, then rejected, linking up with Mr. Hussein. What explains this extraordinary disconnect between prewar statements and postwar reality? How much of the intelligence was wrong and why? How much were the facts exaggerated, and by whom?","3709":"Dr. Dean's choice, interestingly, had nothing to do with any of his recent, and often clarified, statements about Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and the Book of Job. Whether omitting those was a mistake, he did not say.","371":"In the first two weeks, our investigation in Yemen had gone smoothly. Our joint-operations command post was at the Aden Hotel. I had just checked in for the night when a fellow agent handed me a note that changed everything. It read in part, 'Intelligence sources have discovered an immediate and credible threat to personnel in the Aden Hotel.' In the cryptic lexicon of the intelligence community, 'immediate and credible' means 'They're coming for you -- now.' Everyone in the Middle East, from schoolchildren to Osama bin Laden, knew where we were staying. If a suicide bomber wanted to drive a truckload of explosives right up to the concierge desk, there wasn't a thing we could do about it.","3710":"The Central Intelligence Agency said the latest tape-recorded message that purports to be from Osama bin Laden was probably authentic. A10","3711":"The Central Intelligence Agency said Monday that the latest tape-recorded message that purports to be from Osama bin Laden was probably authentic.","3712":"The senior Pakistani official who discussed the genesis of the agreement said it was now clear that there were 'very, very close links between jihadis and Al Qaeda.' In September, the official noted, Osama bin Laden's deputy, Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, distributed an audiotape urging Pakistanis to overthrow General Musharraf for 'betraying' Islam.","3713":"Without any additional qualifiers, Mr. Powell continued, 'Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network, headed by Abu Musaab al-Zarqawi, an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants.'","3714":"Gen. Wesley K. Clark asserted that the federal government had not done all it could to thwart either the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or future such attacks, and that terrorism in this country was not inevitable. 'I think that it's clear that more could have been done to prevent 9/11 than was done,' General Clark said Friday, speaking to reporters in Lebanon, N.H. He was quoted in Friday's Concord Monitor as saying that 'the two greatest lies' of the last two years were that the Sept. 11 attacks could not have been prevented and that more attacks were inevitable. He said the fact that the nation's terrorist threat status had been put at 'high' over the Christmas holidays indicated that President Bush had erred in invading Iraq before Osama bin Laden was captured and his terror network dismantled. Edward Wyatt (NYT)","3715":"Now the main sense of the word has been broadened to 'that which can be acted on,' or 'act-on-able.' Some intelligence may be useful to know -- Osama bin Laden probably has a kidney ailment -- but if the C.I.A. could get his cave's address, that data would be actionable.","3716":"What is clear is that Osama bin Laden achieved his aim: 9/11 sparked real tensions between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim East. Preachers on both sides now openly denounce each other's faith. Whether these tensions explode into a real clash of civilizations will depend a great deal on whether we build bridges or dig ditches between the West and Islam in three key places -- Turkey, Iraq and Israel-Palestine.","3717":"It provides a second piece of evidence challenging the Bush administration contention of close cooperation between Mr. Hussein's government and terrorists from Al Qaeda. C.I.A. interrogators have already elicited from the top Qaeda officials in custody that, before the American-led invasion, Osama bin Laden had rejected entreaties from some of his lieutenants to work jointly with Mr. Hussein.","3718":"But much to the frustration of American officials, the two senior leaders of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and his chief lieutenant, Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, have eluded capture since the United States uprooted the Taliban from Afghanistan in 2001. Most intelligence officials say they believe that the two are hiding on the Afghan-Pakistani border.","3719":"In his stump speech, General Clark usually speaks only fleetingly of the war in Iraq or Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda. After all, he has defined himself by his opposition to the war in Iraq, and he can be relatively confident that those topics will be raised by the audiences that come to hear an anti-war general. When asked, he is highly critical of what he calls 'a world-class bait-and-switch' in which President Bush promised to get the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks but then sent the armed forces to Iraq. He suggests that the president is looking to the past, finishing up his father's war.","372":"Americans know the principle well. To cite but one example, they were convinced two decades ago that their best interests lay in supporting Islamic fundamentalists battling a Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan. The ascendancy of the Taliban, and the shelter it offers Osama bin Laden, shows how well that strategy turned out in the long run.","3720":"In the speech on Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy made the case that the administration used 'scare tactics' to persuade Congress to approve a resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, just as the hotly contested 2002 election campaigns were coming up, to distract attention from the economy and the failed effort to find Osama bin Laden.","3721":"'What we want to know is why they didn't investigate Osama bin Laden sooner,' she added.","3722":"General Clark has gained ground on Dr. Dean in New Hampshire partly on the strength of his argument that Mr. Bush's priorities were wrong and Iraq was 'a total mis-direction of U.S. resources.' He would have focused on hunting down Osama bin Laden, he said.","3724":"We should ask the would-be presidents this: Why did the Taliban regime invite Osama bin Laden to bring his terrorist organization to Afghanistan? At the time, the United States was Afghanistan's single largest contributor of humanitarian aid; harboring terrorists could only put the Taliban regime itself in harm's way. Or could it? In the end, the Taliban was emboldened by the fact that the Clinton administration never did challenge it, never forced it to pay a substantial price for harboring terrorists.","3725":"It's interesting to note that in George W. Bush's State of the Union address there was no mention of 'Osama bin Laden'; 'Mullah Omar' of the Taliban, who is still at large; 'Israel'; 'Palestine'; 'fiscal responsibility'; 'balanced' or 'balanced budget'; 'debt'; 'environment' or 'environmental'; 'Democrat' or 'Democrats' (although he did use 'bipartisan' once).","3726":"Mr. El-Hage and three co-defendants were convicted in 2001 of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa. All four terrorists received life sentences.","3727":"President Bush must be held accountable. Before 9/11, he did not do everything he could have done to keep this country safe. After 9/11, he took us to a war we didn't have to fight, and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda is still going strong. We were at terrorist condition orange.","3728":"General Clark sharply criticized Mr. Bush, saying he had failed to take adequate measures to protect the nation from the attacks on the the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 'Before 9/11, he did not do everything he could have done to keep this country safe,' General Clark said. 'After 9/11, he took us to a war we didn't have to fight, and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda is still going strong. We were at terrorist condition orange.'","3729":"Still, he added: 'We have to capture Osama bin Laden, and I think we have to destroy his terrorist network. So I don't consider that retaliating; I consider that protection.'","373":"Only three nations recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government, he reminded the group, and the United Nations has imposed economic sanctions, insisting that Afghanistan no longer play host to the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden. But, he complained, what happens when the Taliban comply with the world's difficult requests? The growing of poppy plants has been banned in Afghanistan but little has been done to provide farmers with replacement income.","3730":"But it's not at all clear that economic problems are at the root of terrorism. Many of the 9/11 hijackers were middle-class, educated individuals, and Osama bin Laden himself is a product of affluence. Many of the Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel have been young people with educations or even professions.","3731":"And Gen. Wesley K. Clark said: 'When the Bush administration came to office, the Bush administration was told the greatest threat to America is Osama bin Laden. And yet almost nine months later, when the United States was struck, there was still no plan as to what to do with Osama bin Laden.'","3732":"Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding somewhere in the area's inaccessible crags. Insurgents have used the border area, home to smugglers and guerrillas for centuries, as a base to carry out cross-border attacks that have killed or wounded dozens of American soldiers.","3733":"But what civilization, exactly, is he talking about? Since 1970, the percentage of American adults in this enduring institution has dropped from 68 to 56, the percentage of households containing married couples with kids from 45 to 26. As Mr. Bush substituted Saddam Hussein for Osama bin Laden, so he seems confused about the enemy here. Even as he gets bogged down battling gay couples who want the same civil rights as other Americans, the real culprit goes about its business. That culprit is a heterosexual culture determined to reduce marriage to a voyeuristic spectator sport as brutal and commercial as pro football but not nearly so entertaining or harmless. It says a lot about how out of touch Mr. Bush and his speechwriters are with this culture that he repeated Britney Spears's 'sanctity of marriage' language in the State of the Union only days after she had made the phrase a national joke.","3734":"That word 'mother' startled me, as if we lived in a veterinarian's world, where dogs could adopt us as part of their kingdom. Ms. Lane had touched a nerve in New York. We're still raw after 9/11. Her crazy disappearance reminds us how fragile we all are in a town that was attacked by a diabolic killer-poet, Osama bin Laden, a Mr. Blonde who hides behind a holy war. We're a city that can't quite recover from a carnage that makes no sense.","3736":"The American commander of the combined forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. David Barno, said he hoped to capture Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, this year. 'Their day has ended, and this year will decisively sound the death knell of their movements in Afghanistan,' he said. Carlotta Gall (NYT)","3737":"Mr. Isamuddin, a member of Osama bin Laden's inner circle, was captured by the Central Intelligence Agency in Thailand last August.","3738":"Mrs. bin Ladin, who was born Carmen Dufour, to an Iranian mother and a Swiss father, acquired her name through love. It happened in 1974, when she married Yeslam bin Ladin, son of one of Saudi Arabia's richest men. (She uses her husband's spelling of the family name.) Soon after, she first met her new brother-in-law, Osama bin Laden.","3739":"For this half, Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and other tyrants are cut from the same cloth of megalomania and hatred and must be stopped.","374":"If the would-be assassins were indeed Arabs, as the United Front asserted, the fact would lend credibility to those who contend that foreigners, including Osama bin Laden, are playing an ever bigger decision-making role among the Taliban.","3740":"Some of the militant groups, with roots from Southeast Asia, Central Asia and the Caucasus to North Africa and Europe, are believed to be loosely affiliated with Al Qaeda, the officials say. But other groups follow their own agenda, merely drawing inspiration from Osama bin Laden's periodic taped messages calling for attacks against the United States and its allies, the officials say.","3741":"These moral nuances fall apart in the case of virus authors who are themselves willing to release worms into the wild. They're more rare, for obvious reasons. Usually they are overseas, in countries where the police are less concerned with software crimes. One such author is Melhacker, a young man who reportedly lives in Malaysia and has expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden. Antivirus companies have linked him to the development of several worms, including one that claims to come from the 'Qaeda network.' Before the Iraq war, he told a computer magazine that he would release a virulent worm if the United States attacked Iraq -- a threat that proved hollow. When I e-mailed him, he described his favorite type of worm payload: 'Stolen information from other people.' He won't say which of his viruses he has himself spread and refuses to comment on his connection to the Qaeda worm. But in December on Indovirus.net, a discussion board for virus writers, Melhacker urged other writers to 'try to make it in the wild' and to release their viruses in cybercafes, presumably to avoid detection. He also told them to stop sending in their work to antivirus companies.","3742":"According to the American officials here, the Arabic-language document was discovered in mid-January when a Qaeda suspect was arrested in Iraq. Under interrogation, the Americans said, the suspect identified Mr. Zarqawi as the author of the document. The man arrested was carrying it on a CD to Afghanistan, the Americans said, and intended to deliver it to people they described as the 'inner circle' of Al Qaeda's leadership. That presumably refers to Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri.","3743":"These parties were used by Pakistan's intelligence service to train and support the Taliban; the Taliban themselves were at one time supported by the United States and, to the very end, by Saudi Arabia. She might also have asked her United Action Front interlocutors if they knew the whereabouts of Mullah Omar, the Taliban's mystical leader, and the man who allowed Osama bin Laden to turn Afghanistan into a base for Al Qaeda.","3744":"In the period before the war, Bush administration officials argued that Mr. Zarqawi constituted the main link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government. At the United Nations in February, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell accused Iraq of harboring 'a deadly terrorist network' headed by Mr. Zarqawi, whom he called 'an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants.'","3745":"Mr. McCormack also said intelligence officials received a tip that an associate of Osama bin Laden had discussed crashing a plane into 'large facilities' like a reactor. He added that 'sources and methods considerations did affect the language used in the speech.'","3746":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (AP) -- A group that ran an advertisement using a picture of Osama bin Laden to attack Dr. Dean was financed by donors that included labor unions and the former Democratic Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, according to a finance report the group provided Tuesday to The Associated Press.","3747":"Saddam Hussein is evil and meant us harm; that he did not have weapons of mass destruction anymore or that he is not Osama bin Laden does not give him a pass.","3748":"That Kurdish militia has for years been waging a bloody battle with Ansar al-Islam, the terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supported by Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It captured a courier carrying a message that demolishes the repeated claim of Bush critics that there was never a 'clear link' between Saddam and Osama bin Laden.","3749":"A military defense lawyer assigned to defend one of the prisoners held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay said his client was a driver for Osama bin Laden but was not guilty of any crime. A32","375":"But the most ominous pattern of mass terrorist killings in the 1990's has been traced to the Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden and his allies.","3750":"A military defense lawyer assigned to defend one of the prisoners held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, said on Wednesday that his client was a driver for Osama bin Laden but was not a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban -- or guilty of any crime.","3751":"Mr. Torricelli, who did not return calls for comment, gave $50,000 from his Senate campaign fund to a secretive group called Americans for Jobs, Health Care and Progressive Values, which ran a television advertisement in December that showed a close-up of Osama bin Laden and questioned Dr. Dean's ability to compete with Mr. Bush on foreign policy. Though Mr. Torricelli has no formal role in the Kerry campaign, he has solicited donations on its behalf and met with its fund-raisers.","3752":"Although they are impossible to verify independently, one defense official described several individual cases including one man described as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, another who had been involved in planning attacks on tankers in the Persian Gulf, another who officials said was involved in attacks against United States embassies in Africa in 1998 and two others who were involved in financing Qaeda operations.","3753":"The advantages of the match for George W. Bush seemed apparent. 'Golly, she can calm him down,' his father, George H. W. Bush, declared. Her mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, described her early on as 'first lady material.' As for Laura Bush, she had acquired her life's work. 'She knew with assurance that he needed her,' Gerhart writes. 'And she wanted to be needed.' She made a home for him, helped him quit drinking and occasionally reined him in. When he declared he wanted Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive,' she 'sidled up to him and said, 'Bushie, are you gonna git 'im?' '","3755":"In 'Found: A Smoking Gun' (column, Feb. 11), William Safire claims that the recent Kurdish capture of a courier in northern Iraq, who was carrying notes that supposedly request help from Al Qaeda, 'demolishes the repeated claim of Bush critics that there was never a 'clear link' between Saddam and Osama bin Laden.'","3756":"The book also raises wider concerns. Mr. Carroll writes that in 2002 American forces in Afghanistan found a dossier of information about the Plum Island laboratory in the Kabul residence of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a Western-educated nuclear physicist and former chairman of the Pakistan Nuclear Energy Commission who has been identified by American officials as an associate of Osama bin Laden.","3757":"Saddam Hussein (perhaps) aided Mr. Zarqawi, a suspected Jordanian terrorist who supports Al Qaeda. But that doesn't show that Saddam Hussein conspired with Osama bin Laden. C.I.A. interrogations of top Qaeda leaders have revealed that Osama bin Laden ruled out cooperation with Saddam Hussein; documents seized during Saddam Hussein's capture warned Baathists against joining Islamic jihadists.","3758":"That campaign was especially vicious, with Republican advertisements showing Mr. Cleland with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. If that race is any guide, this year's presidential campaign may reach new depths.","3759":"The insurgent groups active now are mostly in the southern and eastern parts of the country, especially on the border with Pakistan, where pro-Taliban and pro-Qaeda elements are believed to be sheltering Osama bin Laden. The Afghan authorities have demobilized 2,700 former soldiers of the country's many militias operating under various warlords, but many more remain active.","376":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 12\u2014 In a series of statements on Tuesday night, this nation's Taliban rulers, hosts to the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden, condemned the attacks on America and said that their notorious guest was not involved.","3760":"General Barno and other American officials have boasted that Osama bin Laden, the elusive leader of Al Qaeda, will be captured this year. He refused to repeat this assertion, though he said, 'We have a very, very high priority in bringing to justice here the leadership of each of the terrorist organizations that we face.'","3761":"And that followed his comments that Saddam Hussein's capture had not made the United States safer and that Osama bin Laden should not be put to death without a fair trial. He promised to 'plug a hole' in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with a vice-presidential candidate. He was hurt further when he shouted at an Iowa voter to sit down, and when film of him insulting the caucus process four years ago was broadcast on the national news.","3762":"Perhaps the best known of these groups, America Coming Together and MoveOn.org, gained widespread attention when George Soros, the philanthropist and international financier, pledged millions to each. Another organization, called Americans for Jobs, Health Care and Progressive Values ran television advertisements attacking Howard Dean's presidential bid, showing a close-up of Osama bin Laden and questioning Dr. Dean's ability to compete with President Bush on foreign policy. Robert G. Torricelli, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey and a fund-raiser for Senator John Kerry, helped finance that organization with $50,000.","3763":"In Ms. White, he has a former prosecutor with a reputation for independence and toughness. She oversaw the first World Trade Center bombing case in 1993 and investigations of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the United States Embassy bombings. Her office examined President Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich and pursued drug lords in Colombia and bankers in Russia. She was United States attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1993 to 2002.","3764":"'Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants,' Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the United Nations Security Council last February.","3765":"All over Brazil, the most popular Carnival masks worn by revelers the past couple of years have been of George W. Bush, Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Mr. Botelho has refused to portray any of them, preferring instead to reproduce the images of local celebrities, like a fondly remembered waiter who died in 1997, a coconut vendor, a singer and a radio soccer broadcaster.","3766":"The notorious foul ball, that is, that inspired the newspaper cartoon several months ago of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein hunkered in a cave alongside a young man wearing a baseball cap, with bin Laden looking quizzically at the guy, and Hussein explaining, 'He's that Cubs fan.'","3767":"There have long been questions about the safety of Plum Island's operations, but they became more prevalent after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Carroll, a lawyer from Bellmore, writes that in 2002 American forces in Afghanistan found a file on the Plum Island laboratory in the home of a nuclear physicist identified by American officials as an associate of Osama bin Laden.","3768":"Mr. Chambliss defeated Mr. Cleland, a Democratic incumbent who lost three limbs in Vietnam, in a 2002 race in which he ran television advertisements showing pictures of Mr. Cleland, Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein to suggest that Mr. Cleland was soft on defense. Mr. Kerry has often said that Mr. Cleland's failure to hit back hard cost him his seat, and on Saturday he appeared to be showing he would not make the same mistake.","3769":"The case is going to be argued before United States District Judge Leonard B. Sand, who three years ago presided over the trial of four associates of Osama bin Laden who were sentenced to life in prison without parole for their roles in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","377":"One of those certain to be high on that list, Osama bin Laden, has made America's helplessness in the face of terrorism a rallying cry, one he has used repeatedly to taunt the United States and to draw new recruits to his ranks of suicide bombers. People close to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, where he lives, today denied responsibility for the attacks.","3770":"American military officials said they expected Taliban and Qaeda fighters to try to disrupt national elections scheduled for June in Afghanistan. American and Pakistani officials said they would step up their efforts to gain control of the rugged border region, the area where they believe the fugitive Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, is hiding.","3771":"'There was no response' at the time, the official said. After receiving the tip, the C.I.A. decided that 'Marwan' was probably an associate of Osama bin Laden, but never tracked him down, American officials say.","3772":"In the most taut exchange, Mr. Kerry again deflected Republican questions about his votes on Pentagon weapons by calling them thinly veiled attacks on his patriotism. He said the criticism was akin to the way former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, a triple amputee from the Vietnam War, was defeated in 2002 after commercials showed his picture and those of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.","3773":"Analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency said the recordings appeared to have been made by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden. 'After conducting a technical analysis, the C.I.A. assesses that the voice on the recordings is probably that of Zawahiri,' a C.I.A. official said.","3774":"The detainees, who thus become the first candidates there to face a military tribunal, were identified as Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al-Bahlul of Yemen and Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al-Qosi of Sudan. They were described in charge sheets, the equivalent of indictments, as senior members of Al Qaeda who had served in a variety of capacities for its leader, Osama bin Laden.","3775":"So far, Mr. Tenet said, there are 'very few' signs of coordination in the anti-American campaign between former members of Mr. Hussein's government and political party and foreign fighters like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian with loose links to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Zarqawi's network was cited by the intelligence chief as a leading example of how Mr. bin Laden's message and tactics had infected Sunni Muslim extremists around the world.","3776":"A senior leader of Al Qaeda threatened further attacks against the United States and lambasted France for banning Islamic head scarves, on two audiotapes broadcast by separate Arab satellite channels. Analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency said the recordings appeared to have been made by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden. A8","3777":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Have students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: \u201cWhat do you know about the investigations into the events of September 11, 2001?\u201d Allow a few minutes to write, then ask students to briefly share their responses. 2. As a class, read and discuss \u201cC.I.A. Was Given Data on Hijacker Long Before 9/11,\u201d using the following questions: a. What information, connected to the events of September 11, 2001, does the independent commission claim the Central Intelligence Agency was given before those events? b. Who provided the C.I.A. with this information? c. Who was Marwan al-Shehhi? d. Who are Mohamed Heidar Zammar and Osama bin Laden? e. Who is Philip Zelikow? f. What does \u201cU.A.E.\u201d stand for, and where is it located? g. Why is the city of Hamburg, Germany a focus of the investigations into the events of September 11, 2001? h. What other geographical locations are mentioned in the article, and why are they mentioned? i. Where did al Qaeda terrorists meet in January of 2000? j. Which two men, identified as September 11 hijackers, were known to have attended this meeting? k. Who was Mohammed Atta? l. What did Marwan al-Shehhi reportedly say to a Hamburg librarian in 2000? 3. Explain to students that they will be researching the various people, places, and institutions associated with the investigations into the events of September 11, 2001. Divide students into small groups, and assign each one of the following topics to research (written on the board or copied in a handout for easier student access): \u2013The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9-11 Commission, and mentioned in the article as an \u201cindependent commission\u201d) \u2013Joint Congressional Inquiry into Intelligence Activities before and after the Events of September 11, 2001 \u2013The Hijackers Involved in the Attacks of September 11, 2001 \u2013al Qaeda Terrorist Network \u2013Domestic Intelligence Agencies (CIA and FBI) \u2013The Bush Administration \u2013German Intelligence \u2013Geographical Locations Connected to September 11 (Hamburg, Germany; San Diego, CA; Venice, FL; Malaysia; United Arab Emirates; Saudi Arabia; Egypt) Explain to students that each group will write an \u201centry\u201d in a class guide to understanding the investigations. Groups are responsible for \u201cdefining and describing\u201d each topic, then explaining its significance in the investigation of the events of September 11, 2001. For example, in the case of the category of \u201cBush Administration,\u201d the group should list the key figures in the administration, and chronicle the administration\u2019s response to the investigations. The group covering the geographical locations associated with the September 11 investigations should identify each on a map, and explain how each city or country has been connected to the events. Students should keep in mind that the \u201caudience\u201d for whom they are writing, people their age, may not know anything about the investigations. 4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: After groups have completed research, students synthesize information for their entries as homework. Entries are to be compiled in the next class period to create the guide. If students wish, they may copy the guide and distribute at school. As a follow-up homework assignment, have students write opinion essays based on their research in class. Ask them to respond to the following question (written on the board for students to copy before leaving class): \u201cBased on the current investigative evidence you researched in class, do you think the United States government could have done more to help prevent the events of September 11, 2001? Why or why not?\u201d","3778":"He called it his 'dream job,' but the dream ended abruptly in November 2002, after a race that turned on Mr. Cleland's vote against the Republican-backed bill to create a Department of Homeland Security. President Bush traveled to Georgia five times to campaign against him. But the low point, Mr. Cleland said, came when Republicans ran an advertisement juxtaposing his face with those of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. The commercial infuriated the Senate's Vietnam veterans, including Mr. Kerry and two Republicans, John McCain and Chuck Hagel, who rushed to Mr. Cleland's defense.","3779":"Neither Mr. Rumsfeld nor Mr. Karzai would comment on impending military operations or the possible capture of Osama bin Laden.","378":"The cruise missiles fired into Afghanistan at Osama bin Laden's men after the bombing of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 were weapons chosen to avoid the risk of American casualties, not ensure the destruction of terrorists.","3780":"Serious as they are, these problems must not become an argument against international justice. With Mr. Hussein awaiting trial, and Osama bin Laden, Kim Jong Il and Charles Taylor of Liberia still out there, the world must believe that global justice is at least possible, if not likely.","3781":"President Bush has approved a plan to intensify the effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, senior administration and military officials say, as a combination of better intelligence, improving weather and a refocusing of resources away from Iraq has reinvigorated the hunt along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.","3782":"Mr. Cleland's loss was, some say, a surprise. He was said to be leading in the polls before Election Day, but ended up losing decisively. Many political observers attribute his loss to President Bush's strong support for Mr. Chambliss, and attack ads picturing Senator Cleland with Osama bin Laden. But others are suspicious of the new voting machines in Georgia.","3783":"President Bush has approved a plan to intensify the effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, officials say. The group at the center of the effort the covert commando involved in Saddam Hussein's capture. 1","3784":"Whether the situation was eased by Mr. Powell's counsel or simply by the sudden sobering up of the leaders of India and Pakistan, the story illustrates the intensity of the Pakistani-American relationship. It is one defined by mutual suspicion, mutual need, awkward disclosures about Pakistan's nuclear activities and a range of urgent issues from tensions with India to the drive to crush terrorism and find Osama bin Laden.","3785":"Apparently Kerry's advisers are worried about a too timely capture of Osama bin Laden, thus: 'This war isn't just a manhunt.' He anticipates criticism for relying too much on the U.N.: 'As president, I will not wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake.' And he has a simplistic, Mr. Fixit solution to terror weapons: 'I propose to appoint a high-level presidential envoy empowered to bring other nations together to secure and stop the spread of these weapons.' That'll solve it.","3786":"'I think it's a real tossup,' Father Lewis said. 'The outcome is really going to depend on what happens between now and the election. Do they find Osama bin Laden? Does the economy get better or worse? It could really go either way.'","3787":"During the American bombing of Tora Bora in Afghanistan in December 2001, American authorities reported hearing Osama bin Laden speaking to his associates on a satellite phone. Since then, Mr. bin Laden has communicated with handwritten messages delivered by trusted couriers, officials said.","3788":"In 1991, Osama bin Laden, who had visited Buraida to lecture on jihad, called Mansour to Jidda. But when Mansour got there, he was apprehensive,he told me, and had no idea whom to contact. After a week or so, he received a letter of apology from some associates of bin Laden's, saying that their leader had to flee the country before the government cracked down on him for fomenting rebellion, but the associates said they hoped to keep up the connection. Mansour was disappointed. The government had refused to give him a passport, and he would most likely never meet the then-Saudi folk hero.","3789":"There are other reasons to be wary of the administration's plan. Democracy, impatiently imposed, can lead to unintended consequences. If the Palestinians were able to choose a leader in truly free elections, might they not opt for the head of Hamas? If free elections were soon held in Saudi Arabia, would Crown Prince Abdullah, a reformer, prevail over Osama bin Laden or another militant Islamic leader? If not genuinely accepted and reinforced by traditions of constitutionalism, democracy can degenerate into plebiscites that only add legitimacy to extremism and authoritarianism.","379":"He said investigators would be pulling in potential witnesses to try to determine what happened. Boston authorities also said today they were trying to ferret out whether the terrorist group had plotted its attack while in Boston, and noted that Boston had already been a chosen center of operations for two men linked to the terrorist Osama bin Laden.","3790":"American troops went to Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden and oust the Taliban government that sheltered him. So far, Mr. bin Laden has not been captured and the Taliban has not been conclusively defeated. Even if both things are accomplished, that will not solve the problem. America took on the challenges of Afghanistan because the breakdown of governmental authority over nearly a quarter-century of civil war had opened the country to international terrorists. Until that authority is effectively re-established by a government that meets the needs and aspirations of Afghans of both genders, America's work will not be completed.","3791":"He declined to discuss that evidence. But another member of Jemaah Islamiyah currently on trial has told Indonesian authorities that he delivered a message from Osama bin Laden to Mr. Bashir shortly after Sept. 11.","3792":"He denounced Osama bin Laden, saying that the Palestinian cause was separate from the broad holy war against the United States embraced by Al Qaeda, the terrorist network let by Mr. bin Laden.","3793":"It's mystifying that the administration hasn't leaned on Pakistan to make Dr. Khan available for interrogation to ensure that his network is entirely closed. Several experts on Pakistan told me they believe that the administration has been so restrained because its top priority isn't combating nuclear proliferation -- it's getting President Pervez Musharraf's help in arresting Osama bin Laden before the November election.","3794":"Spain, an American ally in the war on Iraq, has 1,300 troops stationed there and was explicitly threatened in an audiotape last October reportedly made by Osama bin Laden.","3795":"'Could it have been Islamic fundamentalists?' one senior Spanish antiterrorism official asked last night. 'It could have been. Spain is clearly a target of Al Qaeda; Osama bin Laden has said so himself.'","3796":"But they played down the significance of the step, saying it was not a sweeping 'spring offensive' organized to capture the fugitive Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.","3797":"Administration officials have conceded that their decision was rooted in pragmatism: Mr. Musharraf's assistance was critical in the search for Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda. Mr. Bush decided, they said, that the search for the Qaeda leader must take priority over pressing Pakistan to hand over Mr. Khan and even over investigating the role of the Pakistani military.","3798":"Around the globe, Motley has hired 10 foreign 'informants' -- including a former Taliban official -- whom he insists on referring to by code names (Arnold, the Albanian, the Muslim, Top Source). He has also hired Jean-Charles Brisard, a French intelligence expert, to persuade foreign governments to cooperate with his suit. Brisard is the author of the European best seller 'Forbidden Truth,' which posited that before Sept. 11 the Bush administration tried to coerce the Taliban into surrendering Osama bin Laden in exchange for a lucrative oil pipeline.","3799":"To be sure, the Bush administration's case for war would have been more convincing if there had been any acknowledgment of previous administrations' connivance in Hussein's villainies, including Donald Rumsfeld's friendly visit to Baghdad as President Reagan's envoy in 1983, or the American failure to denounce Hussein's bloody invasion of Iran in 1980 and his gassing of the Kurds in 1988. Like Osama bin Laden, whom the United States bankrolled through the 1980's, Hussein was a monster partly of America's making. The experience ought to teach us that two maxims of so-called realist American foreign policy thinking from cold-war times need to be thrown in the trash. The first is 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend,' and the second is 'He may be a bastard, but at least he's our bastard.' Both principles drove us into the arms of bin Laden and Hussein, and Americans have had to die to free us from their lethal embrace.","38":"WASHINGTON, March 21\u2014 United States officials said today that President Clinton's plan to visit a Bangladeshi village this week was canceled after a terrorist threat possibly linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been accused of terrorism.","3800":"THE threat of global terrorism broadens and strengthens Pollak's narrative, which is more of a scrapbook of impressions, ideas and digressions than the episodic adventure tale it might have been had history not intervened. Charging through Muslim hot spots amid a model United Nations of fellow sailors, Pollak, a contributing editor for The Nation, is in a good position to gather fresh and unguarded responses to the terrorist attacks. An Irish engineer tells him: 'We got used to bombs in Belfast. . . . We stayed away from pubs because you were likely to be blown up.' A harbor pilot in the Suez Canal declares American leaders 'very bad' and reminds Pollak that the C.I.A. backed Osama bin Laden against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Along the way warships bloom on the radar screen as Pollak and the second mate, a British Muslim with family in Pakistan, listen to the BBC over tea, quietly mulling shared fears for loved ones back home.","3801":"In any event, the attacks are clearly consistent with jihadist doctrine and aims. Osama bin Laden, specifically mentioning the loss of southern Spain to Christianity in 1492, has made it clear that any land once in Muslim hands was fair game for global jihad.","3802":"France's senior military officer said Monday that Osama bin Laden had on several occasions narrowly escaped capture by French troops working alongside American forces in Afghanistan, although he conceded that even if they had succeeded, the capture would not of itself suffice to dismantle Al Qaeda.","3803":"Mr. Powell said the United States was pleased that Pakistan had stepped up its operations in the frontier areas abutting Afghanistan, where the remnants of the Taliban are believed to be operating and helping to shelter forces of Al Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden.","3804":"Whatever their motivation, the Socialists' argument was fundamentally flawed. Osama bin Laden and other Islamists had identified Spain as a priority target years before the Iraq war. Under Muslim law, no land conquered by Islam may legitimately come under non-Muslim rule. For the fanatics, Spain is still Al Andalus of the Middle Ages, which must be re-claimed for Islam by immigration and intimidation. Even if the bombs were placed by Islamists, the idea that Spain was attacked solely because of Mr. Aznar's support for the Iraq war is simply wrong.","3805":"After 9/11, terrorism could no longer be ignored, and the military conducted a successful campaign against Al Qaeda's Taliban hosts. But the failure to commit sufficient U.S. forces allowed Osama bin Laden to escape. After that, the administration appeared to lose interest in Al Qaeda; by the summer of 2002, bin Laden's name had disappeared from Mr. Bush's speeches. It was all Saddam, all the time.","3806":"The enduring popularity of Osama bin Laden -- rated favorably by 55 percent of those surveyed in Jordan, 65 percent in Pakistan and 45 percent in Morocco -- underscored the gulf between Muslim attitudes and those in the West.","3807":"Pakistani officials said the fighting had not involved Osama bin Laden or other senior leaders of Al Qaeda, who are believed to be hiding in the border area. But the officials said it was by far the heaviest clash since Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, sent 70,000 troops into the country's isolated tribal areas two years ago to capture suspected Qaeda members.","3808":"The Spaniards are not appeasing Osama bin Laden; they are refusing to continue a collaboration with the Bush administration in its reckless quest for empire. They are the heirs of Churchill, not Chamberlain, and it is past time that we Americans woke up to that fact.","3809":"Days after saying he would press Pakistani officials on whether senior government officials were involved in the proliferation scandal, Mr. Powell praised the government's investigation. He also hailed ongoing Pakistani military operations along the border with Afghanistan designed to capture members of Al Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden.","381":"Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. But the scale and sophistication of the operation, the extraordinary planning required for concerted hijackings by terrorists who had to be familiar with modern jetliners, and the history of major attacks on American targets in recent years led many officials and experts to point to Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant believed to operate out of Afghanistan. Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban rulers rejected such suggestions, but officials took that as a defensive measure.","3810":"There were no reports that Osama bin Laden was in the area, the officials said.","3811":"Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military dictator, would deserve praise if his troops captured Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, whom they think they may have surrounded near the rugged border with Afghanistan. Short of capturing Osama bin Laden himself, there could be no clearer way for General Musharraf to demonstrate how valuable his cooperation can be.","3812":"Pakistani officials said militants made two attempts to break out of the cordon Thursday night, but had been forced back. Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, chief spokesman for the Pakistani military, said at a news briefing Friday that two groups of suspected fighters, one heavily armed, had been apprehended. But he said none of those apprehended appeared to be high-level Qaeda members, and he gave no definite information on the possible whereabouts of Dr. Zawahiri. On Thursday, the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said the 'fierce resistance' put up by the fighters might indicate that a prominent Qaeda leader was in the region. Pakistani military and intelligence officials have said they believe that it is Dr. Zawahiri, an Egyptian eye surgeon said to be Al Qaeda's chief planner and Osama bin Laden's personal physician and confidant.","3813":"USA Today, the nation's largest-circulation newspaper, said Mr. Kelley had engaged in his deceptions around the globe, apparently inventing such accounts as his face-to-face encounter with a suicide bomber in Jerusalem, his participation in a high-speed hunt in 2003 for Osama bin Laden and his witnessing the departure of six refugees from Cuba who, he claimed, later drowned.","3814":"The Pakistani military flew two dozen journalists here for a tightly controlled, two-hour visit and a military briefing. It was a rare glimpse of the isolated region where Dr. Zawahiri, and some say Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, may be hiding.","3815":"His latest paintings, of which seven are on view at the Charles Cowles Gallery in Chelsea until April 10, are packed with the finely wrought details of classic still lifes, but get their punch from their true subjects: war and terrorism. All touch on the fighting in Iraq or the hunt for Osama bin Laden in the wake of 9/11.","3816":"Since Sept. 11, 2001, much of Al Qaeda's original leadership has already been captured, killed or dispersed. The two most prominent survivors -- Osama bin Laden and Dr. Zawahiri, his No. 2 -- will eventually be killed or captured, if not during the operation now under way in Afghanistan, then in one that will surely follow.","3817":"Reports six weeks ago said Mr. Zawahiri -- or even Osama bin Laden -- was hiding in the Shawal Mountains, which lie on the Afghan border, two Pakistani officials said recently. But they said the Qaeda leader left the area before the lead could be pursued.","3818":"Suicide bombers were replaced by triggering devices engineered with cheap cellphones. While disciples of Osama bin Laden are known for favoring symbolism in their targets, these plotters seemed more political. The Madrid attackers struck just three days before the Spanish elections, which dislodged a government that supported the American-led invasion of Iraq. When Mr. Zougam arrived in court after five days incommunicado, he reportedly asked the clerks, 'Who won the elections?'","3819":"A large group of foreign militants who they suspect are allied with Al Qaeda -- and possibly Osama bin Laden himself -- appeared to be safely hiding in Pakistan's tribal areas and mounting cross-border attacks on American forces in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces at the border appeared to do little to stop them.","382":"As for the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, they were, well, far away -- a rebuke to lax embassy security, an opportunity to freshen up our speculative portraits of Osama bin Laden, but a distant horror. Did it register that new elements were creeping into the terrorist modus operandi, that what had previously seemed crudely opportunistic now had a new measure of logistics, and a more surprising range of potential targets?","3820":"The border region is suspected of harboring hundreds of Qaeda fighters and their leaders, including Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda's No. 2 official, Ayman al-Zawahiri.","3821":"The Bush administration, in the middle of its own campaign to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and others it considers terrorists, found itself on Monday in the position of being pressed by world opinion to criticize as 'deeply troubling' Israel's assassination of the leader of Hamas.","3822":"Mr. Clarke, they said, proved to be almost obsessive -- a description he applies to himself in the book -- about attacking Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and impatient that many of his ideas, like forging a closer alliance with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban resistance in Afghanistan, were not adopted.","3823":"Recent developments indicate that Pakistan is now willing to press its troops on the border with Afghanistan to go after a large group of foreign militants with suspected ties to Al Qaeda -- and possibly Osama bin Laden himself -- hiding there, after two assassination attempts on President Pervez Musharraf. A12","3824":"Sheik Yassin was to Israel what Osama bin Laden is to the United States. The war on terror is a war against those who perpetrate terrorist crimes, and Sheik Yassin's death is good news to those who want to see terrorism end.","3825":"Israeli officials, who repeatedly compared Sheik Yassin to Osama bin Laden, said his role was not in the technical details of preparing attacks but in approving them and motivating suicide bombers. 'He was encouraging the phenomenon of suicide bombers,' said Maj. Sharon Feingold, an Army spokeswoman. 'I'm not saying that he specifically sat down and thought through all these attacks, but he definitely gave the go-ahead.'","3826":"The only difference between Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas founder who was killed in Gaza (front page, March 22), and Osama bin Laden is that the percentage of Israelis killed and maimed by Hamas is far greater than the percentage of Americans and Spaniards killed and maimed by Al Qaeda.","3827":"The determination to redress that failure prompted Osama bin Laden and his followers to work for years on the plan that culminated in 9/11. The importance of the towers was clear in Mr. bin Laden's first video message after the attack: 'Those awesome symbolic towers that speak of liberty, human rights and humanity have been destroyed. They have gone up in smoke.'","3828":"Admiral Loy, citing court testimony and government reports, warned two years ago in the military journal Defense Horizons that Osama bin Laden, through associates using flags of convenience, controlled a fleet of cargo ships, including the vessel that delivered the explosives that blew up American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","3829":"Mr. Clarke, by his own account in the book, was obsessed with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. He relentlessly pressed administration officials for a more assertive policy to combat terrorism, including stronger use of the military.","383":"His mention of the terrorists and the countries they operate from were the closest the White House would come to assigning blame for the attacks. Intelligence officials said they strongly believed that Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization was behind the attacks. But Afghanistan and administration officials insisted there was no hard evidence to connect Mr. bin Laden to today's attacks.","3830":"But in this whole period, to say that use of military force to get Al Qaeda when it wasn't going to be a surgical strike -- anybody who thinks that Osama bin Laden might just be laying around somewhere and you can go pick him up -- well, maybe, good luck, but that's a wish, not a strategy or not a military action.","3831":"The Clinton administration's counterterrorism policies were also the subject of sharp questioning at a hearing of the panel, with former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen asked to explain why their colleagues had failed to eliminate the Qaeda network and take Osama bin Laden into custody.","3832":"Former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen testified that his greatest concern on taking office in 1997 was 'that we're able to persuade the American people to having a viable, sustainable national security policy even when there is no clearly identifiable enemy on the horizon,' while Secretary of State Colin L. Powell surmised that even the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden would not have prevented the Sept. 11 attacks, because the hijackers were already at work on American shores.","3833":"In 1996, the C.I.A. secretly created a special operational unit devoted to tracking a single man, a Saudi-born exile named Osama bin Laden, then living in Sudan and considered a major terrorist financier. By early 1997, the office, known as the bin Laden station, had concluded that he was also a terrorist organizer, based in Afghanistan, with a military committee planning operations against American interests worldwide.","3835":"Mr. Clarke's appearance before the commission, which is in the final weeks of an investigation of intelligence and law-enforcement failures before the 9/11 attacks, overshadowed the drama of testimony earlier in the day from George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, and Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser. Mr. Tenet and Mr. Berger were sharply questioned about why two administrations in a row have been unable to stop Al Qaeda and kill or capture its leader, Osama bin Laden.","3836":"The Clinton administration also made mistakes. Although aware of the danger posed by Osama bin Laden, it was somehow unable to create and carry out an effective strategy to deal with him. Bill Clinton, distracted by the threat of impeachment, failed to educate the American people adequately about the nature of the danger, and what it might take to fight it. Senior officials from the Clinton and Bush administration testified, one after another, that in the pre-9/11 world, they could not have gone further in trying to run down Mr. bin Laden because, they believed, the country and our allies would not have supported it.","3837":"Dan Gillerman, the Israeli ambassador, responded that 'to characterize him as a spiritual leader is to attempt to characterize Osama bin Laden as a Mother Teresa.' He said it would be the 'ultimate hypocrisy' if the Council were seen to be defending 'the godfather of terrorism.'","3838":"NICK GROLEAU, a 40-year-old technical manager from Mountain View, Calif., received a message last month from a friend on his AOL Instant Messenger buddy list alerting him that Osama bin Laden had been captured. When he clicked on a link ostensibly directing him to a news article, it took him instead to a site offering a game to download.","3839":"To some degree, her view was echoed by two other witnesses, Steven Simon, an analyst for the Rand Corporation, and Robert Baer, a former Central Intelligence Agency agent. Mr. Simon described a country where Osama bin Laden, a Saudi native and the leader of Al Qaeda, 'is revered' and supporters would always find a way to get him and others the financial support they need to plan future attacks.","384":"In arguing against an Arab link, officials and local experts on extremist groups pointed to the complex choreography of the attack. But in the Middle East, as elsewhere, intense speculation focused on Osama bin Laden or related organization, partly because the attacks involved suicide pilots. Suicide bombers from extremist Muslim organizations generally believe that they are fighting for their faith and are promised paradise if they die for the cause.","3840":"It cannot have escaped anyone's attention that the Bush administration has spent the better part of the week in full counterattack mode against Richard Clarke, the former White House antiterrorism czar who says the president and his senior officials greatly underrated the threat from Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in the months leading up to 9/11. Nearly everyone of consequence in President Bush's inner circle appears to have been requisitioned to challenge Mr. Clarke's integrity and motives, accusing him of everything from trying to drum up sales for his new book to auditioning for a job in a John Kerry administration. The field of critics is so crowded that they're tripping over each other, as when Condoleezza Rice felt obliged to correct Vice President Dick Cheney's assertion that Mr. Clarke had never been 'in the loop.'","3841":"Mr. Clarke, President Bush's former counterterrorism chief, writes in his book, 'Against All Enemies,' that despite clear evidence the attacks had been the work of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, top administration officials focused almost immediately on the object of their obsession, Iraq.","3842":"'I call on Muslims in Pakistan to get rid of their government, which is working for Americans,' said the voice on the tape, which sounded like previous recordings of Dr. Zawahiri, the right-hand man of Osama bin Laden. Americans believe Dr. Zawahiri played a major role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.","3843":"The second goal was a more competitive stance toward China. Missile defense -- this time against attack by China and North Korea -- was put back on the table. Even the collision of an American spy plane with a Chinese fighter in 2001 is an indication of the administration's mindset -- intelligence resources were deployed not to find Osama bin Laden, but to monitor what many White House hawks considered the most likely future challenger of American power.","3844":"There has been much fulminating in the media and by some senators on the other side about a new book by a former State Department civil servant named Richard Clarke. In this book, released for sale by the parent company of the CBS network, Mr. Clarke makes the outrageous charge that the Bush administration, in its first seven months in office, failed to adequately address the threat posed by Osama bin Laden. . . .","3845":"Osama bin Laden, while hardly a household name, was well known as a threat. (Indeed, this newspaper ran a front-page series about him just as the Bush administration was entering office.)","3846":"HOW much is Osama bin Laden worth? Does $50 million sound about right?","3847":"The fierceness of the fight suggested that hundreds of foreign militants, perhaps including Osama bin Laden and his top deputy, may have turned the South Waziristan tribal agency into their new base for operations. At the same time, Pakistan's army appeared to have bungled a critical operation there or to have wavered in the face of determined resistance.","3849":"A review of the evidence produced this week provides relatively little direct information about Mr. Bush's thinking, statements or actions regarding terrorism in the months after he took office. The commission's reports suggest that he left the issue largely to top advisers, who studied it, but took no concrete action against Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden.","385":"Mr. Putin in recent months has called on the Bush administration to join Russia in combating terrorist groups in Afghanistan and Central Asia, including that of Osama bin Laden. Russia gives clandestine aid to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, which has been fighting the Taliban. On Sunday, an alliance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was reportedly wounded by a bomb.","3850":"IN the war on terrorism, Osama bin Laden is now the prime target. Few Americans would argue that assassinating the terrorist they hold responsible for the deaths of more than 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, would be contrary to either American or international law.","3851":"Moroccan officials say he met several times that year with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a confederate of Osama bin Laden who, antiterrorism officials say, is behind a series of attacks. They say Mr. Benyaich was also part of a broader group aligned with Al Qaeda called the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group.","3852":"In Bob Woodward's 'Bush at War,' the president himself acknowledged that Osama bin Laden had not been a central focus in the eight months before the attacks.","3853":"The construction of the Freedom Tower, far from being 'reflexive bravado,' in Daniel Benjamin's words (Op-Ed, March 23), sends a breathtakingly simple message to Osama bin Laden and all the would-be bin Ladens: 'We do not fear you. We can, and will, protect ourselves, and we will prosper. We will, in our lifetimes, be privileged to see the destruction and defeat of you and your minions of evil.'","3854":"Interdisciplinary Connections:Fine Arts- How has the American flag been used as both a subject and symbol?

Teaching with The Times- The article mentions running a front-page series about Osama bin Laden as the Bush administration was entering office. Find, read, and write a review of this series.","3855":"The United States military is shifting tactics in the hope that a better relationship with local Afghans will produce better intelligence as the effort intensifies to find Osama bin Laden and uproot the Taliban. A mission once limited to policing and hunting has become an exercise in nation building. A1","3856":"'If we're going to have a discussion about W.M.D. and intelligence failures and Osama bin Laden, that's not an election George W. Bush wins,' the adviser said. 'If it's about who keeps you safer, that's the ground we want to be on.'","3857":"And new evidence keeps emerging for Mr. Clarke's main charge, that the Iraq obsession undermined the pursuit of Al Qaeda. From yesterday's USA Today: 'In 2002, troops from the Fifth Special Forces Group who specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for Osama bin Laden to prepare for their next assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with expertise in Spanish cultures.'","3858":"As the effort to find Osama bin Laden and uproot the Taliban intensifies, the United States military is shifting tactics. A mission once limited to sweeps, raids and searches has in recent months yielded to an exercise in nation building. The hope is that a better relationship with local residents and a stronger Afghan state will produce better intelligence and a speedier American departure. But the tension between building schools one day and rounding up suspects at gunpoint the next makes the prospects for success far from clear.","3859":"Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are on the brink of achieving an unanticipated victory, one that could have long-term consequences for the United States.","386":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 12\u2014 In a series of statements on Tuesday night, this nation's Taliban rulers, hosts to the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden, condemned the attacks on America and said that their notorious guest was not involved.","3860":"Mr. Clarke's accusation that before 9/11 the Bush White House did not address the danger of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda with urgency is echoed by the president's own remarks in Bob Woodward's 2002 book, 'Bush at War,' in which he said he 'was not on point' before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11: 'I was prepared to look at a plan that would be a thoughtful plan that would bring him to justice and would have given the order to do that. I have no hesitancy about going after him. But I didn't feel that sense of urgency, and my blood was not nearly as boiling.'","3861":"White House officials said the language showed that the Bush administration had a tougher, more comprehensive plan than the Clinton administration had for dealing with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and the Taliban. Ms. Rice has cited the directive in recent interviews in trying to undermine the credibility of Richard A. Clarke, Mr. Bush's former counterterrorism director, who has accused the Bush administration of largely ignoring terrorist threats before Sept. 11.","3862":"Mr. Lindsey said he had reviewed many of the 10,800 documents gathered by the National Archives, where Mr. Clinton's files are stored, and found them to be valuable to the commission's work. He said they included many documents about Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and the government's counterterrorism policies.","3863":"There were also no specific new military plans for attacking Qaeda forces or the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The Pentagon's priorities that summer were developing a national missile defense plan and conducting a broad strategy and budget review. Military planners had previously offered a comprehensive plan to incorporate military, economic, diplomatic and political activities to pressure the Taliban to expel Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden. But the plan was never acted on by either the Clinton or Bush administrations.","3864":"This claim is the most ambitious and impressive aspect of 'Occidentalism,' and yet as an argument it surely needs further development. Heidegger, Pol Pot and Mao Zedong may all have despised the cosmopolitan city, with its political corruption, loose sexual mores and commercialized glamour. Solzhenitsyn, Osama bin Laden and Herder may all have preached against sterile rationalism and the instrumental, secular view of life. But it is unpersuasive to locate the universalizing goals of Maoism in the ideas of the supremely localist Counter-Enlightenment, and just as unpersuasive to link the blood-and-culture movements of the Counter-Enlightenment to radical, global Islam. Buruma and Margalit are on firmer ground when they show that all these elements are united in their portrayal of the cowardly West as so weakened by its addiction to material pleasures that it is unable to make the sacrifices necessary for its own defense.","3865":"It was 27 months ago that Bob Woodward, writing in The Washington Post, first quoted the president as saying that he 'didn't feel that sense of urgency' about Osama bin Laden before 9/11. The Bush administration's downsizing, stalling and fumbling of the fight against terrorism in the seven-plus months between Inauguration Day and 9/11 was reported by Time in August 2002. The failure of Ms. Rice to advance Mr. Clarke's Jan. 25, 2001, memo on al Qaeda's urgent threat has been recounted (and sourced) in detail in such best sellers as Steve Coll's 'Ghost Wars' and Craig Unger's 'House of Bush, House of Saud,' both of which beat Mr. Clarke's own account to the stores. (Still to come is a new Woodward best seller about the ramp-up to Iraq, 'Plan of Attack,' which '60 Minutes' will herald two weeks from tonight and which Rush Limbaugh is already pre-emptively trashing as being from 'the same publisher' as the Clarke book.)","3866":"Such Spenglerian talk has gained credibility since 9/11. The '3/11' bombings in Madrid confirm that terrorists sympathetic to Osama bin Laden continue to operate with comparative freedom in European cities. Some American commentators suspect Europeans of wanting to appease radical Islam. Others detect in sporadic manifestations of anti-Semitism a sinister conjunction of old fascism and new fundamentalism.","3867":"Two years ago, the joint Congressional committee looking into pre-9/11 intelligence made reference to the participation of Saudi clerics -- salifi -- in the preparation of additional fatwas issued by Osama bin Laden in 1998 in which he 'declared war' against Americans. What's more, the director of the National Security Agency reportedly told a closed session of that committee that on Sept. 10, 2001, his agency intercepted messages by the 9/11 hijackers. The messages, which went untranslated until Sept. 12, were reportedly not to Osama bin Laden but to Saudi clerics.","3868":"There's even more nervousness about the unknown. Will there be a pre-election terror attack, a concern obviously heightened by the pre-election train bombing in Madrid last month? Will Osama bin Laden be captured? Will weapons of mass destruction finally be found in Iraq? And will Bill Clinton really publish his memoir midway through the year, as has been promised, and if so, what dirt will the former president dish? 'There are a lot of outside forces that are going to be important,' said Ken Mehlman, Mr. Bush's campaign manager. 'We recognize that. And we have got to deal with that.'","3869":"Fair enough, but are there people who are simply unworthy of our compassion? Do you have compassion for Osama bin Laden?","387":"One of those certain to be high on that list, Osama bin Laden, has made America's helplessness in the face of terrorism a rallying cry, one he has used repeatedly to taunt the United States and to draw new recruits to his ranks of suicide bombers. People close to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, where he lives, today denied responsibility for the attacks.","3870":"Her public speeches and interviews tended to focus on more orthodox foreign-policy issues, including relations with China (particularly after an American surveillance plane was forced down there in the early weeks of the administration); the new relationship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader; and the threat posed by Iraq and Iran, all of which she had emphasized in a lengthy essay in the January 2000 issue of Foreign Affairs. That essay became the blueprint for Bush's presidential campaign, in which he never mentioned Osama bin Laden or the Qaeda network.","3871":"They are regarded as sickening symptoms of poverty, uncleanliness and despair. And they have become metaphors for heinous behavior: hatred, ruthlessness and double dealing. The New York Post repeatedly draws analogies between terrorists and rats, comparing Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein to that most notorious of vermin.","3872":"Peace talks between Khartoum and the rebels began this week in neighboring Chad, but are faltering for want of sufficient pressure from the United States, the European Union and African states. The United States should use its leverage with Khartoum -- which sheltered Osama bin Laden for six years but now wants to improve ties with Washington -- to demand that aid agencies and humanitarian monitors have unhindered access to the displaced. If they need military protection, then the international community should be willing to provide it.","3873":"The suit asserts that Mr. Hamdan, a Yemeni, was never involved with Al Qaeda or with any military action against American forces in Afghanistan. He is described as a Muslim pilgrim who went to Afghanistan on the way to Tajikistan. Failing to get there, the papers say, he took a job as a driver on Osama bin Laden's Afgan farm and later became a driver for Mr. bin Laden himself.","3874":"Ms. Rice offered a spirited, unapologetic defense of the Bush administration's efforts against terrorism before Sept. 11, insisting that Mr. Bush had been aware of threats from Osama bin Laden's terrorist network throughout 2001 and had done all he could to prevent attacks.","3875":"Ms. Rice was at her weakest in her testimony before the independent commission investigating the 9/11 attacks when she attempted to portray Mr. Bush himself as a hands-on administrator with a particular concern about terror threats. Her description of the president as tired of 'swatting flies' and spoiling for a real fight with Osama bin Laden was especially poorly chosen. 'Can you tell me one example where the president swatted a fly when it came to Al Qaeda prior to 9/11?' asked former Senator Bob Kerrey.","3877":"'The real damage the C.I.A. did was not the providing of arms and money,' he writes, ' but the privatization of information about how to produce and spread violence -- the formation of private militias -- capable of creating terror.' The best-known C.I.A.-trained terrorist, he notes dryly, is Osama bin Laden.","3878":"It's not just that the Bush administration's arrogance and unilateralism have led Pakistanis to give Osama bin Laden a 65 percent favorable rating, compared with 7 percent for President Bush (the latest international polls from the Pew Research Center make you want to cry). Even in traditional allies like Spain, which we now need to fix the mess in Iraq, the good will after 9/11 has dissolved into suspicion and hostility.","3879":"President Bush was told in a secret meeting on Aug. 6, 2001, that supporters of Osama bin Laden planned an attack 'within the United States' with explosives and wanted to hijack airplanes, a government official said. A1","388":"The missing included one of the country's top counterterrorism experts, John P. O'Neill, the 49-year-old former special agent in charge of national security in the F.B.I.'s New York office, who oversaw the investigation of what the authorities called a global terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, including the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa. Mr. O'Neill retired from the F.B.I. last month and was named director of security for the World Trade Center.","3880":"President Bush was told more than a month before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that supporters of Osama bin Laden planned an attack within the United States with explosives and wanted to hijack airplanes, a government official said Friday.","3881":"Testimony this week before the 9/11 commission by the heads of both agencies appears likely to lead to another round of headlines about miscommunications between the two agencies. And it could dredge up old animosities. On Friday, the White House appeared to signal an effort to distance itself from the F.B.I. by offering evidence that the bureau was instructed more than two months before the Sept. 11 attacks to increase scrutiny of suspected terrorists within the United States. And officials said that President Bush was told more than a month before Sept. 11 that supporters of Osama bin Laden planned an attack within the United States with explosives and wanted to hijack airplanes.","3882":"By Sept. 11, 2001, Dick Clarke had become the ultimate White House insider; he was not only a Clinton holdover, he was a holdover from the first Bush administration and had served in the Reagan State Department. He had been working at the National Security Council for about a decade, and in 1998 had been named White House counterterrorism coordinator by President Clinton. He was asked to stay on in the same post by the second Bush administration. But he had quickly become frustrated by the new team's unwillingness to address the mounting threat from Osama bin Laden. By the morning of Sept. 11, he was still handling counterterrorism, but was planning to leave for a lower-profile assignment dealing with cybersecurity.","3885":"In her long-awaited testimony to the commission on Thursday, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, acknowledged that the briefing contained a blunt warning that Osama bin Laden intended to attack 'inside the United States' and that the F.B.I. had detected a 'suspicious pattern' that could suggest plans for a domestic hijacking.","3886":"Khallad was later identified by the C.I.A. as one of Osama bin Laden's operational lieutenants; he is now in United States custody.","3887":"'Hey, Osama bin Laden!' he recalled the voice screaming, 'go back to your own country!' It was, he said, a taste of what the new world would be like.","3888":"Abu Sayyaf was founded in the early 1990's with the goal of creating an Islamic state in the Philippines. Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, provided early encouragement and financial support. Within a few years, however, Abu Sayyaf had lost most of its religious orientation and become what American officials called 'thugs for hire.'","3889":"Once again I know that President Clinton, President Bush and Ms. Rice all faced difficult challenges in the years and months before 9/11; I do not know if I would have handled things differently had I been in their shoes. It has been difficult for all of us to understand and accept the idea that a non-state actor like Osama bin Laden, in conjunction with Al Qaeda, could be a more serious strategic threat to us than the nation-states we grew up fearing.","389":"The hijackers were followers of Osama bin Laden, officials say. A1","3890":"Furthermore, testimony before the 9/11 commission reveals that both the Clinton and Bush administrations saw few options for striking at Al Qaeda. Prior to 9/11 there was no political support for invading Afghanistan, the best way to neutralize Al Qaeda. Mr. Unger chides President Bush for not using the Predator drone to try to kill Osama bin Laden. But there were obstacles other than his alleged reluctance to take on Islamic terror because of his fondness for the royal family. During the Clinton administration, for example, C.I.A. officials had maintained that Mr. bin Laden could be lawfully killed only if he died in an operation intended to capture him.","3891":"By October 2003, the same month Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, listed Spain as one of several enemy countries, other intelligence assessments were even more alarming.","3892":"The answer, Mr. Bush said on Sunday, was that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating known links to Osama bin Laden in the United States, with 70 active cases reported that summer. 'That's great, that's what we expect the F.B.I. to do,' he told reporters.","3893":"In a hodgepodge not unusual in the intelligence world, the Aug. 6 item about Al Qaeda's plans cited facts and unverifiable claims as evidence. But the 11 dispassionate paragraphs represented what intelligence officials described on Sunday as a boiled-down version of all the C.I.A. had learned, guessed or been told since 1997 about Osama bin Laden's intentions for an American strike.","3894":"The 'fact sheet' the White House released over the weekend along with the August 2001 briefing memo hardly shows any rethinking of the way Mr. Bush operates his government. It is instead an extraordinary exercise in bureaucratic excuse making and misdirection. It says that the notion that Osama bin Laden wanted to mount an attack on the United States was familiar information and 'publicly well known.' It said the presence of Qaeda agents in the United States was equally old news to the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies. It makes it sound as if everyone knew about Osama bin Laden's danger to America except the inattentive president.","3895":"'I am satisfied that I never saw any intelligence that indicated there was going to be an attack on America -- at a time and a place, an attack,' Mr. Bush said after attending Easter services in Fort Hood, Tex. 'Of course we knew that America was hated by Osama bin Laden. That was obvious. The question was, who was going to attack us, when and where, and with what.'","3896":"In a preview of his testimony, Mr. Freeh defended his tenure in an opinion article published Monday on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, saying that the F.B.I. 'used all the means at its disposal' before Sept. 11 to capture Osama bin Laden and prevent attacks.","3897":"This is an explicit warning that Osama bin Laden would attack the World Trade Center.","3898":"Judge Garz\u00f3n indicted Osama bin Laden and 34 others, including Mr. Zouaydi, in connection with the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, which were partly planned in Spain. Mr. Zouaydi's lawyer, Manuel Tuero, explained that his client, who has been held since November 2001, had asked to respond to various charges against him.","3899":"A flight on Sept. 20, 2001, carried 26 passengers, most of them relatives of Osama bin Laden, according to the statement. But all 142 passengers on the flights, mostly Saudi citizens, were screened by law enforcement officials, the statement said, to ensure that they were not security threats and not wanted for questioning. The flights were 'dealt with in a professional manner' by the government, the commission said.","39":"American officials said Mr. Clinton's plan to visit a Bangladeshi village this week had been canceled after a terrorist threat that was possibly linked to Osama bin Laden. A18","390":"First we have to prove that we are serious, and that we understand that many of these terrorists hate our existence, not just our policies. In June I wrote a column about the fact that a few cell-phone threats from Osama bin Laden had prompted President Bush to withdraw the F.B.I. from Yemen, a U.S. Marine contingent from Jordan and the U.S. Fifth Fleet from its home base in the Persian Gulf. This U.S. retreat was noticed all over the region, but it did not merit a headline in any major U.S. paper. That must have encouraged the terrorists. Forget about our civilians, we didn't even want to risk our soldiers to face their threats.","3900":"Q. -- To move to the 9/11 commission, you yourself have acknowledged that Osama bin Laden was not a central focus of the administration in the months before Sept. 11. 'I was not on point,' you told the journalist Bob Woodward. 'I didn't feel that sense of urgency.' Two and a half years later, do you feel any sense of personal responsibility for Sept. 11?","3901":"Q. Do you recall -- and excuse me for pushing you on this -- but do you recall mentioning Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, domestic cells of terrorists in the United States to the new attorney general?","3902":"In response to questions about his administration's preparedness for a terrorist attack, he said he was 'sick when I think about the death that took place on that day.' But, he said, 'the person responsible for the attacks was Osama bin Laden.'","3903":"After President Bush came into office, the commission staff found, Attorney General John Ashcroft lowered the priority of the entire counterterrorism issue in his strategic planning. Mr. Ashcroft, who came before the panel defensive and ready for a fight, did not concede the slightest failing on the part of the Bush administration. But the acting F.B.I. director in 2001, Thomas Pickard, testified that he had never seen the famous presidential briefing of Aug. 6, 2001, which talked about a domestic threat from Al Qaeda and dozens of F.B.I. investigations of potential domestic terrorists that were reported to be under way. Communication on the subject seemed nonexistent. In that summer of sky-high terrorist threats, the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency did not even consult the F.B.I. to determine whether Osama bin Laden wanted to attack the United States.","3904":"After the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, then-Director Louis J. Freeh of the F.B.I. began to consider shifting from a crime-solving approach to prevention. He set up a program to exchange C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials, to better understand the international threat, created a unit on Osama bin Laden and expanded the presence of F.B.I. legal attach\u00e9s at American embassies.","3905":"But the simple fact of Sept. 11 is this: We did not know an attack was coming, because for nearly a decade our government had blinded itself to its enemies. Our agents were isolated by government-imposed walls, handcuffed by government-imposed restrictions and starved for basic information technology. The old national intelligence system in place on Sept. 11 was destined to fail. . . . This commission has debated the nature of covert-action authorities directed at Osama bin Laden prior to 2001. In February 2001, shortly after becoming attorney general, I reviewed these authorities. Let me be clear, my thorough review revealed no covert-action program to kill bin Laden. There was a covert-action program to capture bin Laden for criminal prosecution.","3906":"Between 1997 and the 2001 attacks, the report said, the agencies did not update a National Intelligence Estimate that was originally produced in 1995 on the threat of a foreign terrorist attack on the United States. That left the agencies' most important forum for assessing threats silent about an attack on American soil by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda during critical years, the report said.","3907":"I watched the telecast of Attorney General John Ashcroft's testimony (front page, April 14), and saw parts of the testimonies of F.B.I. and C.I.A. leaders. The condescending and arrogant attitude of the 9/11 commissioners is becoming increasingly disturbing. Al Qaeda committed numerous acts of terrorism before 9/11, so all of these men and women knew that Osama bin Laden was formidable.","3909":"While praising Mr. Tenet's energy and his understanding of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, several commission members said the staff report showed the need for an overhaul of the C.I.A., possibly through the creation of a Cabinet-level post for a national intelligence director who would control the budget of the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies.","391":"Mr. Bush must also seek cooperation from responsible Arab and Islamic governments, just as his father did in preparing to drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. A particularly difficult challenge is posed by Pakistan, a traditional American ally that now acts as unofficial patron to Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. The Taliban is believed to be sheltering the most dangerous international terrorist, Osama bin Laden. Although no conclusive evidence has yet linked Mr. bin Laden to this week's attacks, he is among the chief suspects. Washington made clear yesterday that its patience with Pakistan is rapidly running out.","3910":"As the president rightly said on Tuesday night, the only people responsible for the slaughter in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001, were Osama bin Laden and the other terrorists. But to watch these hearings is to endure a terrifying review of the chances missed and balls dropped in the last two administrations.","3911":"A man identifying himself as Osama bin Laden offered on Thursday to stop terrorist actions in European countries that ended military action in Muslim nations. The offer was made on an audiotape broadcast by two Arab satellite television stations.","3912":"After reading 'The Price of Incuriosity' (editorial, April 15), I have an idea. Let us suppose we had a forceful, take-charge, insightful president. On reading the briefing, he (or she) would immediately realize the significance of the warning that the United States was Osama bin Laden's strategic target: a potentially catastrophic attack was in the works against a vulnerable society.","3913":"A man identifying himself as Osama bin Laden on an audiotape offered to stop terrorist actions in European countries that ended military action in Muslim nations. Many countries issued statements saying that negotiations under terrorist threats were out of the question. A3","3914":"An audiotape of a man identifying himself as Osama bin Laden offered to stop terrorist actions in European countries that ended military action in Muslim nations. Page A3.","3915":"It wouldn't have been easy, and it's likely that a Gore administration would not have prevented the attacks either. But President Bush's assertion this week that 'nobody in our government at least -- and I don't think the prior government -- could envision flying airplanes into buildings on such a massive scale' was disingenuous. So was his refusal to accept responsibility for lapses before 9/11. Just suppose that after the Aug. 6, 2001, presidential briefing about Osama bin Laden's plans, the conversation had gone like this:","3916":"Moreover, the traditional techniques of the human rights movement are unlikely to work with Al Qaeda. One can hardly imagine Osama bin Laden opening thousands of letters entreating him to desist from violence or scanning a Congressional resolution calling for his capture and proclaiming, 'By Jove, they're right!'","3918":"The threat reports were more clear, urgent and persistent than was previously known. Some focused on Al Qaeda's plans to use commercial aircraft as weapons. Others stated that Osama bin Laden was intent on striking on United States soil. Many were passed to the Federal Aviation Administration.","3919":"'We are now spending about $40 billion for intelligence,' Mr. MacGaffin said. 'For your $40 billion, you as a taxpayer should be entitled to having one guy sitting on a rock next to Osama bin Laden somewhere in Afghanistan, and maybe one guy sitting in the middle of a group of extremists here in this country.'","392":"The accused terrorist Osama bin Laden has found a home here, angering much of the world. In 1998, America fired a volley of more than 70 cruise missiles at guerrilla training camps reportedly operated by the Saudi multimillionaire. Now, there seems to be the prospect of another barrage, with Afghan hospitality to the same man as the cause.","3920":"But Unger is right to point out that the Saudis have always been fair-weather friends. The problem, in his words, was that they 'were already married to someone else': Islamic fundamentalism. Washington may have once been able to overlook Riyadh's other affections; indeed, during the 1980's, the Reagan administration thought it could harness Saudi radicalism for use against the Soviet empire. But on Sept. 11, 2001, Saudi extremism quite literally blew up in America's face, thanks to the work of the most famous Saudi of them all, Osama bin Laden.","3921":"The commission investigating the attacks disclosed that intelligence officials were warned in the summer of 2001 that Osama bin Laden was 'planning high-profile attacks' and that George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, had received a briefing that August titled 'Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly,' about the arrest days earlier of Zacarias Moussaoui. Attorney General John Ashcroft was also portrayed as being inattentive to terrorism before the attacks -- a charge he heatedly denied.","3922":"LIKE the other audiotapes that have preceded it, the tape of Osama bin Laden that surfaced last week was a demonstration of Al Qaeda's grasp of the principle of economy of means: you can commandeer world attention with a $20 cassette recorder in the same way you can commandeer an airplane with $3 box cutters.","3923":"To revisit 'Lawrence' and the history it dramatizes in embryo is to feel not only d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu but also a roaring anger at the American arrogance and ignorance that has led to the current nightmare. Condoleezza Rice's use of the word 'historical' to describe the Aug. 6, 2001, presidential briefing on Osama bin Laden was not the only tipoff to her limited understanding of history. In the opening filibuster of her testimony, she invoked the Lusitania, Hitler's rise and Pearl Harbor as analogues of 9/11 -- an asymmetrical comparison that blurs the distinctions between nations' acts of war and the stateless conspiracies of modern terrorists. Apparently the administration's understanding of British colonial history in the Middle East is no sharper. Though it might have been impossible to prevent the 9/11 attacks, it would have been possible to avoid what's happening in Iraq now had anyone heeded the past. However much the current crisis may be a function of a military bungle like Donald Rumsfeld's inadequate deployment of troops or the diplomatic failure to attract a proper coalition, it is above all else the product of cultural hubris.","3924":"The region is suspected of being a hideout for the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri.","3925":"With his misbegotten war in Iraq, his failure to throw everything we had at Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and his fantasy of using military might as a magic wand to 'change the world,' President Bush has ushered the American people into a bloody and mind-bending theater of the absurd.","3926":"May our American forces have similar success in ending the scourge of Dr. Rantisi's counterpart who seeks to end Western civilization: Osama bin Laden.","3927":"The general would not discuss the suspected whereabouts of Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. But he said he thought reports that a senior Qaeda leader had been surrounded in fighting in South Waziristan in March were not accurate.","3928":"Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, who indicted Osama bin Laden and 34 others in September in Spain, charged five more people with belonging to or supporting a Qaeda cell there. A12","3929":"The newspaper, in reporting the preliminary findings of reporters and editors who had been investigating his work, said that Mr. Kelley had engaged in his deceptions around the globe. Among what were apparently inventions were accounts of his encounter with a suicide bomber in Jerusalem, his participation in a high-speed hunt in 2003 for Osama bin Laden and his witnessing of the departure of six refugees from Cuba who, he claimed, later drowned.","393":"Any military action carries political consequences as well as risks to the fighting forces, and there is never a guarantee of success, as the United States found out when it tried to retaliate against the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden for the bombing of two United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","3930":"Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, who indicted Osama bin Laden and 34 others in September, has charged five more people with belonging to or supporting a Qaeda cell in Spain.","3931":"The bombing and the clashes preceding it represent a qualitative shift in the ongoing war between the security services and Islamic militants believed to be either directly connected to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda or inspired by the terrorist group, Saudi officials and other analysts said. It was a shift, they said, toward attacks by groups that are less organized, on targets that are less easily protected.","3932":"In Iraq, attacks by American troops serve as evidence to some that the United States occupation of a Muslim land must be reversed. Requests for God to avenge American actions pour down from mosque minarets, and some women university students sport Osama bin Laden T-shirts under their enveloping abayas to show their approval for his calls to resist the United States.","3933":"Mr. Moussaoui is a French citizen who readily acknowledges his membership in the Qaeda network and his loyalty to Osama bin Laden but who has denied guilt in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He was arrested on immigration charges in August 2001 after arousing suspicion at a Minnesota flight school.","3934":"The tribesmen were expected to hand in a list of foreign militants living with them in South Waziristan, a desolate region where the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, have been hunted in the past.","3935":"Ironically, as Mr. Clinton prepared for the Jan. 20, 2001, transfer of power, he told Mr. Rather that he would recommend the Gary Cooper western to George W. Bush. As of last summer, President Bush had screened it only once in the White House, in late September 2001, not long after declaring that he wanted Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.' Mr. Bush did present a 'High Noon' poster to the Japanese prime minister, who said that 'Gary Cooper fought a lonely battle against a gang, but this time the whole world stands with the United States.' (According to the Kyodo News Agency, the two had bonded over 'High Noon' several months before, 'comparing themselves to the lone, stoic and honor-bound marshal.') Like his father before him, Mr. Bush gave Saddam Hussein a 'high noon' deadline to get out of town. And more forcefully than any American president since his fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson, Mr. Bush has argued the need for pre-emptive action to forestall violence that -- no less than Cooper's marshal -- he alone was sure would occur.","3936":"Other parts of the war of ideas include making real progress on the Israel-Palestinian issue, while safe-guarding Israeli security, and finding ideological and religious counter-weights to Osama bin Laden and the radical imams. Fashioning a comprehensive strategy to win the battle of ideas should be given as much attention as any other aspect of the war on terrorists, or else we will fight this war for the foreseeable future. For even when Osama bin Laden is dead, his ideas will carry on. Even as Al Qaeda has had its leadership attacked, it has morphed into a hydra, carrying out more major attacks in the 30 months since 9/11 than it did in the three years before.","3937":"Karl Rove and Karen Hughes know better than to take on those families who sent loved ones to Iraq and are now getting increasingly impatient with the war or turning against it. In any event, the tragic familial soap opera is just too entrenched in the culture for networks to forsake it, no matter what the White House has to say about it. Starting in 1996, when Fox News and MSNBC ended CNN's monopoly in the 24/7 cable news business, the suffering of those who have lost their children or parents, either to apocalyptic calamities or everyday crimes, has become the surefire ratings winner of TV news, cable and network alike. Prior to 9/11, American TV viewers knew more about Chandra Levy's shattered parents and the parents of Columbine victims than about Osama bin Laden. (For the fifth anniversary this week, the Columbine families have returned to TV for an encore.) Even after 9/11, Americans have learned more about the bereft families of Elizabeth Smart and Laci Peterson than Ayatollah al-Sistani. Such families were bigger news 'gets' than Paul Wolfowitz and L. Paul Bremer ever were -- much as the families and neighbors of Specialist Michelle Witmer, Thomas Hamill and Pfc. Keith Maupin are now.","3938":"They swear allegiance to Osama bin Laden and his goal of toppling Western democracies to establish an Islamic superstate under Shariah law, like Afghanistan under the Taliban. They call the Sept. 11 hijackers the 'Magnificent 19' and regard the Madrid train bombings as a clever way to drive a wedge into Europe.","3939":"If secular liberals recognize that Osama bin Laden doesn't represent all Muslims, they should surely realize that Jerry Falwell doesn't represent all evangelicals.","394":"While Muslims' lives were clearly changed, also changed were the lives of people who had nothing to do with the Islamic world but who might appear alien to untutored American eyes. Indian women chose not to wear their flowing, pajama-tunic outfits. Sikh men, with their religiously prescribed beards and turbans, reported being accosted. They said they were apparently being mistaken as followers of Osama bin Laden, pictured on television with a turban of a different sort. In Providence, R.I., yesterday, a Sikh man in a turban was pulled off a Boston-to-Washington train by the police. In Richmond Hill, Queens, one Sikh man was beaten with a baseball bat; two others were shot at with a paint-ball gun. Police arrested two men.","3940":"Old ethnic, religious and political divides between terrorist groups were breaking down, the two men warned, posing an ominous new threat. They saw alliances among a wide range of Islamic terrorists, and theorized about a convergence of Sunni and Shiite extremist groups and secular Arab governments. Their conclusions, delivered to senior Bush administration officials, connected Iraq and Al Qaeda, Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.","3941":"The administration's dissatisfaction is not new, but the complaints have recently increased, as the American occupation seeks to rout rebels and transfer sovereignty to Iraqis on June 30. Officials say they are especially unhappy with broadcasts that focus on civilian casualties without providing the broader context of the war or give excessive time to the remarks of Osama bin Laden and other terrorists.","3942":"They believe that the attacks -- in Damascus, Syria; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and Amman, Jordan -- were the acts of terrorist cells that have been formed throughout the region in response to a call by Osama bin Laden, the founder of Al Qaeda, to rise up and strike the West and to the images of Americans killing Iraqis shown on television.","3943":"Sept. 11, 2001, was a turning point, neighbors said. Mr. Boschi hung a four-foot effigy of Osama bin Laden from his porch, and kept it there for nearly a year after the attacks. He tried to sign up for military service but was too old, Mr. Janul said. He had the impression that the American soldiers fighting overseas were doing it simply for the money, and not out of any true sense of mission, Mr. Janul said. 'It really bothered him,' he said.","3944":"It was an extraordinary coup: in the late 1990's, federal prosecutors sat down to interview their first major informer against Al Qaeda -- Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, a former payroll manager for Osama bin Laden who would become the government's chief witness in its first trial of Qaeda operatives.","3945":"Videotapes of conversations between the government and a former payroll manager for Osama bin Laden are inspiring defense lawyers to seek new trials for four men the witness helped convict of conspiring in terrorist acts. A1","3946":"Word of the attack quickly spawned gloating remarks on the Web sites that are the haunt of the supporters of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda. Although the attack could not immediately be tied to Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden and his assistants have called on Muslims to attack Americans and other Westerners wherever they find them.","3947":"But the problems began much earlier. We know now that the war being waged by Islamic fundamentalists against the United States began in 1983 with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and escalated through the African embassy bombings and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. As the enemy steadily escalated the fight, the C.I.A. needed to have operatives in the bazaars, teahouses and mosques of the Arab world, bribing, importuning and, if necessary, eliminating our enemies. Who doesn't wish we had killed Osama bin Laden in the late 1990's? But the rules on assassination were drawn to outlaw it in so-called peacetime. They were at war with us, and we convinced ourselves that we were not at war with them. Post-Church, we may have betrayed a fatal preference for clean hands in a dark world of terror in which only dirty hands can get the job done.","3948":"Terrorists like Osama bin Laden have always intended to use their violence to prod the United States and its allies into demonstrating that their worst anti-American propaganda was true. Abu Ghraib was an enormous victory for them, and it is unlikely that any response by the Bush administration will wipe its stain from the minds of Arabs. The invasion of Iraq, which has already begun to seem like a bad dream in so many ways, cannot get much more nightmarish than this.","3949":"A former Manhattan jail guard who was stabbed in the eye with a sharpened comb by a top aide to Osama bin Laden in 2000 was ejected from his attacker's sentencing hearing yesterday after he repeatedly shouted at the defendant and the judge. Dozens of his fellow correction officers walked out in protest from the hearing, at which the defendant was sentenced to 32 years in prison.","395":"AFGHANISTAN -- Fears grew in Afghanistan that the United States would attack the country for giving refuge to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding terror. Foreign aid workers, fearing retaliation if the United States did attack, began to leave.","3950":"The Walt Disney Company is blocking its Miramax division from distributing a new documentary by the filmmaker Michael Moore that highlights connections between President Bush and prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden. Executives at both companies cited concerns about its political content. A1","3951":"The film, 'Fahrenheit 911,' links Mr. Bush and prominent Saudis -- including the family of Osama bin Laden -- and criticizes Mr. Bush's actions before and after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","3952":"According to the indictment, Mr. Garnaoui returned to Germany from Afghanistan in January 2003 with orders from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, to carry out bomb attacks. He began recruiting Arab students and asylum seekers at Al Nur Mosque in the working-class neighborhood of Neuk\u00f6lln, setting up a sports club at the mosque, the indictment says. But the club's sessions were said to be classes in the concept of jihad, or Islamic holy war, and occasions for training in bomb-making and weapons use.","3953":"The documentary was prepared by Michael Moore, a controversial filmmaker who likes to skewer the rich and powerful. As described by Jim Rutenberg yesterday in The Times, the film, 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' links the Bush family with prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden. It describes financial ties that go back three decades and explores the role of the government in evacuating relatives of Mr. bin Laden from the United States shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The film was financed by Miramax and was expected to be released this summer.","3954":"A statement attributed to Osama bin Laden offered rewards in gold Thursday for the killing of top American and United Nations officials in Iraq. The transcript of a recording appeared on a Web site known for militant Islamic messages. The authenticity of the recording could not be verified. 'America promised big rewards for those who kill mujahedeen,' the transcript read. 'We in Al Qaeda will guarantee, God willing, 10,000 grams of gold to whoever kills the occupier Bremer, or the American chief commander or his deputy in Iraq,' referring to L. Paul Bremer III, the chief American administrator in Iraq, and top military officials. The statement promised the same reward for the deaths of Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, and his envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi.","3955":"But critics countered that the Treasury Department, which enforces economic sanctions, is already spending an inordinate amount of time on Cuba, largely in response to domestic political pressure. Of the 120 employees at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Senator Baucus said, 21 are dedicated to enforcing the Cuba embargo and only 4 to tracking the finances of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.","3956":"Thanks to the mess in Iraq -- including a continuing campaign of sabotage against oil pipelines -- oil exports have yet to recover to their prewar level, let alone supply the millions of extra barrels each day the optimists imagined. And the fallout from the war has spooked the markets, which now fear terrorist attacks on oil installations in Saudi Arabia, and are starting to worry about radicalization throughout the Middle East. (It has been interesting to watch people who lauded George Bush's leadership in the war on terror come to the belated realization that Mr. Bush has given Osama bin Laden exactly what he wanted.)","3957":"When the country is caught up in concern about the Iraqi prisoner abuse, will the public and official Washington ignore the fear of political extortion the Walt Disney Company felt about releasing the new Michael Moore film, which links the Bush family with prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden?","3958":"A 20-minute tape said to have been recorded by Osama bin Laden offered gold to anyone able to kill senior American and United Nations officials in Iraq or citizens of countries with troops there. The message appeared on two militant Islamic Web sites and could not immediately be authenticated, The A.P. reported.","3959":"I say 'timely' because I am in the process of reading both, and I find a curious difference in the way they report a certain incident. 'Ghost Wars' describes a discussion at the Clinton White House of the pros and cons of cruise missile attacks on hunting camps in Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden might have been. Despite his evident desire to 'get' bin Laden, Clarke is said to have argued against attacking a particular site partly because he was good friends with sheiks of the United Arab Emirates (whose camp this was), and they would also be at risk if present. Clarke had negotiated arms deals with the royal family in the United Arab Emirates, and was apparently concerned about an $8 billion military contract. 'If the United States bombed the camp and killed a few princes,' Coll writes, 'it could put all that in jeopardy.' The same attack is discussed in 'Against All Enemies,' but there Clarke makes no mention of these details.","396":"'At this time of the day, I usually have one or two shooters,' Mr. Keefe said at midmorning. 'Today I have eight. I had people who said, yeah, they would like to put up a picture of Osama bin Laden and go to work.'","3960":"What got us into this mess was the unnecessary invasion of Iraq, which played perfectly into the plans of Osama bin Laden.","3961":"A pivotal figure in the case is another Yemeni awaiting trial in Brooklyn, Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad. When the sheik was arrested last year in Germany, Attorney General John Ashcroft portrayed him as an important terrorism financier with close ties to Osama bin Laden. The sheik, who has been charged with financing terrorism, was later extradited to Brooklyn.","3962":"After two wars and three years, we still haven't gotten our hands on Osama bin Laden. Stellar performance? Afghanistan and Iraq are increasingly unstable. This is good?","3963":"American officials said the letter had been sent to the leadership of Al Qaeda, presumably Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, in Afghanistan. In the letter, the writer asked for assistance in trying to start a civil war in Iraq.","3964":"Commission officials, who face a July deadline for completing the panel's final report, have repeatedly sought access to Qaeda leaders captured since Sept. 11, especially Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and others close to Osama bin Laden who are believed to have been architects of the 2001 attacks.","3965":"But the American government might hold it against Arsenal that Osama bin Laden was reported to have been an Arsenal fan, attending several games when he was living in London in 1994. If that rules out an Arsenal purchase, another club that could interest the Americans might be Real Madrid of Spain, which last year acquired David Beckham, one of the few soccer stars who is well known in the United States.","3966":"After the attacks of Sept. 11, President Bush signed a series of directives authorizing the C.I.A. to conduct a covert war against Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network. The directives empowered the C.I.A. to kill or capture Qaeda leaders, but it is not clear whether the White House approved the specific rules for the interrogations.","3967":"Defeating international terrorists in 2004 is certainly a far more complex mission than defeating bank robbers in 1934. Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and their fellow travelers won't be stopped by better snipers or managers. Still, the challenge the F.B.I. faces today is much the same it confronted 70 years ago: finding a way to retool an underperforming government bureaucracy to combat an intimidating new danger to the public. The bureau did it to significant effect in 1934, and with luck, it will prove just as nimble again.","3968":"Intelligence is the lifeblood of America's war on terrorism, but many question our ability to manage it. How did we not know about those 19 hijackers? How could we have identified weapons stockpiles that didn't exist, overstated Qaeda ties to Saddam Hussein and misinterpreted Iraqi support for an American invasion? How could we have lost Osama bin Laden altogether?","3969":"'They asked me about Osama bin Laden,' he said. 'I said, 'I am Osama bin Laden but I am disguised.' '","397":"AFGHANISTAN -- Fears grew in Afghanistan that the United States would attack the country for giving refuge to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding terror. Foreign aid workers, fearing retaliation if the United States did attack, began to leave.","3970":"He is thought to have extensive ties across the militant Islamic movement and is considered an ally of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader. A letter that the American authorities said had been written by Mr. Zarqawi and that they released in March claims his responsibility for some 25 bombings in Iraq.","3971":"Dr. Post, 70, the director of George Washington University's political psychology program, consults privately for the Department of Homeland Security and for Pentagon counterterrorism officials. In his view, the world's most dangerous leaders are often malignant narcissists, a category that he says he thinks includes Osama bin Laden, Kim Jong Il of North Korea and Hitler.","3972":"American importers of gum arabic last faced a crisis several years ago when Osama bin Laden, who lived in Sudan in the 1990's, was linked to the industry. A State Department official said there is no indication that such a connection currently exists.","3973":"Although Mr. Moussaoui has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy.","3974":"According to General Laanigri, Osama bin Laden authorized Mr. Gerbouzi to open a training camp for Moroccans in Afghanistan in the beginning of 2001. Last December, Mr. Gerbouzi was tried in absentia in Morocco for his involvement in the Casablanca attacks and given a 20-year sentence.","3975":"Even more troubling is the notion that terrorists are learning to exploit the opportunities offered by the sea. The bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, and the possibility that some involved in the attack on the World Trade Center entered the United States by ship, are just two examples. It has even been alleged, Langewiesche reports, that Osama bin Laden has his own fleet of freighters that authorities have so far been powerless to track down. In 2001, intelligence sources indicated that a ship containing a large chemical bomb was on its way to London. The threat never materialized, but the potential for an oceanic equivalent of 9/11 certainly exists. As Langewiesche reminds us, Halifax, Nova Scotia, came close to being obliterated back in 1917 when a French munitions ship collided with a Norwegian freighter and exploded: 'Witnesses said that the sky erupted in a cubic mile of flame, and for the blink of an eye the harbor bottom went dry. More than 1,630 buildings were completely destroyed, another 12,000 were damaged, and more than 1,900 people died.'","3976":"Which leaves us with Tepperman's most egregious sin of all, a sin of omission. For my thesis to hold up, he argues, I would have to show that President Bush has given Saudi Arabia a 'pass' and overlooked the kingdom's support for Islamic terror. I answer this question with the first account of the Saudi evacuation from the United States that began when American airspace was still restricted. At the time, we knew that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudi, that Osama bin Laden was Saudi, that Saudis played a key role in the funding of Al Qaeda. One of the most basic investigative procedures in any murder is to interrogate relatives and associates of the perpetrator. Yet the Bush White House allowed at least eight planes to pick up roughly 140 Saudis in 12 American cities. One Saudi in the evacuation allegedly had advance knowledge of 9/11. Why did the White House let them leave the country largely unquestioned? The logical conclusion is that the White House weighed the relative merits of doing a favor for wealthy Saudis versus getting to the bottom of America's greatest national security disaster and came down in favor of the Saudis.","3977":"Though they once harbored Osama bin Laden, the country's Islamic leaders rooted out the Al Qaeda leadership in the late 1990's and reached out to the United States after Sept. 11. The administration then encouraged Sudan to negotiate an end to decades of civil war with black Christians in the south whose suffering had captured the sympathies of American churchgoers.","3978":"'They asked, 'Do you know the Islamic opposition?'' Mr. Aboud recalled in an interview in Baghdad. 'I said yes.' At one point, Mr. Aboud said: 'They asked me about Osama bin Laden. I said, 'I am Osama bin Laden. I am disguised.''","3979":"The Michael Moore documentary the Walt Disney Company deemed too partisan to distribute offers few new revelations about the connections between President Bush and prominent Saudi Arabian families, including that of Osama bin Laden.","3980":"'I am concerned about Osama bin Laden,' Mr. Cummings said at the Kerry rally. 'I am concerned about the terrorists. But ladies and gentlemen, the greatest threat to our national security is our failure to educate our children.'","3981":"Our clients were repeatedly shown a video that their interrogators claimed pictured them with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. They denied it and said they were in England at the time. They were put in solitary for three months, subjected to repeated interrogations for as long as 12 hours while forced to squat without a chair, their hands chained between their legs and chained to the floor. Strobe lighting was used and loud music played. They said that on occasion, dogs were brought in to frighten them. Eventually, they confessed.","3982":"Already the backlash has begun. Americans are being warned against indulging in an orgy of self-condemnation. The continuing publication of the pictures is being taken by many Americans as suggesting that we do not have the right to defend ourselves: after all, they (the terrorists) started it. They -- Osama bin Laden? Saddam Hussein? what's the difference? -- attacked us first. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, before which Secretary Rumsfeld testified, avowed that he was sure he was not the only member of the committee 'more outraged by the outrage' over the photographs than by what the photographs show. 'These prisoners,' Senator Inhofe explained, 'you know they're not there for traffic violations. If they're in Cellblock 1-A or 1-B, these prisoners, they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands, and here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals.' It's the fault of 'the media' which are provoking, and will continue to provoke, further violence against Americans around the world. More Americans will die. Because of these photos.","3984":"'The Iraq War' immortalizes a 'brief and brilliant' campaign led by American and British troops, who receive equal attention here; this is not a book to neglect the role of the Queen's Royal Lancers. Unfortunately, as Mr. Keegan acknowledges in a coda titled 'The War's Aftermath,' there have been some unanticipated problems since the campaign's happy ending. But by and large his emphasis is on successful strategy, and he hovers in a strange limbo between immediacy and hindsight. 'At the culmination of the campaign,' he writes, 'it was believed that Osama bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind, had been cornered and killed. Later evidence, supplied by video and broadcast tape, dashed such hopes.'","3985":"The Mayfields denied having any contact with Mr. Seda, Mr. Mayfield's lawyers said, and said they had never heard of him. The affidavit also said Mr. Mayfield's law firm, a family and immigration law practice in Beaverton, Ore., advertised in a 'Muslim yellow page directory,' which was produced by a man who had business dealings with Osama bin Laden's former personal secretary. The directory was administered by Jerusalem Enterprises, Inc., which was registered to Farid Adlouni, a Portland resident who the documents said was 'directly linked in business dealings' with Wadih El-Hage, the former bin Laden secretary whom a New York federal court convicted of conspiring to murder American citizens.","3986":"In general, said a senior Army officer who served in Iraq, many of the prisoners held in the isolation wing at Abu Ghraib were kept there long beyond any period of usefulness because 'no one wanted to be responsible for releasing the next Osama bin Laden.'","3987":"The United States has a special interest in Sudan, which was home to Osama bin Laden in the early 1990's and was designated a 'state sponsor of terrorism.'","3988":"'Hamza is the real deal,' he said. 'He is suspected of providing material support to trainees in Osama bin Laden's terrorist camps, as well as dispatching associates from England to help establish a jihad training site on U.S. soil. Think of him as a freelance consultant to terrorist groups worldwide.'","3989":"'Whether it is Mr. Zawahiri or Osama bin Laden, I don't know that,' he said, referring to Mr. bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. 'But certainly a foreigner, non-Pakistani is involved. And then, they hire a Pakistani extremist, who then gets the money, the support and then he picks up a team who execute the plan.'","399":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 12\u2014 The hijackers who commandeered commercial jets that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were followers of Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant who has been blamed for some of the bloodiest attacks against Americans, federal authorities said today.","3990":"Abderraouf Jdey, a Tunisian with Canadian citizenship, who was seen on videotaped messages found in Afghanistan at the home of Mohammed Atef, a military lieutenant to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Jdey's last known residence was in Montreal.","3991":"A British-born Australian admitted to conspiring to blow up the Israeli Embassy in Canberra in 2000, changing his plea in the middle of a trial that heard details of his links to Al Qaeda and the Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. In nine days of trial, the court heard of a trip the defendant, Jack Roche, above, a 50-year-old Muslim convert, made to Afghanistan via Pakistan in March 2000, when he also received explosives training at a Qaeda camp. Mr. Roche said that he had briefly met Osama bin Laden and that his Qaeda contact in Pakistan had been Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks who is now in American custody. He said that he had been sent to Pakistan by the Indonesian terror leader known as Hambali and that the attack on the embassy was called off on the order of Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian cleric. Mr. Roche was arrested in November 2002 amid heightened security concerns. He faces up to 25 years in prison.","3993":"Earlier this year, the United States military increased its forces in Afghanistan to 20,000, from roughly 15,000. American military officials have said that their mission is to enhance security against Taliban fighters and Al Qaeda members, including Osama bin Laden.","3994":"But some facts have been established. For instance, it is known that followers of Osama bin Laden have in the past slipped into the United States quietly, like the Sept. 11 hijackers. Moreover, captured high-level Qaeda associates have said that important associates of Mr. bin Laden, like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, sent operatives to the United States to scout potential targets.","3995":"A group affiliated with Al Qaeda, the network whose founder Osama bin Laden has vowed to disrupt the close ties between the kingdom and the West, took responsibility for the attack through an unsubstantiated claim on a Web site associated with the militants. It threatened to drive all 'crusaders' from 'the land of Islam.' In a taped statement posted on Islamist Web sites, Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, a reputed leader of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, promised that the coming months would be 'bloody and miserable for infidels.'","3996":"We knew that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudis. We knew that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi, was behind 9/11. Yet we did not conduct a police-style investigation of the departing Saudis, of whom two dozen were members. of the bin Laden family. That is not to say that they were complicit in the attacks.","3997":"Government prosecutors said they were prepared to present evidence that at least some of the defendants had direct contacts with Osama bin Laden, had trained in Qaeda military camps in Afghanistan and had received $150,000 from the terrorist network to carry out the attacks. The accused ringleaders of the cell, however, have not been captured.","3998":"'These entities and this individual have provided financial, material and logistical support to the Al Qaeda network, Osama bin Laden or the Taliban, fueling and facilitating their efforts to carry out vile acts against innocent individuals and the civilized world,' said Juan Zarate, a deputy assistant treasury secretary.","3999":"The Democrats' aggressiveness in this debate is, in large part, a reaction to 2002, strategists close to the campaign say. The Democrats' vulnerability on national security that year, one year after the terrorist attacks, was embodied by the Senate race in Georgia. Max Cleland, a triple amputee who earned a silver star in Vietnam, lost that seat to Saxby Chambliss after a lacerating Republican advertising campaign that used footage of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden to accuse Mr. Cleland of being soft on defense.","4":"Waking up in the year 2000 to face nothing worse than the debris in Times Square, some may have decided that Washington had hyped the prospect of an attack by Osama bin Laden and his allies beyond reason.","40":"Today, some of those same warriors have shifted the focus of their battle to India and America. Among them is Osama bin Laden, whom the United States considers responsible for bombing two of its embassies in 1998. Mr. bin Laden's name will surely come up in the talks between Mr. Clinton and General Musharraf on Saturday. Mr. bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan, with the ruling Taliban militia as his host. Washington has been disappointed in Pakistan's reluctance to use its influence with the Taliban to press for Mr. bin Laden's expulsion or arrest.","400":"To that end, the administration today began to apply pressure to Pakistan, a country that has been accused of providing support for Osama bin Laden and giving his militant Islamic organization the freedom to operate. The director of the Pakistani Interservices Intelligence, Gen. Mahmoud Ahmad, who happened to be here on a regular visit of consultations, was called into the State Department today to meet with Deputy Secretary Richard L. Armitage.","4000":"The staff report also held that the agencies might have changed the course of history if they had produced a national intelligence estimate -- an authoritative document put together by all the federal intelligence services to give the president and his national security team an overall assessment of a specific threat -- on the Osama bin Laden network.","4001":"The authorities released an Afghan journalist employed by Newsweek after holding him in secret detention for six weeks, the press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said. The Afghan, Sami Yousafzai, was arrested April 21 in Pakistan's tribal areas while working with an American freelance writer for The New Yorker. Pakistani officials bar foreign journalists from entering the tribal areas, where hundreds of foreign militants -- including possibly Osama bin Laden -- are believed to be hiding. The American, Eliza Griswold, was expelled several days after their arrest. The group said the Pakistani driver used by the journalists, Mohamed Salim, was still being held in secret detention.

Her heroine, Olivia Joules, falls for an aristocratic-looking foreigner who just might be Osama bin Laden! As Olivia (she of the overactive imagination) sees it, Pierre Feramo is not the French face-cream tycoon/movie producer/international playboy that he says he is. Instead, she thinks to herself, he is the Al Qaeda mastermind, hiding in plain sight among the beautiful and botoxed in Beverly Hills and South Beach.","4003":"It is those programs that the next director of central intelligence will have to focus on even while tracking Osama bin Laden and the Iraqi insurgency and remaking an institution that has clearly not yet transformed itself. Perhaps that is why Mr. Tenet has told friends he held 'the best job in government and the toughest job in government.'","4004":"George J. Tenet was determined to see Osama bin Laden in American custody. Now, with Mr. Tenet's resignation as director of central intelligence, the international terrorist has outlasted him.","4005":"But he compared the setback to those experienced after World War II in occupied Japan and Germany. 'It's always been a tough path from a dictatorship to a representative system,' he said. The defense secretary was asked how close the United States authorities were to capturing Osama bin Laden. He expressed confidence that the terrorist leader would be caught, although he conceded that the task was more difficult than catching Saddam Hussein, given the differences in terrain and the inability of American intelligence to penetrate Mr. bin Laden's inner circle.","4006":"'Numerous transactions that may be indicative of terrorist financing and money laundering have been observed' moving through the Syrian bank's accounts, according to a Treasury Department document, adding that the transfers include several transactions 'that reference a reputed financier for Osama bin Laden.'","4007":"As Mr. Tenet bid a sad farewell to his colleagues at the Central Intelligence Agency last week, it was hard to recall the last time a Washington spy master stepped down in triumph -- or, for that matter, the last time the nation celebrated the achievements of the C.I.A. The closest thing to a rousing success in recent years was the agency's clandestine role in the 1980's in evicting Soviet forces from Afghanistan -- though that operation inadvertently laid the groundwork for the rise of Osama bin Laden -- and the capture or killing of top Al Qaeda leaders since Sept. 11, 2001.","4009":"Osama bin Laden and his followers have vowed to undermine the Saudi government, which they loathe for allying itself with the United States.","401":"The authorities have not determined what help the hijackers might have had from people living in the Boston area. The militant Islamic leader Osama bin Laden, who has vowed a holy war against the United States, has ties to some people in this region who federal investigators believe were part of a terrorist cell.","4010":"Instead, the Taliban have regrouped in Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden remains a rallying figure for Islamic terrorists, whose numbers have grown because of worldwide outrage among Muslims at what is happening in Iraq.","4011":"A brash 27-year-old Taliban fighter named Nek Muhammad is the talk of the town in this famed border city, long a haven for adventurers, rogues and revolutionaries. His defiance raises a central question in the American-led drive against terrorism: is President Pervez Musharraf doing all he can to hunt down Osama bin Laden?","4012":"The new attacks come in the aftermath of a Pakistani military offensive in March that failed to find hundreds of foreign militants, including possibly Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be hiding in the rugged tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. Militants have warned that any new army operation in the tribal areas will result in attacks in major Pakistani cities.","4013":"Among the issues not raised is his effective creation of Osama bin Laden, through the arming of the Afghan mujahedeen against the Soviets. Should we not remember this action now as we remember the man's legacy?","4014":"A federal judge ruled yesterday that two declarations by Osama bin Laden calling for war against Americans may be used as evidence in the trial of Lynne F. Stewart, a lawyer accused of aiding terrorism. The decision was a setback to defense efforts to dissociate her case from Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11 attacks.","4017":"The Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, stepped up military operations in the area after he narrowly survived two assassination attempts last December believed to have been ordered by Al Qaeda. Hundreds of foreign militants, including Osama bin Laden, are believed to be hiding there.","4018":"Hundreds of foreign militants, possibly including Osama bin Laden, are thought to be hiding in the area and carrying out cross-border attacks on American forces in Afghanistan and terrorists attacks in Pakistan.","4019":"That is an understatement. Until this assignment, Swift's clients consisted mostly of fellow servicemen accused of crimes like drug use and sexual harassment. He is currently defending a Yemeni man who worked as Osama bin Laden's driver in Afghanistan.","402":"Law enforcement agencies were also looking at other potential suspects in the area. The Daytona police said one man was questioned and had his car impounded. The car had a photograph of a Middle Eastern leader, thought incorrectly to be Osama bin Laden. The police said the man was released and is not a suspect at this time.","4020":"In 'Militant's Defiance Puts Pakistan's Resolve in Doubt' (news article, June 10), you say that some Washington officials 'have privately expressed concern that Pakistan is backtracking in the hunt for' Osama bin Laden. But on the same day that some Bush administration officials made that allegation, June 9, Pakistan launched a coordinated military operation against inimical elements associated with the terrorist groups in South Waziristan, as was widely reported in the American press.","4021":"The posting includes both a written threat from the group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- which is believed to be inspired by Osama bin Laden's terror network, rather than an official arm of it -- and a videotaped recording echoing the same Friday deadline by Abdelaziz al-Muqrin, the self-proclaimed leader of the group.","4022":"Judge Garz\u00f3n has charged and issued international arrest warrants for 16 others suspected of being members the of the network. He has also issued a warrant for Osama bin Laden.","4023":"Representative Rush Holt, a Democrat from New Jersey who has sponsored several measures on language education in the House, recalled meeting with Special Forces soldiers who had been involved in the futile hunt for Osama bin Laden. None, Mr. Holt said, was fluent in Pashto, the primary language along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.","4024":"The commission described for the first time a 1999 meeting in which Osama bin Laden confided to his lieutenant, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, that his long-discussed proposal to use aircraft as weapons had the full support of Al Qaeda. A1","4025":"These excerpts reproduce the name spellings in the 9/11 commission's report. The New York Times renders some names differently. They include the following: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, Walid Ba'Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Khalid al-Midhar, Ziad al-Jarrah, Marwan al-Shehhi and Nawaq Alhazmi.","4026":"Also indicted is Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born founder of the Qaeda terror network. Judge Garz\u00f3n has argued that Spain has jurisidiction over Mr. bin Laden and other Qaeda members because the Sept. 11 attacks were planned on Spanish soil.","4027":"Mr. Moussaoui attended Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, and the commission said Osama bin Laden and Mr. Mohammed sent him to Malaysia in 2000 to obtain pilot training. Mr. Moussaoui came to the United States in February 2001, taking flight training classes first in Oklahoma and then in Minnesota. He was arrested Aug. 16, 2001, on an immigration violation after his flight instructors reported that he had been acting suspiciously.","4028":"Hundreds of foreign militants are believed to be hiding in the Pakistani tribal areas; there are suspicions that Osama bin Laden may be among them. Some Pakistani political analysts and Afghan officials accuse Pakistan's ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, of moving too slowly to eradicate militancy. They say the general tries to protect some militants in order to use them to put pressure on Pakistan's archrival, India.","4029":"The chronology, based on the panel's review of highly classified accounts of interrogations of captured Qaeda leaders, shows that Osama bin Laden was far more intimately involved in the planning of the attacks than previously known and approved the selection of each of the 19 hijackers. It also shows that the original plot called for attacks that would have been even larger and more deadly.","403":"All of those principles were at work when the Clinton administration struck at Osama bin Laden, the architect of the 1998 bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the suspected sponsor of the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","4030":"The commission's report did not specifically address that distinction or Mr. Zarqawi's role. It found that an Iraqi intelligence officer met with Osama bin Laden in Sudan in 1994, but that Iraq never responded to Mr. bin Laden's subsequent request for space to set up training camps and help in buying weapons. It said there were reports of later contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda, but 'they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship.'","4032":"'I think the commission has been unfairly criticized,' said Carolee Azzarello of Greenbrook, N.J., whose brothers, Tim and John Grazioso, died in the attacks. 'I think some people want the commission to give them something on a platter, to say, these people are to blame, someone to point a finger at. For me, the person to point the finger at is Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Those are the people who killed my brothers.'","4033":"In early 1999, Osama bin Laden summoned Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to his well-guarded compound in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to confide to the lieutenant that his long-discussed proposal to use aircraft as terror weapons against the United States had the full support of Al Qaeda.","4034":"The staff report issued by the 9/11 panel says that Sudan's government, which sheltered Osama bin Laden in the early 1990's, tried to hook him up with Mr. Hussein, but that nothing came of it.","4035":"At Wednesday's hearing, at least one commissioner, Fred F. Fielding, wondered aloud about how trustworthy Mr. Mohammed's information was, declaring, 'Our concern is that while there's some that can be verified, there are other areas where it certainly could be a source of disinformation for whatever reason.' The disagreements are nuanced, but significant. Not all counterterrorism officials believe, for example, that Osama bin Laden exercised the kind of command over the Sept. 11 operation that is described in the report released Wednesday. In part, the officials said, they suspect that the captured Qaeda figures have a strong desire to play down their own roles and have been willing to make it appear that Mr. bin Laden was the dominant figure in an effort to enhance his stature.","4036":"The report said there might have been contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden moved to Afghanistan in 1996, 'but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship.'","4037":"The staff has been critical of the Clinton administration, too, pointing out missed opportunities in the late 1990's, when that White House shied from what might have been opportunities to kill or capture Osama bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda.","4038":"'Afghanistan is no longer a terrorist factory sending thousands of killers into the world,' President Bush announced on Tuesday, as he stood in the White House Rose Garden next to his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai. And, true, Afghanistan has been a success story, at least compared with Iraq. Still, the offensive against militants who fled into northwestern Pakistan continues, and Osama bin Laden remains on the lam. Achieving lasting peace and democracy in this trouble spot will take more than Special Operations troops -- we must gain a far better understanding of the militants and their motivations.","4039":"Much of the information and many of the theories in Mr. Bamford's book will be familiar to readers from earlier magazine and newspaper articles, and other books: most notably, Bob Woodward's 'Bush at War' and 'Plan of Attack;' 'Ghost Wars,' Steve Coll's exhaustive history of the C.I.A., Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan; the former counterterrorism czar Richard A. Clarke's best-selling expos\u00e9 of the war on terror, 'Against All Enemies;' and 'Inside 9-11,' a detailed chronicle of the terrorist attacks of 2001 by Der Spiegel journalists.","404":"Q. Mr. President, how confident are you that Osama bin Laden is behind these attacks? Do you know what his whereabouts are? And, secondly, what kind of support are you looking for from Congress, in terms of your willingness to act?","4040":"The bipartisan 10-member commission has tried to bring its investigation full circle by focusing this week on the details of the attack plot, how it was conceived by Osama bin Laden and his terror network and how the White House, the military and other government agencies responded on the morning of Sept. 11.","4041":"Speaking of the commission, he said, 'They did not address the broader question of a relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda in other areas, in other ways.' He said 'the evidence is overwhelming.' He described the ties and cited numerous links back to the 1990's, including contacts between Osama bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence officials.","4042":"The government has charged 69 people in the bombings, which it said were planned by Turkish militants who were in contact with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.","4043":"The new account, based on 19 months of staff work, asserts flatly that there is 'no evidence' that the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials financed the group, which is led by Osama bin Laden.","4044":"The book is sprawling, undisciplined and idiosyncratic in its choice of emphasis. It devotes nearly 100 pages to his childhood but treats large spans of his presidency as a travelogue of campaign cities and foreign capitals. Mr. Clinton wrote his book after the Sept. 11 attacks, and he devotes a good deal of space to his administration's efforts to deal with terrorism, and its growing concern about Osama bin Laden.","4045":"When former Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified before the 9/11 commission, he discussed the Clinton administration's rationale for the 1998 bombing of the pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. He said that there was intelligence that Osama bin Laden had put money into 'this military industrial corporation; that the owner of the plant had traveled to Baghdad to meet with the father of the VX program.'","4046":"When the commission studying the 9/11 terrorist attacks refuted the Bush administration's claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, we suggested that President Bush apologize for using these claims to help win Americans' support for the invasion of Iraq. We did not really expect that to happen. But we were surprised by the depth and ferocity of the administration's capacity for denial. President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have not only brushed aside the panel's findings and questioned its expertise, but they are also trying to rewrite history.","4047":"Mr. Cheney also said in the television interview that after Osama bin Laden had requested 'terror training from Iraq, the Iraqi intelligence service responded; it deployed a bomb-making expert, a brigadier general.' The commission's report concluded that Mr. bin Laden's requests went unanswered.","4048":"We have captured Saddam Hussein, who rebuffed or ignored requests for help from Qaeda leaders, but Osama bin Laden, who was far more involved in the planning of the Sept. 11 attacks than was previously known, remains alive and active.","4049":"'Somewhere along the line he might have been directly working with Osama bin Laden,' one Western analyst said. Yet Mr. Muqrin's group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is viewed as more of a franchise operation than a subsidiary of Mr. bin Laden's operations. While the group was inspired by the Qaeda goal of toppling the Saudi royal family and fighting the West, analysts said it was not acting under Mr. bin Laden's direct orders.","405":"'Bury Osama bin Laden with a pigskin, donate blood for the people in New York and God bless this great country,' he said.","4050":"That was Afghanistan in the 1980's. It became a breeding ground for terrorists -- most infamously Osama bin Laden -- who exported their deadly skills throughout the world. In Iraq, some of the same conditions that nurtured terrorism in the mountains of Afghanistan have emerged in the power vacuum created by the American occupation, Iraqis and terrorism experts say.","4051":"When Olivia is sent to Miami to cover the debut of a supermodel's face cream, she finds herself attracted to the exotic Pierre Feramo, despite her suspicion that he belongs to Al Qaeda. Pierre sort of resembles Osama bin Laden -- her best friend calls him Osama bin Feramo -- but he's generous with flattery and Cristal, and Olivia simply can't decide. Let's just say he's no Mr. Darcy.","4052":"Osama bin Laden was actively involved. Mr. bin Laden had been previously depicted as relatively removed from the details of Al Qaeda's operations. In fact, prior to the defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan, one report said, 'bin Laden approved all Al Qaeda operations, often selecting the targets and operatives.'In the case of Sept. 11, he approved the selection of all 19 hijackers and ordered the attacks over the opposition of many of his advisers and of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader in Afghanistan.","4053":"'Outrageously false,' said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, last month when told about the film's assertion of a sinister connection between Mr. Bush and the family of Osama bin Laden. The former president George H. W. Bush was quoted in The New York Daily News calling Mr. Moore a 'slime ball' and describing the documentary as 'a vicious personal attack on our son.'","4054":"Mr. Clinton confesses that his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky was 'immoral and foolish,' but he spends far more space excoriating his nemesis, the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, and the press. He writes at length about his awareness that terrorism was a growing threat, but does not grapple with the unintended consequences of his administration's decisions to pressure Sudan to expel Osama bin Laden in 1996 (driving the Qaeda leader to Afghanistan, where he was harder to track) or to launch cruise missile attacks against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for the embassy bombings in 1998 (an act that some terrorism experts believe fueled terrorists' conviction that the United States was an ineffectual giant that relied on low-risk high technology).","4055":"It remains somewhat murky what links might exist between Osama bin Laden and those operating within Saudi Arabia, which so far seem to be following his general plan rather than acting on direct orders. Mr. Muqrin was among the few leaders believed to have spent time with Mr. bin Laden at training camps in Afghanistan.","4057":"Born in Bahrain, he grew up in Toronto and Afghanistan, where his Egyptian-born father, Ahmed Said Khadr, became a close associate of Osama bin Laden.","4058":"Officials said the intelligence had allowed them to piece together a more detailed picture of Al Qaeda before Sept. 11, 2001, including how young jihadis were recruited and screened, how the organization moved funds and how it related to other militant groups. They said some were important Qaeda operatives, including financiers, a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden and -- a recent discovery -- a militant who they say helped recruit 9/11 hijackers.","4059":"A book by the senior Central Intelligence Agency officer who headed an office that tracked Osama bin Laden warns that the United States is losing the war against radical Islam. A12","406":"AFGHANISTAN -- Radio Shariat said the Taliban was ready to hand over Osama bin Laden to 'one of the Islamic courts of the world' if Washington could prove his involvement in the attacks in the United States. More than 100 foreign aid workers left in anticipation of a possible American military strike.","4060":"A new book by the senior Central Intelligence Agency officer who headed a special office to track Osama bin Laden and his followers warns that the United States is losing the war against radical Islam and that the invasion of Iraq has only played into the enemy's hands.","4061":"A co-defendant in the trial of Lynne F. Stewart, a lawyer accused of aiding terrorism, worked with an associate of Osama bin Laden to draft an October 2000 call to Muslims worldwide to fight Jews and 'kill them wherever they are,' the defendant's lawyer acknowledged yesterday in court.","4062":"Contacts between Iraqi intelligence agents and Osama bin Laden when he was in Sudan in the mid-1990's were part of a broad effort by Baghdad to work with organizations opposing the Saudi ruling family, according to a newly disclosed document obtained by the Americans in Iraq.","4063":"Mr. Zarqawi is steeped in Islamic militant traditions. In his teens, he fought Soviet troops in Afghanistan, where it is thought he met Osama bin Laden.","4064":"Contacts between Iraqi intelligence agents and Osama bin Laden in the 1990's were part of an effort by Baghdad to work with organizations opposing the Saudi ruling family. A1","4065":"AL QAEDA LINK -- A document obtained by American officials in Iraq indicates that contacts between Iraqi intelligence agents and Osama bin Laden when he was in Sudan in the mid-1990's were part of a Baghdad effort to work with opponents of the Saudi rulers. A request from Mr. bin Laden for joint operations went unanswered. [A1]","4066":"And in January, American forces found a letter believed to have been written by Mr. Zarqawi to Al Qaeda leaders hiding on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It requested aid in fighting the Shiites of Iraq: 'You, gracious brothers, are the leaders, guides and symbolic figures of jihad and battle. We do not see ourselves as fit to challenge you if you are convinced of the idea of fighting the sects of apostasy; we will be your readied soldiers.' The tone of the letter is clearly that of someone outside Al Qaeda appealing for its help. And Al Qaeda's leaders seem little interested in fomenting a Sunni-Shiite civil war in Iraq; in the audiotapes he has released in the past year, Osama bin Laden has made no mention of the Shiites.","4067":"A sleepy-eyed American right off an airplane could see in the morning paper photos showing that an English player, John Terry, had obstructed the Portuguese goalkeeper while a teammate, Sol Campbell, headed the ball into the net. But this being England, which ground to a predictable halt Thursday night as a 38-year quest for a major soccer title continued unfulfilled, Urs Meier might as well have been Osama bin Laden, plotting England's demise from his cave.","4068":"The legal memo was prepared after an internal debate within the government about the methods used to extract information from Abu Zubaydah, one of Osama bin Laden's top aides, after his capture in April 2002, the officials said. The memo provided a legal foundation for coercive techniques used later against other high-ranking detainees, like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, believed to be the chief architect of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, who was captured in early 2003.","4069":"It will take more creativity than this for the administration to distract us from the 9/11 commission, which is refuting Mr. Ashcroft and company's absurd claims to pre-9/11 battle-readiness as firmly as it shot down Mr. Moore's account of the post-9/11 airlifting of bin Laden relatives. A lot is at stake in a re-election campaign. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that in just two months Mr. Bush has lost his entire 21-point advantage as the most-trusted leader in fighting terrorism; capturing Saddam can't give America a bye forever for failing to nab Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar and the anthrax perpetrators. Mr. Ashcroft's well-worn shtick also has its limits; his cases against presumed terrorists keep evaporating in and out of court. Meanwhile, just a week before the 9/11 commission staff reports were surfacing, the Capitol had to be evacuated when the Federal Aviation Agency failed to notify Washington air defense of a plane's approach in restricted air space during the heightened alert of the Reagan funeral.","407":"The Bush administration singles out Osama bin Laden as the force behind the terror attacks on New York and Washington, and it vows a comprehensive military campaign to demolish terror networks and topple the regimes that harbor them. A1","4070":"Ever since President Bush set his sights on war, many Americans have looked around the world and wondered if Iraq was really the worst problem out there. North Korea, and probably Iran, are the countries busily creating nuclear weapons in defiance of international law. Sudanese leaders worked closely with Osama bin Laden and slaughter their people as callously as Saddam Hussein did. Pakistan has provided nuclear weapons technology and fuel to rogue nations.","4071":"It is a tough burden for a man who many Britons secretly suspect is 'as likely to win Wimbledon as Osama bin Laden,' as The Daily Express wrote two years ago.","4072":"Already, two hostages seized in Iraq have been decapitated, on video, by insurgents connected to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian fugitive suspected of masterminding a bombing campaign that has killed hundreds of people. In recent weeks, he has emerged as the brutal new terror boss in Iraq, though it is not clear if he is linked to other groups like Al Qaeda or is operating on his own. Some intelligence officers have even said Mr. Zarqawi may be a rival, not an ally, of Osama bin Laden.","4073":"Lefties have been asking me whether Mr. Bush has already captured Osama bin Laden, and whether Mr. Bush will plant W.M.D. in Iraq. Those are the questions of a conspiracy theorist, for even if officials wanted to pull such stunts, they would be daunted by the fear of leaks.","4074":"Here are some things that her new book, 'Inside the Kingdom,' reports about him: that he was tall. Commanding. Stern. Intimidating. 'When Osama stepped into the room, you felt it,' she says, although apparently she did not see him stepping into rooms very often. Osama bin Laden (family spellings of the last name vary) was a very distant relative by marriage. She had 23 other brothers-in-law, too.","4075":"ACCURACY: Most of the claims are straightforward. While Mr. Kerry does have two daughters and three stepsons, the decades-old photograph evokes a stage of fathering that is out of date. He has a pilot's license but never flew for anything other than fun. 'Tough prosecutor' and 'advocate for kids' are subjective evaluations; Mr. Kerry is better known during his years in the district attorney's office for reorganizing the staff, and, in his Senate tenure, for investigating Iran-contra and other scandals, not for creating children's programs. In terms of his 'strategy to win the war on terror,' the commercial showcases Mr. Kerry's 1997 book, 'The New War: The Web of Crime That Threatens America's Security.' The book predates what we now think of as the war on terror; much of the seven-point plan his campaign cites as backup for the advertisement's claim was devised after the book's publication. The book does not mention Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda, and The New Republic wrote recently that it 'was almost entirely focused on the threat of global crime, not terrorism' and viewed 'post-cold war security more as a matter for law enforcement than the military.'","4076":"The Parliament rejected a bill that would have allowed the government to prevent parents from naming their children Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein and any other name it deemed 'harmful to public order.' It was the second time the government had tried to pass the measure. 'Only the parents have the right to name their newborns and nobody else,' one lawmaker said.","4077":"There is a sound basis for the concern. The U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq has been a gift-wrapped, gilt-edged recruiting tool for Al Qaeda and its offshoots. If Osama bin Laden had personally designed a campaign to expand the ranks and spread the influence of anti-American terrorists, it's hard to imagine him coming up with a better scenario than the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.","4079":"THE SCRIPT: Mr. Bush says, 'I'm George W. Bush and I approve this message.' An announcer says, 'John Kerry says he's 'author of a strategy to win the war on terror'? Against the Japanese Yakuza. Never mentions Al Qaeda. Says nothing about Osama bin Laden. Calls Yasir Arafat a 'statesman.' The New Republic says Kerry's plan 'misses the mark.' And Kerry's focus? Global crime, not terrorism. How can John Kerry win a war if he doesn't know the enemy?'","408":"Such a campaign could involve American forces in protracted fighting against a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and even Pakistan, which occupies a vital strategic position south of Afghanistan, where the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden is believed to be based.","4080":"A statement issued in the name of an obscure group claiming ties to Al Qaeda warned of terrorist attacks in Europe over the coming months, newspapers reported Friday. The statement said the attacks would begin after a 'truce' offered by Osama bin Laden earlier this year expires in two weeks.","4081":"Right after the 2001 terror attacks, Imam Sherzad condemned the Taliban, who were helping to hide Osama bin Laden, and accused foundation members of supporting, doing business with and funneling mosque contributions to Taliban leaders. He also blamed them for a speech at the mosque given years ago by the Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind fundamentalist Muslim serving a life sentence for conspiring to blow up New York landmarks.","4082":"Afghanistan, he said, risked 'falling back under the Taliban,' the authoritarian, fundamentalist regime that provided a haven for Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, until the United States overthrew it after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","4083":"A statement issued in the name of an obscure group claiming ties to Al Qaeda warned of terrorist attacks in Europe over the coming months, after a 'truce' offered by Osama bin Laden earlier this year expires in two weeks. A5","4085":"Plenty of roadside-stand or fireworks-shop customers still just pick up an 'assortment box,' but the more selective sort through rows of garish packages that change from year to year. In 2002 and 2003, Heckman says, names like Uncle Sam's Answer or Let Freedom Rain became popular, as did exploding Osama bin Laden fireworks. Some of these are still around and appear calculated to seem not just pro-American but also pro-War on Terror. In any case, this is where the patriotism figures in. (The vast majority of the fireworks, including the most prominent brands, are of course from China; one online seller even lists a product marked 'America's Pride -- Made in China.' Apparently we really are offshoring everything.)","4086":"Individual conscience by itself has never had significance vis-\u00e0-vis church teaching. Osama bin Laden and multitudes of other murderers are at peace with their consciences, devoid as they are of proper formation.","4087":"Actually, there's more than enough blame to go around -- Osama bin Laden has now gotten away during two presidencies. How the current president used semantic tricks to conflate Saddam with bin Laden, allowing him to escape yet again, is something we'd rather not think about just now. No doubt the Clinton revival will be as short-lived as Reagan's. But for the moment it takes us back to that halcyon time when we could despise a president for falsifying the meaning of a word as free of terror as 'is.'","4089":"It's official. The Roundabout Theater Company production of the Tony Award-winning musical revival 'Assassins' will close on July 18 after 26 previews and 93 performances at Studio 54. But Mario Cantone of its cast knows where his next job is coming from: himself. As writer and star, he'll be at the Cort Theater in a one-man variety show, 'Laugh Whore,' opening on Oct. 17 and dealing with topics like the news and people like Osama bin Laden, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli and Jim Morrison.","409":"Many Arabs had been hoping that some last-minute disclosure would link the attacks to anarchist groups in the United States. But with increasing signs that indicated Middle East ties, specifically to the violent Muslim fundamentalist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, there was an expectation that the United States would seek revenge.","4090":"Osama bin Laden and his chief lieutenants, operating from suspected hideouts along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, are directing a Qaeda effort to launch an attack in the United States this year, senior Bush administration officials said. A1","4091":"General Musharraf is not an apocalyptic zealot like Osama bin Laden, an erratic recluse like North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, or a public vilifier of America, like Iran's ruling clerics. But neither is he a convinced or convincing ally in the struggle against radical Islamic terrorism, nuclear weapons proliferation and destructive dictatorship.","4092":"Osama bin Laden and his chief lieutenants, operating from hideouts suspected to be along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, are directing a Qaeda effort to launch an attack in the United States sometime this year, senior Bush administration officials said on Thursday.","4093":"In its pages, prescient analyses of recent developments in the Persian Gulf and Middle East (informed by the author's experience in the mid-1990's as head of a C.I.A. unit assigned to tracking Osama bin Laden) jostle for space with incendiary calls for a Shermanesque exercise of American military power in a potential war with the Muslim world; maverick assessments of Islamic attitudes toward the United States, with shrill exhortations for America to adopt a neo-isolationist stance based on narrowly defined self-interest.","4094":"In short order, that same group of defectors took their stories to American intelligence agents and journalists. The defectors spoke of a nation pocketed with mobile weapons laboratories, a new secret weapons site beneath a Baghdad hospital, a meeting between a member of Mr. Hussein's government and Osama bin Laden -- accounts that ultimately became potent elements in Mr. Bush's case for war.","4095":"In a television interview last month, Vice President Dick Cheney insisted that 'there's clearly been a relationship' between Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and that 'the evidence is overwhelming.'","4096":"The report reaffirmed a finding by another panel investigating intelligence failures before the 9/11 attacks in saying that there was no 'established formal relationship' between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. It also said there was no evidence that Iraq had been complicit in any attack by Osama bin Laden, or that Saddam Hussein had ever tried to use Al Qaeda for an attack. Although the report said the C.I.A.'s conclusions had been 'widely disseminated' in the government, Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have repeatedly talked of an Iraq-Qaeda link.","4098":"He added: 'We all live, you know, on a kind of fictional planet -- the place we have with us ever since we started listening to stories. We spend a lot of time in these imaginary worlds, and we get to know them better than the real locations we pass on the street every day. I think they play a more important part in our shaping of the world than we realize. Hitler, for example -- we know he read a lot of Bulwer-Lytton. Osama bin Laden used to read quite a lot of Western science fiction. That's why comics feel important to me. They're immense fun as a game, but there's also something more serious going on.'","4099":"In dozens of interviews this weekend, people from San Francisco to Miami spoke of broad concerns, too, about the intelligence failings pointedly described in the committee's 511-page report. What, some asked, did it signify about the government's larger understanding of world events? What did it mean for the reliability of intelligence on Osama bin Laden's whereabouts or on the nature or seriousness of terror threats?","41":"Mr. Clinton asked the general to take action against terrorist groups operating in Pakistan and to help pressure the Taliban government in Afghanistan to bring to justice, Osama bin Laden, the terrorist whom the United States believes is responsible for the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa.","4101":"The report has given Mr. Bush's political opponents new ammunition to suggest that the war was fought on a false or at least flawed pretext, that it has drawn resources away from efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden and battle Al Qaeda, and that it has damaged the standing of the United States in the world.","4102":"He remains a singular target: American forces are stepping up airstrikes on buildings they believe to be his safe houses in Falluja and have raised the bounty on him to $25 million, the figure offered for Osama bin Laden.","4103":"Al Jazeera won over millions of Arab viewers before and during the American-led war on Afghanistan in 2001 after broadcasting exclusive images of Osama bin Laden after the attacks on the United States. The station has irritated authoritarian Arab governments as much as it has Washington.","4104":"A Saudi suspected of being a member of Al Qaeda, who had appeared on a videotape with Osama bin Laden, was flown back to the kingdom from Iran after he surrendered under a Saudi amnesty, state television said.

PAGE A8","4108":"Think about that. Do today's groupthinkers believe that Osama bin Laden would sit down with Saddam in front of the world's cameras to sign a mutual assistance pact, establishing a formal relationship? Terrorists and rogue states don't work that way. Mass killers collaborate informally, without a photo op, even secretly.","411":"Such a campaign could involve American forces in protracted fighting against a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and even Pakistan, which occupies a vital strategic position south of Afghanistan, where the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden is believed to be based.","4110":"Bob Herbert is not alone in arguing that the war in Iraq was a catastrophic and counterproductive detour from the campaign against the terrorist threat. But his solution to use 'overwhelming force' along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan where Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding may be just as futile.","4111":"But the overriding explanation is that crime has simply fallen under the emotional shadow of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Willie Horton, the rapist made notorious by Mr. Bush's father in the 1988 campaign, has been replaced by Osama bin Laden as the poster boy for what ails America.","4112":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Courtailler was arrested days after the Sept. 11 attacks in connection with the Paris plot. Dozens of fake passports were found in his Dutch apartment, together with videos of Chechnya, the attack on the American Embassy in Kenya and Osama bin Laden, and instructions on how to make a bomb.","4113":"Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the commission's report would offer extensive new evidence to show that Iran had provided logistical support over the years to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network.","4114":"O.K., end of conceit. President Bush isn't actually an Al Qaeda mole, with Dick Cheney his controller. Mr. Bush's 'war on terror' has, however, played with eerie perfection into Osama bin Laden's hands -- while Mr. Bush's supporters, impressed by his tough talk, see him as America's champion against the evildoers.","4115":"In the past five months, the Pakistani Army, at the behest of the United States, has pushed into the normally autonomous tribal areas, in an attempt to capture or kill an estimated 500 foreign fighters -- many of them hardened Uzbek and Central Asian militants -- and supporting tribesmen, and to search for Osama bin Laden and his Egyptian deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who are often rumored to be sheltering in the area.","4116":"Australia is not sending armed personnel, Australian officials said, even though it will have the second largest athletic contingent at the Games, sent troops to Iraq, and has been singled out for attack by Osama bin Laden. It has contracted with private Greek companies for extra security, they said.","4118":"One administration official with access to the report pointed out that it declassifies, for the first time, a Dec. 4, 1998, C.I.A. briefing prepared for President Clinton. The secret report detailed efforts by Osama bin Laden to hijack an American airliner, part of an effort to force the release of those who bombed the World Trade Center five years earlier.","4119":"On Thursday, the panel of five Democrats and five Republicans is scheduled to release a book-length final report that will show how virtually every element of national security failed on Sept. 11 and why Osama bin Laden was able to dispatch 19 Arab terrorists across American borders undetected, murder 3,000 people in a matter of hours and change the course of the nation's history.","412":"Many Arabs had been hoping that some last-minute disclosure would link the attacks to anarchist groups in the United States. But with increasing signs that indicated Middle East ties, specifically to the violent Muslim fundamentalist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, there was an expectation that the United States would seek revenge.","4120":"The head was found during a raid on Tuesday of the suspected hide-out of Saleh al-Awfi, the reputed leader of Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, the main franchise in the kingdom of Osama bin Laden's group. The raid led to a gun battle with militants inside, killing two men, including the editor of the group's Web magazine, Sawt al-Jihad, or Voice of the Holy War, who was on the list of the kingdom's 26 most wanted militants, security officials said.","4121":"The report is expected to criticize the Bush administration's handling of intelligence about terrorism, but it will also contain significant criticisms of the Clinton administration and the National Security Council that Mr. Berger ran, in the pursuit of Osama bin Laden.","4123":"The interrogations of the Qaeda members have been a major factor in raising American concerns about a possible attack to a level not seen since Sept. 11, the intelligence officials said. They said that the captured members of Al Qaeda had provided clues that traced planning for a major attack back to the group's central leadership, including Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be in the Afghan-Pakistan border region.","4124":"The report goes into detail about how the C.I.A. developed a plan to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in 1997 and 1998, when intelligence was deemed especially good about his residence at Tarnak Farms on the outskirts of Kandahar, Afghanistan.","4125":"In a series of findings that were searing in tone, sweeping in judgment and backed by voluminous reporting, the report said senior officials were repeatedly warned about Osama bin Laden's intentions, but failed to respond with an aggressive sense of national purpose.","4126":"'It is hard to overstate the importance of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamist extremism,' the report said. 'Within Pakistan's borders are 150 million Muslims, scores of Al Qaeda terrorists, many Taliban fighters, and perhaps Osama bin Laden. Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons and has come frighteningly close to war with nuclear-armed India over the disputed territory of Kashmir.'","4127":"I am struck by how little both sides mention the failure to capture Osama bin Laden or the developing failure to turn Afghanistan into a viable state. We have spent more than 1,000 American lives and billions of dollars, and still the chief perpetrators remain at large.","4128":"At the time, it was understood that all of the hijackers had entered the country legally and done nothing to draw attention to themselves; Osama bin Laden had underwritten the plot with his personal fortune but had left the details to others; American intelligence agencies had no warning that Al Qaeda was considering suicide missions using planes; President Bush had received a special intelligence briefing weeks before Sept. 11 that focused on past, not current, terrorist threats from Al Qaeda.","413":"These terrorists must be rooted out and destroyed. But it must be done in a way that doesn't make us Osama bin Laden's chief recruiter. Because these Muslim terrorists did not just want to kill Americans. That is not the totality of their mission. These people think strategically. They also want to trigger the sort of massive U.S. retaliation that makes no distinction between them and other Muslims. That would be their ultimate victory -- because they do see the world as a clash of civilizations, and they want every Muslim to see it that way as well and to join their jihad.","4130":"Next, Bamford describes the rise of Osama bin Laden and how the United States kept missing him. Only in Part 3 does the book get into the Pentagon's 'pretext for war' and 'the abuse of America's intelligence agencies.' But here it turns numbingly unoriginal and conceptually confused.","4131":"In May 1998, George J. Tenet, then director of central intelligence, scrapped a heavily rehearsed raid to kidnap Osama bin Laden from his compound in Kandahar, Afghanistan, according to the report by the Sept. 11 commission.","4132":"Mr. Imam has called on all Islamic countries to boycott the Games, because of the fighting in the West Bank and Gaza, Afghanistan and Iraq.

And there was Max Cleland, the triple amputee and former Democratic senator from Georgia whose defeat in 2002 -- by an opponent who ran commercials linking him to Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden -- has become a rallying point for Democrats determined not to let Republicans who avoided combat bludgeon them with patriotic symbols.","4135":"We have to be crystal clear about the threat we face from terrorism. It is deadly. It is real. It is imminent. But in order to protect our people, shouldn't we focus on the real source of this threat: the group that attacked us and is trying to attack us again: Al Qaeda, headed by Osama bin Laden? Wouldn't we be safer with a president who didn't insist on confusing Al Qaeda with Iraq? Doesn't that divert too much of our attention away from the principal danger?","4136":"Mr. Caraballo's brother Richard said the film was based on a book, 'The Hunt for Bin Laden,' by Robin Moore. Mr. Idema has said he co-wrote the book, the story of a Special Forces team assigned to capture Osama bin Laden.","4137":"Voters need to know whether Mr. Kerry agrees. Or would he have held back on invading Iraq and chosen instead to pursue the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the destruction of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and to focus diplomatic resources on places like North Korea and Iran? Mr. Kerry's advisers don't want more accusations of flip-flopping, and they've told him to avoid hypotheticals. But while voters are certainly prepared to accept a candidate with a complex worldview, they also value the courage that comes with occasionally taking a leap and giving an answer that's straight and simple.","4139":"This appears to be the first high-level arrest resulting from military operations that Pakistan began in the North-West Frontier Province five months ago. An intelligence official said earlier this week that the operation had forced some foreign militants to flee the tribal areas and seek shelter in Pakistani cities, but said no new evidence about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden had been discovered.","414":"If they ruled a state they would have something to lose: their state would be militarily punished and they would be evicted from power. That is what we call war. Terrorists cannot defeat a state in war. They can only weaken it from within by attacking its most vulnerable point: ordinary people. All modern terrorist movements -- the I.R.A., the Tamil Tigers, the Muslim militants inspired by Osama bin Laden -- use this tactic.","4140":"Along the border with Pakistan, an array of spy satellites and reconnaissance aircraft help in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and other militants who slip back and forth across the mountainous border, and use their sanctuaries to launch nightly rocket and mortar attacks against American military outposts.","4141":"This is the strange terrain of 'Public Enemies.' In 1933 and 1934, millions of Americans, unmoored by the Depression, were drifting up and down the roads, whole families sleeping in their cars, living in what were known, in a grimly chipper euphemism, as 'tourist camps,' essentially middle-class shantytowns on wheels. The stage was set for the emergence of a new kind of criminal, highly mobile, armed with submachine guns, able to blend into the dust bowl diaspora as Osama bin Laden blends among the Pashtun. The names of these bogeymen still resonate: Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, Ma Barker, Bonnie and Clyde, Dillinger himself. Another in this group, an Oklahoma bank robber named Charles (Pretty Boy) Floyd, would become a true folk hero of the plains, the subject of a classic Woody Guthrie song of protest against capital: 'Yes, as through this world I've wandered, / I've seen lots of funny men, / Some will rob you with a six-gun, / And some with a fountain pen.'","4142":"The information uncovered in recent days overlapped with broader concerns that Al Qaeda might plot an attack on or before the Nov. 2 presidential election in an effort to repeat the disruption caused by the Madrid bombings in March. Officials said they believed that senior Qaeda leaders along the Afghan-Pakistani border, including Osama bin Laden, were personally involved in such plots.","4143":"Asked about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mr. Khan has told interrogators that even the top Qaeda commanders do not know, the Pakistani intelligence official said.","4144":"In addition, car bombs are cheap and relatively easy to build using stolen or legally purchased chemicals and using rudimentary designs that were taught at several of Osama bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan-- like the remote-control bombs used in March in the commuter train attacks in Madrid.","4145":"The command wants to hand off to conventional troops such tasks as training foreign troops in conventional missions, dealing with chemical and biological weapon threats, and even many house-to-house raids of the sort carried out daily in Iraq and Afghanistan, leaving commandos to pursue only the most important insurgents. Senior Special Operations commanders say they are well aware that terrorists like Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi remain at large, and that the terrorists' networks cross national and regional boundaries. 'Since 9/11, we can no longer deal with this threat in pieces,' said a senior Defense Department official. 'You've got to have a global perspective, and that's what Socom is responsible for.'","4146":"The information uncovered in recent days overlapped with broader concerns that Al Qaeda might plot an attack on or before the Nov. 2 presidential election in an effort to repeat the disruption caused by the Madrid bombings in March. Officials said they believed that senior Qaeda leaders along the Afghan-Pakistani border, including Osama bin Laden, were personally involved in such plots.","4147":"Since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden has implored terrorists on several occasions to strike targets that will harm the economy in the United States and elsewhere. But a man claiming to be Mr. bin Laden went even further in a tape-recorded statement released April 29, saying that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks devastated the American economy and the United States government's budget. For the first time, it appeared, Mr. bin Laden estimated the economic impact by citing specific statistics.","4148":"Five Moroccans held at the American prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, for more than two years have been handed to Moroccan authorities for investigation, the MAP state news agency said. The men, captured in Afghanistan and Pakistan on suspicion of serving as fighters for the Taliban, arrived in Morocco on Sunday. One, Abdallah Tabarak, has been described as a former bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.","4149":"The exposure of the two men, one an experienced foreign operative and the other a young Pakistani who is thought to have passed messages for Al Qaeda, illustrates how senior members of the terrorist network, possibly even Osama bin Laden, continue to successfully hide in Pakistan. Both men appear to have been part of what senior Pakistani officials describe as an elaborate and well-equipped underground network the group has established in this country, a critical American ally in fighting terrorism.","4150":"ON THE TRAIL OF TERROR -- The recent arrests of two men linked to Al Qaeda illustrate how senior members of the network, possibly even Osama bin Laden, continue to hide successfully in Pakistan. PAGE A10","4151":"On weekends, he and his friends shoot at pictures of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. 'It's a way of handling hostility, I guess,' Mr. Jenkinson said, with a shrug.","4152":"Mr. Khalil has been involved in recruiting and training militants since the 1980's. In 1998, American planes bombed his training camp in Afghanistan when they were targeting Osama bin Laden after the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombing killed a number of Pakistanis, and Mr. Khalil at the time vowed to take revenge against America for the attack.","4153":"'So much of the counterterrorism thing is political,' Mr. Kupetz said. 'I wouldn't be surprised if they caught Osama bin Laden two days before the election. Absolutely I think Bush is using the war on terrorism to his advantage.'","4154":"For Mr. Soyinka, these issues are indeed close to home: not only have 12 states in northern Nigeria adopted Sharia, or traditional Islamic law, but Osama bin Laden has called Nigeria a nation in need of 'liberation.'","4155":"'Al Qaeda will wait years to act and decades to succeed,' Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the federal prosecutor who has been investigating Osama bin Laden for about a decade, told the 9/11 commission this summer.","4156":"The author of 'Imperial Hubris,' who wrote the book anonymously, is a longtime counterterrorism official at the C.I.A. who previously ran the agency's unit that concentrated on Osama bin Laden. In his book and in subsequent interviews, the author has said he believes that the war in Iraq has been a major distraction from the effort to fight Al Qaeda and that the war has also inflamed Islamic resentment against the United States while aiding Al Qaeda's recruitment among Muslims.","4157":"Speaking of weapons of mass destruction, it's sad that not quite three years after the terrorist attacks, 'Tiger Cruise' feels polarizing rather than patriotic. When Chuck says of the people who attacked the United States, 'I think we should go after them with everything we've got,' it takes a minute to remember that he means Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, not Saddam Hussein and Iraq. When, at the end, the children unfurl a giant American flag on deck, it should be a moment of pride. But it's hard not to think of another banner on an aircraft carrier, the one that said 'mission accomplished,' more than a year ago.","4158":"The affidavit of the prisoner, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a 34-year-old Yemeni, said he did not know how long he had been kept in isolation at Guant\u00e1namo, but suggested it was at least eight months. The prisoner, who has admitted to having been a driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, also said he was regularly beaten by American guards in Afghanistan after his capture there at the end of 2001.","4159":"American intelligence officials now believe that Issa al-Hindi, the Al Qaeda operative now in British custody, was dispatched to the United States in early 2001 by Khalid Sheik Mohammed at the direction of Osama bin Laden to case potential targets in New York City. A1","416":"A few lawmakers were demanding a full declaration of war against international terrorism. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said Congress might want to consider a declaration of war against Afghanistan for having harbored Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant whose associates, authorities believe, commandeered the jets that struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","4160":"I didn't turn into Vladek, with his innate sense of practicality in the midst of disaster -- though his admonition to 'always keep your bags packed' came to mind. It was my wife who turned into a more beautiful version of Vladek. I was a broken husk of a space cadet. Later, in trying to understand what was happening to my relationship to Fran\u00e7oise that day, I ended up drawing this Mad Comics interaction with her where I got to be Jiggs and she was Maggie. [They are characters in 'Bringing Up Father,' a George McManus comic strip that first appeared in 1913 about a newly rich Irishman and his nagging wife.] And from Maggie, she got transformed into Osama bin Laden.","4161":"American intelligence officials now believe that Issa al-Hindi, the alleged Qaeda operative now in British custody, was dispatched to the United States in early 2001 by the mastermind of the Sept. 11 plot at the direction of Osama bin Laden to case potential targets in New York City, senior government officials said Friday.","4162":"Except for the twisted conclusion that he draws from his dissent, Jay is not, as I say, a stranger in contemporary America. Late in the novel he explains that 'we've reached a point beyond the normal -- we've reached a point of intolerability.' The opinion that these are not normal times, that the Bush years are apocalyptic years, is quite common. 'We are no longer in the ordinary times we were in when the conservatives took out after Bill Clinton,' Janet Malcolm recently explained in a letter to this newspaper. 'We are in a time now that is as fearful as the period after Munich.' Life in South Egremont, Mass., may be excruciating, but Malcolm's knowledge of the period after Munich has plainly grown dim. And who, in her ominous analogy, is Hitler? If it is Osama bin Laden, then she might have a little sympathy for the seriousness of this administration about American security, whatever her views about some of its policies. If it is George W. Bush. . . . Well, she continues: 'Those of us who are demonizing George W. Bush are doing so not because of his morals but because we are scared of what another four years of his administration will do to this country and to the world.' So whether or not Bush is Hitler, he is a devil. This is what now passes for smart.","4163":"In the 1990's, Sudan was considered by Washington to be a haven for terrorists, including Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden operated out of Sudan in that period. Recently, Sudan has been more cooperative on terrorism.","4164":"7 1 INSIDE THE KINGDOM, by Carmen bin Ladin. (Warner, $23.95.) A sister-in-law of Osama bin Laden describes her life in Saudi Arabia, her separation from her husband and her battle for custody of her children.","4165":"In Durban, the Islamic Propagation Center International has long been financed by the bin Laden family in Saudi Arabia, and its founder, Ahmed Deedat, who is now dead, was a vocal anti-Semite and ardent backer of Osama bin Laden.","4166":"In San Francisco, some critics have also argued that the proposals raise security concerns. Louise Renne, a former city attorney in San Francisco and a longtime critic of the concept, recently raised the question of whether terrorists would soon be allowed access to the polls. \"If noncitizens can vote,' she asked reporters, 'can Osama bin Laden vote in a school election?\"","4167":"The new picture emerged from interviews with two officials who have been briefed on some of the details of the intelligence and analytical conclusions drawn from the information on computers seized after Mr. Khan's arrest. But they did not identify the more senior Qaeda leaders, and they said it was not yet clear to what extent Osama bin Laden still exercised control over the organization, either directly or through his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.","4168":"Last month, the same group promised to begin attacks across Europe after the expiration of a truce proposed by Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden. In a taped message believed to have been recorded by Mr. bin Laden, the group gave European countries three months to pull their troops out of Muslim countries like Afghanistan and Iraq or face attacks like the train bombings in March in Madrid, which killed 191 people.","4169":"There is always going to be some threatening chatter among our enemies. There are more than 4,000 Web sites maintained by terrorist groups, and specific targets, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or financial institutions in the United States and Britain, are openly discussed. Since Osama bin Laden's expressed goal is to weaken the West financially, every family that avoids a ballpark or decides not to take a vacation is advancing the aims of terrorists. It may be that people like Tom Ridge and John Ashcroft can take their children to the Statue of Liberty while maintaining the recommended 'heightened awareness,' but it sounds like a trip to hell to me.","417":"Intelligence officials believe the attacks were organized by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been implicated in a series of bloody assaults against Americans.","4170":"That Mr. Motassadeq had links to terrorists is not in dispute. He was a friend of two of the hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, wiring money to Mr. Shehhi. He also admitted attending a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan sponsored by Osama bin Laden. But he denied knowing about the impending attacks and said he had helped the hijackers unwittingly.","4171":"One of those Democrats was Senator Max Cleland of Georgia. Republicans ran a television commercial showing pictures of Mr. Cleland, Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, and said Mr. Cleland 'voted against the president's vital homeland security efforts 11 times.' Mr. Cleland lost his seat. 'They've got the trump card,' a top Senate Democratic aide said of the Republicans. 'And the reality is, that despite all the intelligence problems with this White House, we do need a C.I.A. director.'","4172":"Mr. Motassadeq's outsider status was affirmed by another Qaeda leader, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who told interrogators that he never discussed the plot with him, although he helped Mr. Motassadeq arrange a trip to Afghanistan, where he spent time in a training camp sponsored by Osama bin Laden.","4173":"At the direction of Osama bin Laden in early 2001, Mr. Hindi was dispatched to the United States 'to case potential economic and 'Jewish' targets in New York City.'","4174":"'Would you want the government to have open discussions about whether we could legitimately assassinate Osama bin Laden, and what rules you'd have to follow?' asked Mr. Yoo, who teaches law at the University of California at Berkeley. 'Suppose it was disclosed that the government concluded that you couldn't attack Osama in a civilian's house. You would be telling the other side what to avoid.'","4175":"And in Washington, there is so much talk of the 'pre-election threat' that a senior White House official was insisting to reporters on Thursday that Election Day will go forward no matter what Osama bin Laden may be contemplating to influence the outcome.","4176":"6 7 2 INSIDE THE KINGDOM, by Carmen bin Ladin. (Warner, $23.95.) A sister-in-law of Osama bin Laden describes her life in Saudi Arabia, her separation from her husband and her battle for custody of her children.","4177":"A senior officer for the Central Intelligence Agency who led the unit that tracked Osama bin Laden has written a blistering letter to the Sept. 11 commission, attacking both the C.I.A. and the commission itself over what he sees as a failure to punish 'bureaucratic cowards' in the intelligence agencies.","4178":"Mr. Bush needs to live up to his campaign promise and push to keep the ban on assault weapons. Otherwise, we'll bring more of the Iraq-like carnage to our own shores, and his refusal to confront our gun problem will kill more Americans over time than Osama bin Laden ever could.","4179":"Mr. Barot is also believed to have conducted surveillance activities in the United States in 2000 and early 2001 under the alias Issa al-Britani, or Issa the Briton, according to the report of the Sept. 11 commission. That surveillance, of targets other than the World Trade Center, was ordered by Osama bin Laden and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the chief planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to the commission report.","418":"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell yesterday identified Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has taken refuge in Afghanistan, as the prime suspect in engineering the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. That has put the focus of potential retaliation in central Asia, though that could change if the United States concluded that an Arab country had provided support.","4181":"An article on Aug. 9 about a movement by immigrants across the United States to win the right to vote in municipal elections referred incorrectly to a comment from Louise Renne, a former city attorney in San Francisco and longtime critic of the concept, who asked, 'If noncitizens can vote, can Osama bin Laden vote in a school election?' Ms. Renne asked the rhetorical question in an interview with a reporter from The San Francisco Chronicle. She was not talking to 'reporters.'","4182":"'Osama: The Making of a Terrorist' by a former Washington Post correspondent, Jonathan Randal, is less a biography of Al Qaeda's mastermind Osama bin Laden than a history of the contemporary jihadi movement, from its emergence in the mountains of Afghanistan during the 1980's war against the Soviet Union, through the planning of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, to its current metastasis in the wake of the Iraq war.","4183":"'Osama: The Making of a Terrorist' by a former Washington Post correspondent, Jonathan Randal, is less a biography of Al Qaeda's mastermind Osama bin Laden than a history of the contemporary jihadi movement, from its emergence in the mountains of Afghanistan during the 1980's war against the Soviet Union, through the planning of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, to its current metastasis in the wake of the Iraq war.","4185":"His client is charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism and war crimes. Mr. Bahlul is accused of having sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden, traveled with him as a bodyguard and made a videotape that was used as a recruiting tool for Mr. bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","4186":"In a second staff study released Saturday evening on the issue of terrorist travels, the commission's investigators offered new details about their inquiry into a series of charter flights arranged by the Saudi government after Sept. 11 to ferry its citizens out of the country, including members of the extended clan of Osama bin Laden.","4187":"10 6 3 INSIDE THE KINGDOM, by Carmen bin Ladin. (Warner, $23.95.) A sister-in-law of Osama bin Laden describes her life in Saudi Arabia, her separation from her husband and her battle for custody of her children.","4188":"In short, we appear to have an airport security problem that has nothing directly to do with Osama bin Laden. As of late yesterday afternoon, I had received more than 100 credible reports from readers saying that things were stolen from their checked bags, evidently by Transportation Security Administration screeners who open millions of checked bags a day for inspection, or by airline baggage handlers who move the luggage on and off planes.","4189":"He claims to have broken up a terrorist plot that would have left two Afghan ministers and hundreds of American soldiers dead -- and to have been hot on the trail of Osama bin Laden. Much of the trial hinges on whether American and Afghan officials approved his detentions and interrogations in a Kabul house, and on whether he stopped multiple terrorist plots, or invented them.","419":"'It's not possible to seize him and bring him to trial,' Mr. Bayh said, referring to Osama bin Laden if he turns out to be culpable. 'You can argue that a more targeted approach may be in order.'","4190":"The Taliban, a hard-line Islamic religious movement made up of Afghans, was financed and equipped by Pakistani military intelligence when it won control of most of Afghanistan in the mid-1990's, according to Pakistani and American military analysts. Their leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, later gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and his cadre of Al Qaeda, who were mostly Arabs and other foreigners.","4191":"Mr. Hamdam, who has admitted being a driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, could be sentenced to life in prison. PAGE A14","4192":"Mr. Hamdan, 34, has admitted that he was a driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, but has denied the military's charges that he was involved in any way with Al Qaeda or terrorism. The trial of Mr. Hamdan is one of four that will formally begin this week with preliminary hearings on motions by lawyers for the defendants, all of whom are charged with some version of conspiracy to commit terrorism.","4193":"The first reports sounded like an over-the-top satire of the Bush Pentagon: the deputy secretary of defense for intelligence -- the ranking general charged with the hunt for Osama bin Laden -- was parading in uniform to Christian pulpits, preaching that God had put George Bush in the White House and that Islamic terrorists will only be defeated 'if we come at them in the name of Jesus.' But now a Pentagon inquiry has concluded that Lt. Gen. William Boykin did indeed preach his grossly offensive gospel at 23 churches, pronouncing Satan the mastermind of the terrorists because 'he wants to destroy us as a Christian army.'","4194":"The defendant, Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al-Bahlul, who has been charged with being a top aide to Osama bin Laden, engaged, through translators, in a polite but aggressive 30-minute colloquy with the presiding officer in which he attacked the fairness of the process and demanded to serve as his own lawyer.","4195":"The issue arose at the hearing for Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi of Sudan, who is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and terrorism. Military prosecutors assert that Mr. Qosi, 44, was an associate of Osama bin Laden for more than 14 years and served as a paymaster for Al Qaeda for much of that time.","4196":"The commission's contention that 'the terrorists exploited deep institutional failings within our government' is overblown. By the mid-1990's the government knew that Osama bin Laden was a dangerous enemy of the United States. President Clinton and his national security adviser, Samuel Berger, were so concerned that Clinton, though 'warned in the strongest terms' by the Secret Service and the C.I.A. that 'visiting Pakistan would risk the president's life,' did visit that country (flying in on an unmarked plane, using decoys and remaining only six hours) and tried unsuccessfully to enlist its cooperation against bin Laden. Clinton authorized the assassination of bin Laden, and a variety of means were considered for achieving this goal, but none seemed feasible. Invading Afghanistan to pre-empt future attacks by Al Qaeda was considered but rejected for diplomatic reasons, which President Bush accepted when he took office and which look even more compelling after the trouble we've gotten into with our pre-emptive invasion of Iraq. The complaint that Clinton was merely 'swatting at flies,' and the claim that Bush from the start was determined to destroy Al Qaeda root and branch, are belied by the commission's report. The Clinton administration envisaged a campaign of attrition that would last three to five years, the Bush administration a similar campaign that would last three years. With an invasion of Afghanistan impracticable, nothing better was on offer. Almost four years after Bush took office and almost three years after we wrested control of Afghanistan from the Taliban, Al Qaeda still has not been destroyed.","4198":"More recently, Mr. Mahfouz, who is in his mid-50's and lives in his native country, has come under scrutiny because of a charity he helped start, called the Muwafaq Foundation. In the weeks after the 9/11 attack, the Treasury Department characterized Muwafaq as 'an Al Qaeda front' that had transferred millions of dollars to Osama bin Laden.","42":"'Maybe he's not coming,' said Usman Ghani, one of the people watching at the store. 'Maybe he's afraid Osama bin Laden is waiting on the runway.'","420":"NEW DELHI, Sept. 13\u2014 The terrorist attacks on the United States appear increasingly likely to touch off a moment of reckoning for Pakistan, which has long supported the fundamentalist Taliban militia in Afghanistan, protector of the United States' prime terrorist suspect, Osama bin Laden.","4200":"He tells of his affinity with Osama bin Laden, whom he recalls for his role in the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, but not for ordering the Sept. 11 attacks. 'General bin Laden,' he says, 'went through hundreds, even thousands of battles. He was an essential element in the collapse of the Soviet Union.' He is bitter that Mr. bin Laden's 'reward from America' is a $25 million bounty.","4201":"The videotapes showing the killing of the guard commander, the humiliation of the governor, and the beheading of the Egyptian all display the black-and-yellow flag of the Zarqawi group as a backdrop, and the passages of the Koran chanted as an accompaniment to the killings are drawn from passages of the Muslim holy book that have accompanied some of the videotaped pronouncements by Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden. Iraqis who have watched the Falluja tapes say the Egyptian's executioner speaks in a cultured Arabic that is foreign, possibly Jordanian or Palestinian.","4202":"10 10 4 INSIDE THE KINGDOm, by Carmen bin Ladin. (Warner, $23.95.) A sister-in-law of Osama bin Laden describes her life.","4203":"Not all the Iraq criticism, of course, was coming from Americans. Among the nightly street performances along the city's Royal Mile were a pair of anonymous British comedians -- decked out in heavy latex masks -- who staged a popular comedic fistfight between Osama bin Laden and President Bush. (Neither character emerged a winner.)","4204":"His remarks serve as ready-made ammunition for Osama bin Laden and company to fight the war of public opinion in the Muslim world with respect to American actions in the Mideast and elsewhere.","4205":"Analysts said Mr. Bush's comment reflected both foreign policy and political realities, and appeared intended in part to emphasize that even a striking breakthrough, like the capture of Osama bin Laden, would not by itself assure the nation's security.","4206":"'Osama bin Laden is on the run,' J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, said in a speech that was similar to Mr. Bush's frequent statements on Al Qaeda.","4207":"The Republicans had good reason to recall that sense of shared purpose -- and Mr. Bush's role in creating it before he splintered that consensus with his invasion of Iraq -- on the very day that NBC News broadcast an interview with Mr. Bush in which he suggested the war on terror might not be winnable in the conventional sense. None of the prime-time speakers mentioned the name of the man who remains a symbol of that challenge: Osama bin Laden.","4208":"Offering examples addressing both Iraq and Afghanistan, he said he would have sent American troops into the mountains of Tora Bora to prevent the escape of Osama bin Laden, rather than rely on Afghans \"who a week earlier were fighting on the other side.\"","4209":"The attacks did not so much bring out new qualities in Mr. Bush as bring to the fore the most compelling, and sometimes polarizing, aspects of his personality. He was the gunslinging cowboy, suggesting that he wanted Osama bin Laden \"dead or alive.\" He was, improbably, given his self-described struggle for words, an occasionally stirring orator to the nation and the world. He was consoler in chief, exhibiting the natural politician's ability to connect; Arlene Howard, the mother of George Howard, a Port Authority police officer killed at the World Trade Center, gave Mr. Bush her son's badge, a memento he kept to remember the heroism and heartbreak of that day.","421":"Afghanistan is the principal base camp and sanctuary for Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the terrorist attacks. But any American effort to deal with the bin Laden organization will inevitably touch on the concerns of other nations that share this troubled neighborhood, including Pakistan, India, Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Washington's initiatives will be more effective if they take account of the interests, and where possible enlist the support, of these regional powers. Ill-conceived or -executed policies can easily backfire. Much of Afghanistan's current lawlessness is due to the past mistakes of Russia, Pakistan and the United States.","4210":"The Republican conventioneers spent the entire week reminding America that we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. But interestingly, there was hardly a mention by name of those who were actually responsible for the attacks -- Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","4211":"For all that, there was one notable omission from Mr. Bush's speech. The president made no mention of the foreign figure who arguably most influenced his first term in the White House: Osama bin Laden, the yet-to-be-captured leader of Al Qaeda.","4212":"The promised economic boom hasn't materialized, Iraq is a bloody quagmire, and Osama bin Laden has gone from \"dead or alive\" to he-who-must-not-be-named.","4213":"If Senator Kerry can't handle Dick Cheney, the Swift Boat veterans and the Republican National Convention, how is he going to handle Osama bin Laden, the buildup of weapons of mass destruction by North Korea and the real terrorists who threaten our country?","4214":"He did it. George W. Bush gave an acceptance speech that did not mention Osama bin Laden. This was one of a number of critical names, facts and realities that went unmentioned.","4215":"Scott LoBaido, a painter from Staten Island, was also among the few artists happy to see the Republicans in town. He sold one of his unabashedly pro-Bush works -- a painting called \"Have Faith,\" which shows the president astride a horse, carrying the flag in one hand and the severed head of Osama bin Laden in the other -- for $2,800 at the Tribute Gallery on lower Broadway.","4216":"Cantor Fitzgerald, the brokerage firm that lost 658 employees in the Sept. 11 attack, has sued Saudi Arabia, charging that the kingdom \"provided funding and material support and substantial assistance\" to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","4217":"For the better part of two summers, a Wildwood Boardwalk concessionaire, Michael Rutkowski, has run a paintball game that took aim at Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Called, ungrammatically, Wack the Iraq, it had as a come-on from the boardwalk a life-size statue in camouflage that looked vaguely like Mr. Hussein.","4218":"WeeksThis Last OnWeek Week List Fiction 1 1 75 THE DA VINCI CODE, by Dan Brown.

As Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit wrote in a recent book, \"Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of Its Enemies,\" the target here is \"the idea of America itself, as a rootless, cosmopolitan, superficial, trivial, materialistic, racially mixed, fashion-addicted civilization.\"","422":"With his gentle eyes, skeletal frame, long black beard and habitual Kalashnikov, Osama bin Laden has become the world's most reviled symbol of terror.","4220":"TERRORISTS are striving to acquire and then use nuclear weapons against the United States. Success, as defined by Osama bin Laden, would be four million dead Americans. Mounting evidence makes this much abundantly clear. Documents discovered in Afghanistan seem to reveal Al Qaeda's detailed knowledge of nuclear weaponry, while intelligence confirms the terrorists' attempts to acquire nuclear material on the black market.","4221":"Elsewhere, a week of silence over the fate of two French hostages was broken Monday when Al Jazeera, the Arab news network, reported that an Islamic militant group holding the men had demanded a ransom of $5 million; it also demanded that France declare a truce with Osama bin Laden and that France and French companies quit doing business in Iraq.","4222":"Prosecutors in the trial of Lynne F. Stewart, a lawyer accused of aiding terrorism, showed jurors a videotape yesterday of Osama bin Laden summoning Muslims to fight to free an Islamic cleric held in an American prison.","4223":"\"Why don't you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or to the White House and engage in talks, ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace?\" he said, according to The Guardian. \"You find it possible to set some limitations in your dealings with these bastards, so why should we talk to people who are child-killers?\"","4225":"Writing in the pan-Arab newspaper Al Sharq al Awsat, Mr. Rashed said it was \"shameful and degrading\" that not only were the Beslan hijackers Muslims, but so were the killers of Nepalese workers in Iraq; the attackers of residential towers in Riyadh and Khobar, Saudi Arabia; the women believed to have blown up two Russian airplanes last week; and Osama bin Laden himself.","4226":"Vice President Dick Cheney tells us that we're at risk of a terror attack if we make 'the wrong choice' in November.

The article quoted Mr. Zawahiri as saying on the tape, 'Bush, reinforce your security measures' and 'The Islamic nation which sent you the New York and Washington brigades has taken the firm decision to send you successive brigades to sow death and aspire to paradise.' The headline, based on those statements, said, 'In Tape, Top Aide to Bin Laden Vows New Strikes at U.S.'","423":"German officials said there was no evidence so far that directly linked the suspects to Osama bin Laden, the militant Islamic leader who is a Saudi exile.","4230":"What a convoluted road to justice for General Pinochet. It took the murder of 3,000 innocent Americans by Osama bin Laden and his terrorist fanatics to create the conditions that would force a Chilean general, who had murdered more than 3,000 of his fellow citizens, to answer in a court of law for his own acts of terrorism.","4231":"\"Some of the children have told us they were afraid that Osama bin Laden was lurking in their backyards,\" she said.","4232":"Later, he told the crowd: \"Every single one of them said our husbands didn't die on Sept. 11 because of what happened with Iraq, it's what happened with Al Qaeda, with Osama bin Laden, in Afghanistan.

Rankings for children's paperbacks do not include serials.","4234":"Officials and experts said in interviews that as Russia's conflict in Chechnya has evolved, descending from separatist bravado into barbarity, a portion of the republic's separatists have merged nationalist goals and tribal codes with the ideology and tactics of groups like Al Qaeda, whose leader, Osama bin Laden, has cited Chechen resistance as part of his global religious war.","4235":"\"Why don't you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or to the White House and engage in talks, ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace?\" Mr. Putin was quoted as telling a group of Western visitors.","4236":"Thus President Bush's acceptance speech, which included yet another of his Reagan-lite efforts to wrap himself in Normandy, was heralded by invocations of F.D.R. from nearly every speaker: Laura Bush, Tommy Franks, Zell Miller and Dick Cheney, who went so far as to inform us that he and Roosevelt share the same birthday. (Rudy Giuliani one-upped them all by equating Mr. Bush with Churchill.) Of course these World War II flashbacks had to come to a screeching halt before identifying the present Hitler, Osama bin Laden. To take the analogy that far would be to remind the audience that we had diverted troops and money from the essential war against al Qaeda and Islamic fanaticism to open an optional second front against Iraq's secular despot.","4237":"To date the pressure has not damaged performance standards. We watched a riveting if unorthodox production of Shostakovich's \"Nose\" at the Staatsoper, with the musicians dressed in gilded jumpsuits and helmets and chorus members kitted out as Islamic terrorists, led by an Osama bin Laden clone in heels. The Berlin Philharmonic, full of young Eastern Europeans, led by Sir Simon Rattle, has gone from strength to strength.","4238":"Such scenes, which enlarge the ranks of our enemies by making America look both weak and brutal, are inevitable in the guerrilla war President Bush got us into. Osama bin Laden must be smiling.","4239":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 - Three years after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency has fewer experienced case officers assigned to its headquarters unit dealing with Osama bin Laden than it did at the time of the attacks, despite repeated pleas from the unit's leaders for reinforcements, a senior C.I.A. officer with extensive counterterrorism experience has told Congress.","424":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 13\u2014 The Bush administration today singled out Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant who operates from Afghanistan, as a prime suspect in Tuesday's catastrophic terror attacks and vowed a comprehensive military campaign to demolish terrorist networks and topple regimes that harbor them.","4240":"By then Mr. Basayev was the unrivaled guerrilla leader of Chechnya, a role he played with style. Unlike Osama bin Laden, with whom he is sometimes compared, Mr. Basayev lacked a list of global grievances and the blank messianic stare. He focused his rage against Russia, and, even after the deaths of his family members, often wisecracked.","4242":"They can shoot down airplanes or helicopters, and according to testimony in federal district court in New York, 25 of them were bought in the United States by terrorists and shipped to Osama bin Laden before the United States invaded Afghanistan to root out Al Qaeda.","4243":"He returned to the theme four days later when he met with a group of American and European academics and analysts. Media accounts afterward focused on his pointed rebuff of calls to negotiate with Chechnya's separatists, whom he equated with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. More telling about his plans to come was his reference to an obscure electoral dispute in Karachayevo-Cherkessia, one of the troubled republics of the North Caucasus.","4244":"Osama bin Laden. Long beard.","4245":"How did the president who has caused so much insecurity in the world become the hero of security moms? He was, after all, in charge when Al Qaeda struck, and he was the one to send off Mrs. Niederer's son and other kids to die in a war sold on a false premise. And that conflict has, despite what Mr. Bush claims, spurred more acts of terror and been a recruiting bonanza for Osama bin Laden.","4246":"But the critics' charges of deliberate deception are also questionable, since key officials seem really to believe what they are saying. As late as February 2003, the deputy secretary of defense, Paul Wolfowitz, was pressing hard to get Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, retroactively declared an \"enemy combatant\" -- so that he could be pulled out of his Colorado prison cell and pressured into revealing his supposedly secret identity as the missing link between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. That is not the behavior of somebody cynically spinning a cover story he knows to be false.","4247":"A touch of politics shadowed the awards show. \"We missed Osama bin Laden,\" said the host, Gary Shandling. \"We got Martha Stewart.\" At another point he said, \"Don't we feel safer?\"","4248":"First, Kerry argued that Iraq was never a serious threat to the United States, that the war was never justified and that Bush's focus on Iraq was a \"profound diversion\" from the real enemy, Osama bin Laden.","4249":"He expressed intense irritation with critics of Pakistan's level of commitment to the campaign to capture the Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. \"When I read about this issue of we are not doing enough and all that, I really don't like that at all for Pakistan,\" he said, his voice rising. \"Who else is doing enough? Who else is doing anything, by the way? Only Pakistan is doing enough.\"","425":"On Wednesday, the 19 members of NATO took the unprecedented step of invoking a mutual defense clause. NATO officials denied a report in the British newspaper The Guardian saying that the alliance had already drawn up a plan to invade Afghanistan, the refuge of Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi suspected of having planned Tuesday's attacks.","4250":"The president also accused Mr. Kerry of changing his mind on the question of whether Iraq is part of the war against terrorism. In New York on Monday, Mr. Kerry mentioned Osama bin Laden four times as he argued that the Iraq operation was a distraction from other terror hot spots, but Mr. Bush said his opponent had \"acknowledged that confronting Saddam Hussein was critical to the war on terror.\"","4251":"The cleric, Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, is in custody in Brooklyn awaiting trial Jan. 10 in federal court on charges of funneling money to Osama bin Laden.","4252":"After the traditional diplomatic swirl when the General Assembly opens, Mr. Bush lunched with Mr. Annan and others at the United Nations and met with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan and with Presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, whose countries share a mountainous border region where Osama bin Laden is believed to be still at large.","4253":"Going after Saddam, as the senator says, was a diversion from our greatest enemy, Osama bin Laden. We have \"traded a dictator for a chaos that has left America less secure.\"","4254":"President Bush spoke for an hour with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan yesterday morning in a conversation devoted largely to the hunt for Osama bin Laden and terror groups, administration officials said, but he made little effort to persuade General Musharraf to hold to his promise to step down as the chief of the army.","4255":"Expanding on his theme that the nation is less secure because of the way Mr. Bush has handled Iraq, Mr. Kerry said Osama bin Laden had become \"Osama bin Forgotten.\"","4256":"The scene was very different this time around. The Kandahar airport, where I had once seen Taliban soldiers showing off their antiaircraft missiles, is now a vast American base with thousands of soldiers, as well as a 24-hour coffee shop, a North Face clothing store, a day spa and a PX the size of a Wal-Mart. Next door, what was once a base for Osama bin Laden is now an American shooting range. In downtown Kandahar, the gaudy compound of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, now houses United States Special Forces units.","4257":"The left-leaning Independent of Britain carried an editorial cartoon of Osama bin Laden putting up a Bush campaign poster saying \"4 More Years\" on a shell-pocked bit of masonry in Iraq. The cartoon seemed to be inspired by a diplomatic spat over remarks attributed to the British ambassador to Italy, Sir Ivor Roberts. After a private discussion on policy that was supposed to be off the record, Sir Ivor was quoted by an Italian newspaper as saying that Mr. Bush had become \"the best recruiting sergeant\" for Al Qaeda.","4258":"I deliberately saw 'September Tapes' without reading about it beforehand. When a note on screen announced that these tapes had been 'obtained by soldiers at the Pakistani border' and that the film company had acquired the rights to them from Northern Alliance forces, I couldn't help thinking of 'The Blair Witch Project.' The erratic camerawork was also a lot like 'Blair Witch,' the 1999 horror movie playfully posing as a documentary. I reprimanded myself for the irreverence; this was a deadly serious film about the search for Osama bin Laden.","4259":"Prosecutors had originally described Mr. Khalil as an admirer of Osama bin Laden and suggested there was a link to terrorism in the case. But in response to challenges by Mr. Khalil's defense, the prosecutors dropped any mention of terrorism during the three-week trial, which ended late Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.","426":"Pakistan borders Afghanistan, which has harbored the Islamic terrorist who may have directed this week's attacks, Osama bin Laden. Pakistan has been the principal supporter of the fanatic group that now controls most of Afghanistan, the Taliban. It would matter a lot if General Musharraf really changes sides. But will he really be able to, given the influence of Islamic extremists in Pakistan?","4260":"The American authorities have linked the group to Al Qaeda, and the kidnappers described Osama bin Laden and the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as brothers. They spoke Turkish, Ms. Tugrul said, but also claimed to be Sunni Arabs, and not Turkmen of the Shia branch of Islam. Ms. Tugrul said they also spoke a very different Turkish dialect from the Turkmen. They eventually handed the two journalists off to Arabic-speaking men in Mosul.","4261":"Abandoned houses from a real town once on the site are used as props: they are like a backlot Hollywood ghost town, with a few details added to establish a wartime Iraqi ambience: there's graffiti in fake Arabic, and two scrawled phrases in English, one dissing Osama bin Laden, the other dissing George W. Bush.","4262":"The firm won wide notice with one of the first suits brought for families of Sept. 11 victims. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan just over a month after the attacks, named as defendants Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, its Taliban rulers and the Iraqi government.","4263":"The group's latest advertisement, scheduled to go on the air Saturday, flashes images of Osama bin Laden, Mohamed Atta and terrorist bombings in Spain, Russia, New York and Washington before an announcer asks, \"Would you trust Kerry up against these fanatic killers?\" The kicker: \"President Bush didn't start this warbut he will finish it.\"","4264":"Iraq is now what it was not before the war: a haven for terrorists. George Bush made Saddam Hussein the priority. I would have made Osama bin Laden the priority.","4265":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - President Bush has been searching vainly for Osama bin Laden for three years now, so I've decided to help him out. I'm traveling through Pakistan and Afghanistan to see whether I can find Osama, bring him back in my luggage and claim that $25 million reward.","4267":"\"Iraq is now what it was not before the war -- a haven for terrorists. George Bush made Saddam Hussein the priority. I would have made Osama bin Laden the priority. As president, I will finish the job in Iraq and refocus our energies on the real war on terror.\"","4268":"There are certainly groups in Europe that see Osama bin Laden as a hero, and support jihad, or holy war, against Christians, Jews and Western civilization. But Hizb ut-Tahrir's members say that they disapprove of Al Qaeda and its methods, that their goals concern only Islamic countries, not European ones, and that they are largely intellectuals who do not resort to violence and take care not to violate the laws of their host countries.","4269":"'My hope is that we can help these people in Afghanistan and that they can live free and prosper,' Mr. Forman said from his home in Warren. 'We didn't finish the job over there; we toppled the Taliban, but al Qaeda is still lifting its head and Osama bin Laden is still at large. There's much to do.'","427":"Without Pakistan, the Taliban, who play host to the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden, would never have swept across Afghanistan and succeeded in imposing their purified and regressive form of Islam.","4270":"The People's Party campaign featured posters branded racist by their opponents. The party cited disputed statistics that predict a substantial rise in Switzerland's Muslim population and a picture of a mocked-up Swiss passport in the name of Osama bin Laden.","4271":"The intensity of television advertisements broadcast this weekend -- a blur of images of Osama bin Laden, Mohamed Atta and explosions on the streets of Iraq -- signaled the campaigns' new phase and the importance that both sides attach to the debates, aides to the campaigns said.","4272":"Exhibit A is, of course, Osama bin Laden, whom Mr. Bush promised to get \"dead or alive,\" then dropped from his speeches after a botched operation at Tora Bora let him get away. And it's not just bin Laden: most analysts believe that Al Qaeda, which might have been crushed if Mr. Bush hadn't diverted resources and attention to the war in Iraq, is as dangerous as ever.","4274":"If that name does not immediately ring a bell, think of Hostess Twinkies and Wonder bread. Interstate makes them. Evidently, consumers are not buying them as they once did. Accepted wisdom is that all of these companies are suffering because of diet fads that have made carbohydrates the Osama bin Laden of nutrients.","4275":"A clear majority of Americans believe that we are heading in the wrong direction. The reasons are obvious. The situation in Iraq is getting worse. Osama bin Laden is alive and plotting against us. About 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. Forty-five million Americans are living without health insurance. Medicare premiums are the highest they've ever been. Environmental protections have been eviscerated.","4276":"An Egyptian militant with ties to Osama bin Laden sought to negotiate with United States authorities after the bombing of the destroyer Cole in October 2000, offering to halt such attacks in exchange for the release of a fundamentalist Muslim cleric held in an American prison, according to evidence presented in federal court yesterday.","4277":"MEERWALA, Pakistan - I'm still trying to help out President Bush by tracking down Osama bin Laden. After poking through remote parts of Pakistan, asking for a tall Arab with a beard, I can't say I've earned that $25 million reward.","4278":"After the 1998 bombings of American Embassies in East Africa, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes against Osama bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan. Should we have responded more vigorously then, and to the bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole in 2000? Was there any additional military option before 9/11 that would have made sense?","4279":"CAIRO, Sept. 29 - A judge in Yemen sentenced two men to death and four others to prison terms of up to 10 years on Wednesday for the deadly attack in 2000 against the American destroyer Cole. The convictions were the first ones stemming from the maritime suicide bombing, which provided an early glimpse of the brazen nature of Osama bin Laden's global terror network.","428":"Among Mr. Massoud's followers, the attack in which he was wounded has been attributed to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist leader suspected in the attacks that caused devastation in New York and Washington on Tuesday. The Massoud aides said the bomb, concealed in a camera or in a body belt worn by one of the attackers, bore the hallmarks of a bin Laden operation.","4280":"Both men made errors that appeared to be mainly a matter of misspeaking under the pressure of the moment. But Mr. Kerry scored an important point when the president made a more significant slip and talked about the need to go to war because \"the enemy attacked us.\" The person who sent planes smashing into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Mr. Kerry reminded the audience, was Osama bin Laden, who was operating from Afghanistan, not Saddam Hussein in Iraq.","4281":"Mr. Kerry -- I believe in being strong and resolute and determined. And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim. And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking it off to Iraq where the 9/11 commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein. And where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.","4282":"A moment later, Mr. Kerry said: \"The president just said something extraordinarily revealing and, frankly, very important in this debate. In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said the enemy attacked us. Saddam Hussein didn't attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us. Al Qaeda attacked us.\"","4283":"At one point, Mr. Bush burst out a spontaneous answer to a question that Mr. Kerry had posed only rhetorically, declaring before the moderator, Jim Lehrer, had recognized him, \"Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.\" At another point, after Mr. Bush justified his use of pre-emptive military action by saying \"the enemy attacked us,\" Mr. Kerry pointed out that that enemy had not been Saddam Hussein, leading Mr. Bush to jump in to say, \"Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.\"","4284":"Senator John Kerry was waiting for that moment. \"Saddam Hussein didn't attack us,\" Mr. Kerry shot back. \"Osama bin Laden attacked us.\" Mr. Bush, he said, had strengthened Al Qaeda with a war in Iraq that was a \"diversion\" in the broader war on terrorism.","4285":"Mr. Kerry, a competitive debater in high school and college, had been putting pen to pad in mock debate sessions with his staff for weeks. Not only did it help him avoid the fidgeting and face-making that became instant fodder for criticism of Mr. Bush, it forced him to stay focused. And, two-thirds of the way through the 90-minute exchange, it led him to jump on Mr. Bush's justification for a pre-emptive strike on Iraq -- \"the enemy attacked us\" -- to point out that the architect of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was Osama bin Laden, not Saddam Hussein.","4286":"Dr. Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden, the top Qaeda leader, are among those who have evaded American capture since the Sept. 11 attacks, and government officials said there had been no indication that any of the senior leaders had died.","4287":"KABUL, Afghanistan - My quest to help President Bush find Osama bin Laden has taken me into Afghanistan, where I've offended the locals by scrutinizing every unusually tall woman in a burka. But so far, no sign of Osama.","4288":"Kerry, on the other hand, defined the enemy in narrow, concrete terms. He emphasized that it was Osama bin Laden who attacked us. He emphasized the need to defeat Al Qaeda's network. He called Iraq a diversion from defeating that network.","4289":"His adversary is Rifai Ahmed Taha, an associate of Osama bin Laden who was named by Washington in a 1998 executive order as a \"specially designated terrorist.\" Mr. Taha is accused of conspiring in the 1997 attack at the ancient Egyptian ruins in Luxor, where 58 foreign tourists were killed. Public outrage over those killings led the Islamic Group to announce the cease-fire later that year.","429":"Despite evidence suggesting that some of those who carried out the massive attack on the United States this week might have been Saudi citizens or at least linked to another former Saudi resident, Osama bin Laden, it remains to be seen to what extent the kingdom will aid the United States in taking on his shadowy movement. Some Saudi officials noted that names bandied about this week as armed and dangerous men and even suicide pilots turned out to be average Saudi citizens sitting quietly home in Jidda and Mecca, their flight training over.","4290":"In this spring's classic \"South Park\" parody, \"The Passion of the Jew,\" in which Mr. Gibson's movie tosses the community into a religious war, one of the kids concludes: \"If you want to be Christian, that's cool, but you should focus on what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages, and it ends up with really bad results.\" He has a point. It's far from clear that Mr. Bush's eschatology and his religious vanity are leading to good results now. The all-seeing president who could pronounce Vladimir Putin saintly by looking into his \"soul\" is now refusing to acknowledge that the reverse may be true. The general in charge of tracking down Osama bin Laden, William G. Boykin, has earned cheers in some quarters for giving speeches at churches proclaiming that Mr. Bush is \"in the White House because God put him there\" to lead the \"army of God\" against \"a guy named Satan.\" But all that preaching didn't get his day job done; he hasn't snared the guy named Osama he was supposed to bring back \"dead or alive.\"","4291":"In races Republicans have on their target list, they have not given up on unseating Senator Patty Murray in Washington, where she has held a comfortable lead. Her opponent, Representative George Nethercutt, is running a commercial using video of past comments by Ms. Murray regarding Osama bin Laden to suggest she excused the Sept. 11 attacks.","4292":"Mr. Bush wanted strict time limits, presumably so that he could deliver scripted responses, but as the debate progressed he seemed unable to fill out the time allotted. Mr. Kerry's 7,215 words included about twice as many references to Osama bin Laden and nearly four times as many to weapons of mass destruction as Mr. Bush made in his 6,136.","4293":"THE French anti-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re once memorably compared the threat of international Islamic terrorism to the AIDS virus, a constantly mutating contagion, liable to vanish and then reappear in unexpected strains. The analogy may not go far enough, for the world has never faced a plague so virulently unpredictable as that incubated and released by Osama bin Laden: at once worldwide and disparate, fed by poverty but financed by Saudi millions, cropping up now in the alleys of Khartoum, now in the Afghan mountains, the skies over New York or the Madrid railway; self-contradicting, sometimes self-defeating, but remarkably durable and possibly incurable.","4294":"'NBC announced yesterday that Conan O'Brien would succeed Jay Leno as host of the 'Tonight show' when Mr. Leno's contract expired in 2009 . . .

Al Qaeda attacked us.\"","4297":"Many of the hundreds of reporters, who were not in the actual debate hall but watching on televisions atop rolling carts next door in the university's \"Wellness Center,\" hooted when Mr. Bush appeared to stumble, blurting out haltingly, \"Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us -- I know that,\" in response to Senator John Kerry's implication that he had conflated Iraq and Al Qaeda.","4298":"Judge Koeltl has repeatedly instructed jurors not to apply to Ms. Stewart any of the evidence showing the links between the militants on Mr. Sattar's calls and known terrorists, including Osama bin Laden. But given the long trial and complex evidence, the distinctions may be difficult for jurors to make.","4299":"In the course of 15 questions Mr. Kerry settled a few points: there will be no military draft if he is elected unless the nation's survival is at stake; he hopes Osama bin Laden is caught in \"10 minutes, 5 minutes,\" never mind the political fallout; and while he is a hunter and a sportsman, he does not hunt deer with an AK-47 and thinks the president and Congress \"played a cute game\" in letting the assault weapons ban expire.","43":"AMMAN, Jordan, March 28\u2014 Jordan today indicted 28 Arabs linked to the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden on charges stemming from what officials say was a conspiracy to attack Americans and Israelis during New Year's celebrations.","430":"For now, at least, the one state where American military power might be effectively used is Afghanistan, where the Taliban-led government is host to Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in Tuesday's attack. But removing the Taliban from power and hunting down Mr. bin Laden's Afghanistan-based followers would be no easy task, even for America's powerful armed forces.","4300":"\"I have seen the answer to that question migrate in the intelligence community over the period of a year in the most amazing way,\" Mr. Rumsfeld said when asked about ties between Mr. Hussein and the terror network run by Osama bin Laden. Senior administration officials cited the existence of ties between them as a rationale for war on Iraq.","4302":"KABUL, Afghanistan - I had an inspiration about where Osama bin Laden might be hiding. But when I visited the women's detention center in Kabul, there was no sign of him.","4303":"But Mr. Edwards was on the attack from the moment the moderator, Gwen Ifill, turned to him, defending Mr. Kerry even as he attacked Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney. He underscored what has been the central challenge Democrats have offered to Mr. Bush's Iraq war: that it was a distraction from the war against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","4304":"He added that he had no new information about the location of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, who intelligence analysts believe is still in the Afghan-Pakistani border region.","4305":"When Ms. Ifill asked if a Kerry-Edwards administration would have acted differently when confronted with the threat of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Edwards said that Mr. Hussein \"needed to be confronted\" but that United Nations weapons inspectors should have been given more time. He said the American invasion of March 2003 had distracted attention fom Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, who were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.","4306":"But Mr. Edwards was on the attack from the moment the moderator, Gwen Ifill, turned to him, defending Mr. Kerry even as he attacked Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney. Most of all, he underscored what has been the central challenge Democrats have offered to Mr. Bush's Iraq war: That it had been a distraction from the war against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","4307":"MR. EDWARDS -- Here's what it means, it means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted. John Kerry and I have consistently said that. It's why we voted for the resolution. But it also means it needed to be done the right way. And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared, that we gave the weapons inspectors the time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction, that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th.","4309":"Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law Muhammad Jamal Khalifa, who was Mr. bin Laden's roommate during the Afghan war against Soviet occupation, is also interviewed. Mr. Khalifa describes Mr. bin Laden as a \"very, very nice person.\" They became so close that, as Mr. Khalifa puts it: \"Osama, he decided to let me marry his sister. So of course it's something, it cannot be refused.\" (The film does not mention that Mr. Khalifa was under investigation for terrorist links in the mid-1990's by law enforcement agencies in the in the United States. He has denied all such charges.)","431":"Tough talk from a Taliban leader in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden has found protection. A17","4310":"A former Kuwaiti information minister, Sad bin Tefla, wrote an article in a London Arabic daily, Al Sharq Al Awsat, last Sept. 11 entitled \"We Are All Bin Laden.\" He asked why Muslim scholars and clerics had eagerly supported fatwas condemning Salman Rushdie to death after he wrote a novel deemed insulting to Islam, \"The Satanic Verses,\" but to this day no Muslim cleric has issued a fatwa condemning Osama bin Laden for murdering nearly 3,000 innocent civilians, badly damaging Islam.","4311":"The president was right when he concluded that Saddam Hussein was a menace who needed to be removed from power. He understands that our enemies are not confined to Al Qaeda, and certainly not just to Osama bin Laden, who is probably trapped in his hide-out in Afghanistan. As the bipartisan 9/11 commission reported, there were contacts between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime going back a decade. We will win the war against global terror only by staying on the offensive and confronting terrorists and state sponsors of terror -- wherever they are. Right now, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Qaeda ally, is a dangerous threat. He is in Iraq.","4312":"Prosecutors in the trial of Lynne F. Stewart, a lawyer accused of aiding terrorism, rested their case yesterday with a jolt to the jury, rereading vicious threats against Americans by a client of hers and suggesting links to Osama bin Laden in their evidence against her.","4313":"Again, despite rules limiting them from questioning each other directly, the candidates produced real exchanges. After Mr. Kerry accused him of diverting attention from the war in Afghanistan and the hunt for Osama bin Laden in order to attack Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush had a crisp rejoinder.","4315":"Mr. Kerry declared that Mr. Bush's invasion of Iraq had in fact made the United States more vulnerable to a terrorist attack at home. \"This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside, and Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons,\" he said. \"He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.\"","4316":"KABUL, Afghanistan - I'm sorry, President Bush. Although I searched all over Pakistan and Afghanistan, I couldn't find Osama bin Laden -- except in my dreams:","4317":"In their first debate, in Florida, an austere debate club format that leashed the two candidates to identical lecterns, Mr. Kerry remained confident; Mr. Bush grew peevish, defensive and rattled. When Mr. Kerry said that it was Al Qaeda that attacked on Sept. 11, not Iraq, Mr. Bush sounded more like a sullen schoolboy than a president as he retorted: \"Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us. I know that.\"","4318":"LONDON - FROM a safe house in Falluja last January, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi wrote a rambling, 17-page letter to Osama bin Laden. The letter asked Mr. bin Laden to send Al Qaeda operatives to Iraq to help Mr. Zarqawi continue the guerrilla war against the American occupiers and their allies.","4319":"Kerry told me he would stop terrorists by going after them ruthlessly with the military, and he faulted Bush, as he often does, for choosing to use Afghan militias, instead of American troops, to pursue Osama bin Laden into the mountains of Tora Bora, where he disappeared. \"I'm certainly, you know, not going to take second seat to anybody, to nobody, in my willingness to seek justice and set America on a course -- to make America safe,\" Kerry told me. \"And that requires destroying terrorists. And I'm committed to doing that. But I think I have a better way of doing it. I can do it more effectively.\"","432":"As American attention turns inexorably toward the Taliban -- which rules most of Afghanistan, is supported by Pakistan and shelters Osama bin Laden -- Indian and American officials have held a flurry of meetings. In the event of an attack, it is expected that India would share intelligence on the location of Afghan and Pakistani training camps, and offer access to Indian military bases where American aircraft could refuel.","4320":"The formally liberal mother who expressed her belief that George W. Bush is more likely to keep us safe perhaps doesn't recall that in August 2001 the president was briefed specifically that Osama bin Laden planned to attack us in the United States and that terrorists were at flying schools here. What was his response? He went on vacation.","4321":"\"I thought Kerry did an excellent job of clarifying his differences with Bush on things like Bush's failure to reach a consensus with our allies,\" Mr. Olson said. \"He made a clear distinction between the removal of weapons of mass destruction and the removal of Saddam Hussein as our national goal, and a clear distinction between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein as the main target of our war on terror.\"","4322":"DENVER, Oct. 10 - The candidates for Colorado's tightly contested open Senate seat, the beer heir Peter H. Coors and state Attorney General Ken Salazar, clashed on Sunday over whether Osama bin Laden deserves the death penalty.","4323":"\"I have a son with the military, in a combat-ready unit,\" Mrs. Marshall said. \"I'm scared to death every day. I'm disappointed about the Bush program. I was all for it when he said we were going to fight terror. But they know for a fact where that 9/11 attack originated, and it wasn't Iraq. If they had concentrated all that effort in Afghanistan, maybe by now they would have him, that other fool\" -- meaning Osama bin Laden.","4324":"\"Considering that George Bush doesn't think we can win the war on terror, let Osama bin Laden escape and rushed into Iraq with no plan to win the peace, it's no surprise that his campaign is distorting every word John Kerry has ever said,\" said Phil Singer, a Kerry spokesman.","4325":"The story of the Bush foreign policy is one of startling change: from the promise of a \"humble\" approach in 2000 through the \"dead or alive\" search for the elusive Osama bin Laden to the articulation of a bold, pro-active doctrine summed up last month by Mr. Bush, when he told the United Nations:","4326":"Mr. Safire, if not this president, should recognize the rich irony of such a slogan applied in the debates, when you have amply reported how 9/11 has become part of the national conversation. Apparently, you can run and hide from Mr. Bush with impunity if your name is Osama bin Laden. Paul Batsel New York, Oct. 11, 2004","4327":"The article also misstated the annual income figures that place taxpayers in the categories of wealthiest 10 percent and wealthiest 1 percent, as calculated by the Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. The wealthiest 10 percent earn more than $112,000 (not $70,000), and the wealthiest 1 percent earn more than $357,000 (not $290,000). Correction: October 16, 2004, Saturday An article on Thursday examining statements made by the presidential candidates during their Wednesday debate misstated the date of a news conference in which President Bush said he was 'not that concerned' about Osama bin Laden. (In the debate, Mr. Kerry criticized him for having made that comment six months after declaring that Mr. bin Laden must be 'caught dead or alive,' and Mr. Bush denied having made it.) He spoke in March 2002 -- not 2003.","4328":"MR. KERRY -- Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of him, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords and Osama bin Laden escaped. Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive this president was asked, where's Osama bin Laden? And he said, \"I don't know. I don't really think him about very much. I'm not that concerned.\" We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.","433":"'If America is now pointing fingers at us, it will be the third imperialistic attack on our country,' he said. 'During the British and Russian invasions of years past, there was no Osama bin Laden or Taliban, so don't blame Osama. I swear by Allah that if we hand over Osama, even then the Americans will look for excuses to attack.'","4330":"But whatever the motive, the commercials are apt to keep coming. The Progress for America Voter Fund, which has run advertisements flashing pictures of Osama bin Laden and other terrorists, is planning to begin a $14 million advertising campaign Tuesday, said Brian McCabe, the group's president. He would not discuss details, saying only that there is \"an element of surprise.\" The group reported raising more than $28 million and spending almost $23 million in the third quarter, according to the Center for Public Integrity, which tracks the reports.","4331":"An article on Thursday examining statements made by the presidential candidates during their Wednesday debate misstated the date of a news conference in which President Bush said he was 'not that concerned' about Osama bin Laden.

He spoke in March 2002 -- not 2003.","4332":"Mr. Ashcroft appeared on TV time and again to announce sensational arrests of people who turned out to be either innocent, harmless braggarts or extremely low-level sympathizers of Osama bin Laden who, while perhaps wishing to do something terrible, lacked the means. The Justice Department cannot claim one major successful terrorism prosecution, and has squandered much of the trust and patience the American people freely gave in 2001. Other nations, perceiving that the vast bulk of the prisoners held for so long at Guant\u00e1namo Bay came from the same line of ineffectual incompetents or unlucky innocents, and seeing the awful photographs from the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, were shocked that the nation that was supposed to be setting the world standard for human rights could behave that way.","4333":"MOST EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC LINE: Mr. Kerry's quick response after Mr. Bush justified the Iraq war by saying, \"The enemy attacked us.\" Mr. Kerry called that \"extraordinarily revealing\" and said, \"Saddam Hussein didn't attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us.\" Mr. Bush just drew more attention to it by peevishly responding, \"Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us. I know that.\"","4334":"That did not improve with the 1989 coup that brought to power the current head of state, Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir; instead, it almost seemed Bashir was intent on building his nation's outlaw status. He expanded the use of Arab tribal militias in the south, and the death toll there ultimately exceeded two million. In a vicious game of round robin, Sudan supported a range of guerrilla groups against its neighbors, as those same neighbors supported guerrilla groups or fomented rebellion against Sudan. By the late 1990's, Khartoum had gained such notoriety as a haven for Islamic fundamentalist radicals -- Osama bin Laden was its most famous temporary resident -- that it was slapped with American economic sanctions and then hit with a retaliatory air strike after the bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","4335":"Local races are following suit. Here in Santa Fe, State Senator Richard M. Romero, a Democrat running to unseat Representative Heather A. Wilson, a Republican, has a commercial showing Osama bin Laden's face and an airplane taking off as an announcer criticizes Ms. Wilson for voting against required air cargo inspections for passenger planes, \"a favor to terrorists.\"","4336":"Looking back at the months directly following 9/11, virtually every leading military analyst seems to believe that rather than using Afghan proxies, we should have used more American troops, deployed more quickly, to pursue Osama bin Laden in the mountains of Tora Bora. Many have also been critical of the president's handling of Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 19 hijackers; despite Bush's setting goals in the so-called \"financial war on terror,\" the Saudis failed to cooperate with American officials in hunting for the financial sources of terror. Still, the nation wanted bold action and was delighted to get it. Bush's approval rating approached 90 percent. Meanwhile, the executive's balance between analysis and resolution, between contemplation and action, was being tipped by the pull of righteous faith.","4337":"After the Sept. 11 attacks, a file with information on Plum Island was found by American forces in Afghanistan in the Kabul residence of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a former nuclear scientist from Pakistan whom American officials have identified as an associate of Osama bin Laden. Last year, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that laboratory officials \"have not adequately controlled access to the pathogens.\"","4338":"In Italy last November, the Interior Ministry expelled a Senegalese-born imam after he called for suicide bombings and declared a \"blood pact\" with Osama bin Laden.","4339":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 17 - Iraq's most wanted militant has pledged his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, according to a message posted Sunday on Islamist Web sites.","434":"Experts called it too early to say what the demographic differences might mean about the shifting dynamics of international terrorism. Perhaps, they said, loyalty to Osama bin Laden is even more powerful than the religious and nationalist fanaticism that has been behind other suicide attacks. Perhaps the size of the target attracted more sophisticated candidates. Or perhaps the hatred of the United States and Western culture is seeping into a broader spectrum of the world's disaffected populations.","4340":"INTERNATIONAL A3-11 Weapons Buyout Effort Is Accelerating in Iraq Prime Minister Ayad Allawi ventured into the heart of Baghdad's hostile Shiite district to salute the Mahdi Army for surrendering more than 1,000 of its heavy weapons in return for cash. Officials said the buyout period would be extended and perhaps begun in other cities. A1 Iraq's most-wanted militant has pledged his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, according to a message posted on Islamist Web sites. The militant, Abu Musab Zarqawi, is believed responsible for a number of bombings and beheadings. A10 Little rebuilding has been done in some of the most heavily damaged zones of Najaf. The Iraqi government has taken over responsibility for the reconstruction, and both American and Iraqi officials say they have made recent progress in compensating people. A11 Marines and Special Forces soldiers captured 17 men suspected of working with the insurgency, including a couple of midlevel leaders and a senior aide to a man believed to be organizing guerrillas. A11 Referendum on Gaza Refused Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel rejected a demand by Jewish settler leaders that he hold a national referendum on his plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. Mr. Sharon says he sees no future for Jews in Gaza and intends to remove all 8,000 settlers next year. A6 Vote in Belarus as Expected Belarussians voted on a constitutional referendum that would allow their country's authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, to seek unlimited terms in office. After a truncated campaign marred by harassment and corruption accusations, the result was considered a foregone conclusion. A3 Militants Said to Use Drugs Forensic analysis has determined that the militants who seized the school in Beslan last month were dependent on drugs. Russian law enforcement officials and politicians have said that those who plan such attacks use hard drugs to coerce suicide bombers or to induce a semi-alert state. A8 Aristide Blamed for Violence Haiti's interim prime minister, G?rd Latortue, accused the ousted president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, of directing violence from exile. Meanwhile, 95 Chinese police officers arrived for China's first United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Western Hemisphere. They will train and provide security. A3 Talks on Darfur Held in Tripoli Leaders from Sudan and four regional states wound up a summit meeting in Tripoli with a joint statement rejecting any foreign intervention in the crisis-torn Sudanese region of Darfur. A8 NATIONAL A12-15 As Election Day Nears, New Legal Battles Begin As the secretary of state of Ohio, J. Kenneth Blackwell, a Republican, has issued a series of rulings on obscure issues like provisional ballots, among others. Democrats sued to block a directive that they say will require election workers to reject thousands of registrations by first-time Democratic voters. A1 Texas is the linchpin of the Republicans' national strategy to maintain or expand their slim hold on the House, with 5 of the 35 most competitive races in the country. How Texas Democrats threatened by redistricting fare may determine the shape of the Congress for years to come. A1 Accusing President Bush of plotting to cut Social Security benefits, Senator John Kerry told voters in Florida and Ohio that Mr. Bush's plans for the retirement program could cost them as much as 45 percent of their monthly checks.

The gallery said it had been advised by lawyers that it might influence a trial in London. Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, whose trial began on Oct. 8, is charged with shooting and beating civilians at checkpoints while he was a commander in the Sarobi district of Kabul Province from 1992 to 1996. 'The House of Osama bin Laden' is a 12-minute interactive digital reconstruction, which allows visitors to explore a remote house in Afghanistan formerly occupied by Osama bin Laden. The film was created when the artists Langlands &amp; Bell were commissioned by the Imperial War Museum to visit Afghanistan in 2002, after the Taliban was overthrown, and has been exhibited at the war museum. A spokesman for Tate Britain said the withdrawal of the work would not affect Langlands &amp; Bell's chances of winning the Turner Prize, Britain's leading contemporary art award, because all members of the jury had seen it. Other artists shortlisted for this year's prize, to be awarded on Dec. 6, are Kutlug Ataman, Jeremy Deller and Yinka Shonabare. PAM KENT","4343":"On more than one occasion, Senator Kerry has referred to the fight at Tora Bora in Afghanistan during late 2001 as a missed opportunity for America. He claims that our forces had Osama bin Laden cornered and allowed him to escape. How did it happen? According to Mr. Kerry, we \"outsourced\" the job to Afghan warlords. As commander of the allied forces in the Middle East, I was responsible for the operation at Tora Bora, and I can tell you that the senator's understanding of events doesn't square with reality.","4344":"WILKES-BARRE, Pa., Oct. 19 - Senator John Kerry came here Tuesday to discuss Social Security and fiscal discipline, accusing President Bush of putting at risk \"the retirement of millions of people in our country\" and \"the future of our children.\" But he began with an assault on the failure to capture Osama bin Laden and a vow to \"make a fresh start with new credibility in Iraq.\"","4345":"In a rare disclosure of casualty figures, a senior general said 171 Pakistani soldiers and paramilitary forces had died since the country began a series of military operations in the spring to drive suspected Islamic militants from remote tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Lt. Gen. Safdar Hussain Shah said Pakistani forces had killed 246 militants, including about 100 foreigners, and captured another 579. He also said that they had scoured nearly the entire area and that he did not believe Osama bin Laden could be hiding there. General Shah estimated that just 100 militants remain in the tribal areas, a sharp decrease from the 500 to 600 officials said were present last spring. Mohammed Khan (NYT)","4346":"Beyond the tangle of political blogs, you will find on the Internet assorted bits of political animation. One kind in particular has been gaining ground since Sept. 11, 2001. It's a mutant form born of the marriage of video games and Dada photomontage. Shortly after the terrorist attacks, an animated cartoon of Osama bin Laden, called \"Nowhere to Run\" and set to the tune of \"The Banana Boat Song,\" appeared on the Internet, circulating widely for months in e-mail messages.","4347":"Mr. Bush on Wednesday also criticized Mr. Kerry for saying recently that Sept. 11 \"didn't change me much at all,\" and cited as proof of \"how wrong his thinking is\" the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the 38-year-old Jordanian militant who on Sunday pledged his loyalty to Osama bin Laden in a message posted on Islamist Web sites.","4348":"The United States was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. The president responded by turning most of the nation's firepower on Saddam Hussein and Iraq. When Mr. Bush was asked by the journalist Bob Woodward if he had consulted with former President Bush about the decision to invade Iraq, the president replied: \"He is the wrong father to appeal to in terms of strength. There is a higher father that I appeal to.\"","4349":"A classified annex sent by Mr. Feith to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Oct. 27, 2003, which was disclosed two weeks later by The Weekly Standard, asserted that 'Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein had an operational relationship from the early 1990's to 2003,' and concluded, 'There can no longer be any serious argument about whether Saddam Hussein's Iraq worked with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to plot against Americans.'","435":"At the same time, the trail of terror -- much of it, officials say, either directly organized or inspired by Osama bin Laden -- shows a remarkable coherence in structure and operations that is frustrating government efforts to extinguish the threat.","4350":"The Progress for America Voter Fund, which gained notoriety for advertisements that flashed images of Osama bin Laden and other terrorists, spent more than $5 million to support Mr. Bush, according to the Center for Public Integrity, which tracks campaign financing.","4351":"It's long been obvious that the allegations about Saddam Hussein's dangerous weapons and alliance with Osama bin Laden were false. But as the election draws closer, the remaining question is to what extent President Bush's team knew the allegations were wrong and used them anyway to persuade Americans to back the invasion of Iraq.","4353":"While he believes the F.B.I. deserved much of that criticism, he suggests we as a nation went overboard. In the book's strongest sections, he draws a straight line from the anti-F.B.I. hysteria of the 70's to the quiescent, gun-shy bureau that slept while Osama bin Laden crept inside our borders. For 30 years the F.B.I. worried less about terrorists and threats to the nation's security than about violating civil liberties. As a result, it all but halted domestic surveillance of potential terrorists, Powers says, blinding the country to real dangers. And so, while he harshly criticizes Louis Freeh's 90's-era F.B.I. for a smorgasbord of failings, \"Broken\" ultimately gives the bureau a pass on 9/11. \"If you beat a dog every time it barks, do not be surprised when it lets a thief into the house,\" he writes. \"The price we paid for beating the bureau for barking was a bureau that would not bark.\"","4354":"The question isn't whether we definitely had Osama bin Laden cornered in Afghanistan at Tora Bora. It's whether we've done all in our power to capture him. Had we sent our entire army after Osama bin Laden -- as we did after Saddam Hussein -- would he be still at large?","4355":"President Bush, when asked in his first debate with Senator Kerry whether he had made removing Saddam Hussein a higher priority than capturing Osama bin Laden, said, 'We've got the capability of doing both.'","4356":"He flaunted his Spanish in an emotional appeal for votes. \"This is absolutely the most important election of our lifetime -- \u00e9sta es la elecci\u00f3n m\u00e1s importante de nuestras vidas,\" Mr. Kerry said. Even as he tried to emphasize a positive plan for the future, Mr. Kerry slammed Mr. Bush for his pursuit of terrorists, saying \"Osama bin Laden just walked out the back door\" of the mountains of Tora Bora because the administration \"outsourced the job\" of catching him to Afghan warlords. Here in Pueblo, Mr. Kerry pointed out a man in the audience who served with him on Swift boats in the Vietnam War, and vowed, \"with the same energy that Wayne and I put in going after Viet Cong and trying to win for our country, I pledge to you, I will hunt down, capture or kill the terrorists.\"","4358":"In devising the new system, many officials said they had Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda in mind. But in picking through the hundreds of detainees at Guant?mo Bay, military investigators have struggled to find more than a dozen they can tie directly to significant terrorist acts, officials said. While important Qaeda figures have been captured and held by the C.I.A., administration officials said they were reluctant to bring those prisoners before tribunals they still consider unreliable.","4359":"The murder of dozens of Iraqi Army recruits over the weekend is being attributed to the forces of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who has been identified by the Bush administration as a leading terrorist and a supposed link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. That was not true before the war -- as multiple investigations have shown. But the breakdown of order since the invasion has changed all that. This terrorist, who has claimed many attacks on occupation forces and the barbaric murder of hostages, recently swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden and renamed his group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.","436":"And the realization that all our security systems failed. Terrorists could live among us as a fifth column, drinking beer in our bars and getting Americans to unwittingly train them to kill other Americans -- even when they drove a car sporting a pro-Osama bin Laden sticker.","4360":"At every stop, Mr. Bush has added a new line of attack on Mr. Kerry, saying he was twisting the facts when he asserted, in the presidential debates, that Mr. Bush let Osama bin Laden escape in the mountains of Tora Bora by \"subcontracting\" the pursuit to unreliable tribal allies.","4361":"THE cover illustration for The New Yorker of March 3, 2003, was a hoot. It showed Osama bin Laden on a subway train leaning over seated riders to study the map. There he was, truly Osama bin Forgotten, ignored by New Yorkers heeding the unwritten subway rule that eye contact is to be avoided at all cost.","4362":"The embodiment of this year's good news is an optimist. I asked him recently when he expected Osama bin Laden to be caught. He replied, \"You can't be a fugitive forever.\"","4363":"If Mr. Bush were a private citizen, I would admire his tenacity, just as I respect Barry Goldwater, Red Sox fans and Flat-Earthers. But for a president, I wish we had a clear-eyed thinker who understood the difference between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, or between a stuffed dog and a stuffed cat.","4364":"She said tried to separate her client in the public's mind from Islamic terrorists who in the mid-1990's were becoming more prominent, including Osama bin Laden.","4365":"As he raced from Wisconsin to Nevada and on to New Mexico and Iowa, Mr. Kerry accused the president of diverting American forces and intelligence operatives to Iraq from the hunt in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. He said this had \"allowed Osama to get away\" and allowed Al Qaeda to spread to other countries.","4366":"Senator John Kerry in Sioux City, Iowa 'The Bush administration first tried to convince the American people that this was not a big deal -- not a big deal that 380 tons of high-grade explosives were now likely in the hands of terrorists and insurgents. Then White House officials said guarding explosive dumps was not a high priority -- but guarding the Iraqi Oil Ministry apparently was. As more information was revealed in the press, the White House switched to their most comfortable position: the situation was bad, but it was not their responsibility. Vice President Cheney, who is becoming the chief minister of disinformation, echoed that it's not the administration's fault and even criticized those who raised the subject. This is a growing scandal, and the American people deserve a full and honest explanation of how it happened and what this president is going to do about it. As more facts have emerged, we've learned just how disingenuous the White House has become.' President Bush in Lititz, Pa. 'Now the senator is making wild charges about missing explosives when his top foreign policy adviser admits, quote, 'We do not know the facts.' Think about that. The senator's denigrating the action of our troops and commanders in the field without knowing the facts. Unfortunately, that's part of a pattern of saying almost anything to get elected, like when Senator Kerry charged that our military failed to get Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora even though our top military commander, Gen. Tommy Franks, said the senator's understanding of events does not square with reality and our intelligence reports placed bin Laden in any of several different countries at the time. Our military is now investigating a number of possible scenarios, including that the explosives may have been moved before our troops even arrived at the site. This investigation is important and it's ongoing, and a political candidate who jumps to conclusions without knowing the facts is not a person you want as your commander in chief.'","4367":"Mr. Bush ignored his own experts' warnings that Osama bin Laden planned to attack inside the U.S., that an invasion of Iraq could create a toxic partnership between outside terrorists and Baathists and create sympathy for them across the Islamic world, that Donald Rumsfeld was planning a war and occupation without enough troops, that Saddam's aluminum tubes were not for nuclear purposes, that U.S. troops should safeguard 380 tons of sealed explosives that could bring down planes and buildings, and that, after the invasion, Iraq could erupt into civil war.","4368":"Mr. Bush also criticized Mr. Kerry as \"throwing out the wild claim\" that the American military passed up the chance to capture Osama bin Laden in the caves of Tora Bora, Afghanistan, in fall 2001.","4369":"The thing to always keep in mind about our troops in Iraq is that they were sent to fight the wrong war. America's clearly defined and unmistakable enemy, Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda, was in Afghanistan. So the men and women fighting and dying in Iraq were thrown into a pointless, wholly unnecessary conflict.","4370":"According to a 65-page indictment that was read in court on Thursday, Mr. Bashir read a message from Osama bin Laden to Jemaah Islamiyah recruits at a training camp in the Philippines, calling on them to kill Americans and their allies.","4371":"Letting Osama get away -- Just before the story about Al Qaqaa broke, the Bush-Cheney campaign was frantically trying to debunk John Kerry's statement that Mr. Bush let Osama bin Laden get away when he was cornered at Tora Bora. That getaway, Mr. Kerry asserts, was possible because the administration \"outsourced\" the job of closing off escape routes to local Afghan warlords.","4372":"In the video shown on Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite news network, the group holding Ms. Borcz-Kalifa called itself the Abu Bakr Salafist Brigade, referring to the extremely conservative Salafiya branch of Sunni Islam that is followed by Osama bin Laden.","4373":"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 29 - The broadcast of a new videotape from Osama bin Laden jolted the presidential campaign on Friday, bringing quick reactions from both President Bush, who vowed that Americans \"will not be intimidated or influenced,\" and Senator John Kerry, who said Americans \"are absolutely united in our determination to hunt down and destroy\" the terrorists.","4374":"It's a good thing Mr. Bush tried to be humble, or the U.S. would have an approval rating even lower than 5 percent in Jordan, and Osama bin Laden's approval rating in Pakistan would be higher than 65 percent.","4375":"Mr. Agha's group is based in Pakistan and has \"a direct connection with Osama bin Laden,\" Dr. Laghmani said. The group was thought to have carried out only three or four minor attacks until now, Dr. Laghmani said.

Thomas Irvine St. Charles, Ill., Nov. 1, 2004","4409":"Officials said that absence of any tangible sign of an attack had led them to a fresh assessment of the possible significance of a recent videotape by Osama bin Laden, which was first broadcast Friday by the Arab-language satellite network Al Jazeera and transmitted by television outlets around the world.","4410":"Vice President Dick Cheney ended his campaign on Monday with a new accusation against Mr. Kerry, saying the Democratic candidate consulted polls before deciding how to react to the Osama bin Laden tape on Friday. The Kerry campaign denied the assertion, saying the vice president offered no evidence. Mr. Cheney spoke in Colorado Springs, a heavily Republican community, after an overnight trip to Hawaii.","4411":"Mr. McAuliffe and other Democrats tried to put the best face on the defeat, saying that Mr. Kerry was facing a difficult task in trying to unseat a sitting president during wartime. He argued that Mr. Bush was helped by the emergence last weekend of a videotape featuring Osama bin Laden addressing Americans, which reminded voters of the issue -- fear of terrorism -- that had always been central to Mr. Bush's campaign.","4412":"And so it went -- Republicans ran ads with wolves; Democrats countered with an ostrich. There was a brief moment last week when both men pledged not to politicize the Osama bin Laden tape. Then they both did exactly the opposite -- with Mr. Bush asserting the tape was a reminder that America could ill afford Kerryesque vacillation in the face of evil, and Mr. Kerry countering that the only reason Mr. bin Laden was making videotapes was that Mr. Bush had \"outsourced\" his capture to Afghan warlords.","4414":"As a result of that financial connection to Osama bin Laden, French and Swiss investigators have questioned him about possible financial links to Al Qaeda. He says he has none.","4415":"INTERNATIONAL A3-10 American Forces Prepare For Falluja Invasion American military forces surrounding Falluja, the western town at the heart of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, are preparing for what appears to be an imminent assault, while insurgents have set up a defensive perimeter around the city.

'It's unbelievable,' he said, 'the fact that I share my home with a partner is more threatening to people in America than Osama bin Laden.'","4418":"Those foundations of American support for Israel will almost certainly continue to outweigh any calculation of the costs, even with Osama bin Laden's attempt last month to justify his attacks by referring to the \"injustice and tyranny of the American-Israeli alliance against our people in Palestine.\"","4419":"Discussing the impact of the recent Osama bin Laden video just before the election, Neil Cavuto, an anchor on Fox News, said the Qaeda leader was in effect wearing a campaign button for Mr. Kerry. And in early October, Fox News reprimanded its chief political correspondent, Carl Cameron, for fabricating several quotes ostensibly uttered by Mr. Kerry -- many of them about a manicure -- in a mock article mistakenly posted, briefly, on the Fox News Web site.","442":"THEN, too, only economic engagement will transform the environment in which terrorists thrive, analysts say. Osama bin Laden and others prefer to live where people are poor and governments have failed, Afghanistan most notably. Military action may take out individual terrorists, but won't alter the conditions that help to produce them.","4420":"Michael Scheuer, the former chief of the C.I.A.'s Osama bin Laden unit and the author of a best-selling book critical of the administration's handling of the fight against terrorism, said in an interview with The New York Times this weekend that the government \"doesn't respect the threat\" because most officials still regard Al Qaeda as a terrorist organization that can be defeated by arresting or killing its operatives one at a time.","4421":"Yes, I think Osama bin Laden did hand President Bush the election, and Mr. Bush was able to capitalize on patriotic fervor and fear. But while Mr. Bush has made much of being a war president, that doesn't really drive Republicans. Their basic agenda is to make wealthy people wealthier. Probably they would just as soon gain their wealth without hurting others, but that reality doesn't stand in their way.","4422":"Mr. Kerry's aides said his efforts to turn the election to the economy were drowned out by news from Iraq as well as Mr. Bush's focus on cultural issues. The slide worsened as the final days of the campaign were dominated by two overseas topics, Osama bin Laden's videotaped message that was released on the weekend before the election and the missing explosives in Iraq.","4423":"Judge Robertson ruled against the government in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a former driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan who is facing terrorism charges. Mr. Hamdan's lawyers had asked the court to declare the military commission process fatally flawed.","4424":"By the end of October, a Wikipedia administrator from New Orleans decided to put both candidates' entries under protection until after the election: no one could edit a page on either candidate without the changes' being vetted on a discussion page. Thus Senator Kerry and President Bush took their places next to the other untouchables in the Wikipedia: Ariel Sharon, Osama bin Laden, Rush Limbaugh and Salvador Allende.","4425":"Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a former driver for Osama bin Laden who was taken captive in Afghanistan, was to be tried as a war criminal before the newly created military commission at Guant\u00e1namo. Under the legal regime set up by the Bush administration, these tribunals lack the procedural safeguards of a court-martial. Mr. Hamdan would have very little right to see the evidence presented against him, a situation that puts a defendant at a severe disadvantage.","4426":"Mr. Bush should quit fiddling around on the domestic side and revamp his war council and national security team. The Bushies can stop mentioning Osama's name and tell themselves that his last, less militant video was a sign of weakness, but it's just part of their dangerous denial. Osama bin Laden killed 3,000 innocents on 9/11; let's nail him.","4427":"Officially, all of this was dedicated to the general and the boost he gave to his city and nation. Broader themes -- how the Kalashnikov ran away from its creator to become a symbol not just of Russian success, but of crime, terror and jihad, how it is carried by Osama bin Laden and Shamil Basayev, Russia's most wanted man and the architect of the school siege in Beslan -- largely passed without comment.","443":"Osama bin Laden and the organization of a terror network. 18","4430":"In Baghdad, American and Iraqi forces arrested Sheik Mahdi al-Sumaydai, a prominent fundamentalist Sunni cleric, and more than a dozen of his followers after finding weapons in his sheik's mosque, officials said. Mr. Sumaydai was arrested by the Americans last winter and was released several months ago. His mosque is the largest religious sanctuary in the capital for devotees of the Salafiya branch of Sunni Islam, which Mr. Zarqawi and Osama bin Laden practice.","4431":"For a broader view of men in combat, there's Linda Robinson's Masters of Chaos: The Secret History of the Special Forces (PublicAffairs, $26.95), about the Army Special Forces. They aren't simply \"the primary Department of Defense tool for fighting the war on terror,\" they're the jazzmen of the military world, working without a score, improvising their way out of trouble. Robinson's book gives us an intimate, valuable history of the Special Forces' last two decades, and follows them through Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. She offers a white-knuckle sequence at Tora Bora, where the soldiers were never able to determine whether they were only one village away from Osama bin Laden. In Iraq she watches as American troops are welcomed as liberators, and reports that only in the postcombat phase \"did Iraqi gratitude begin to evaporate.\" As one of the few journalists ever embedded with the Special Forces, Robinson finds herself arguing for a surprising thing: a more sensitive war on terror. \"Many of the best solutions,\" she writes, \"are those which employ minimum force.\" hviktor koenAn entire culture is captured in one remark: 'Thank you for getting rid of Saddam. . . . But everybody wants America . . . to go.'","4432":"Nor have they shown that Ms. Stewart had any detailed knowledge of hundreds of telephone calls that Mr. Sattar, the paralegal, made from his home to Egyptian militants across the globe, including one man, Rifai Taha, who was working with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Transcripts of the calls, which were secretly recorded by the F.B.I, make up most of the prosecutors' evidence.","4433":"And it's not only the Iraqis who have an interest in Iraqi democracy, Feldman says. The United States and Europe have for too long erred both morally and strategically in supporting authoritarian governments in the Arab world. In Egypt, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, Islamist terrorists 'have long been motivated by their grievances against the authoritarian states in which they live.' Feldman points out that it was a 'cadre of Egyptian Islamist terrorists, defeated and thus displaced from their traditional battle against the Egyptian state in the 1990's,' who 'joined forces with Osama bin Laden to create Al Qaeda.' The answer to the threat of Islamic terrorism, he says, is to engage in nation-building 'aimed at creating democratically legitimate states that would treat their citizens with dignity and respect.'","4434":"Last year, when Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the charges in the case that is one of the country's largest terrorism financing prosecutions, he said the cleric, Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, had boasted that he had personally delivered $20 million to Osama bin Laden.","4435":"Fontaine's subject matter is nothing new. He laces into the Bush administration and its policies, but the raw, expletive-ridden vocabulary is vivid and the perspective is fresh. Fontaine's solution for capturing Osama bin Laden: \"Get child services on the case.\"","4437":"The Black Bear narrative, then, is partly about the many cases the now-troubled Mr. Alanssi helped make. His work included his participation in a classic undercover operation as he helped gather evidence against the Yemeni sheik, Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, who Attorney General John Ashcroft said had admitted providing financing for Osama bin Laden. Mr. Moayad's lawyer has fiercely denied the charges. A trial for the sheik and one of his assistants, who were extradited here from Germany months ago, is scheduled for January.","4438":"How important is taking Falluja? Huge. Falluja was to the Iraqi insurgency what Afghanistan was to Osama bin Laden. It was the safe haven where militants could, with total impunity, plan operations, stockpile weapons and connect the suicide bombers from abroad with their Iraqi handlers. That's gone. One arms cache alone found here had 49,000 pieces of ordnance, ranging from mortars to ammo rounds. Another arms cache blown up last week kept exploding for 45 minutes after it was hit, a senior U.S. officer said.","4439":"As the campaign heated up, the conservative radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham told Larry King of CNN that \"while this kumbaya moment that we're all sharing about party unity is wonderful, the truth of the matter is -- \" and then popped Senator Kerry for his blast at the president for outsourcing the hunt for Osama bin Laden. John Tierney of The Times, in his lively Political Points column, quoted Kerry's call for a \"more sensitive war on terror\" and awarded him the \"Kumbaya Prize.\"","444":"He also faces the prospect of a direct confrontation with the Taliban, who harbor the terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden and who today threatened 'a massive attack' by its Islamic warriors if Pakistan offers the United States any assistance.","4440":"Special Operations forces and paramilitary units of the intelligence agency already work together in some groups around the world, including those dedicated to the search for Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda. But only the intelligence agency paramilitary units, and not Special Operations forces, are authorized to conduct the most sensitive covert operations, under presidential directives known as findings. The examples have included the operations in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks, when paramilitary units were the first American forces sent there.","4441":"In a recent closed-door speech to a private group, George J. Tenet, the former director of central intelligence, described Mr. Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, as being \"at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden\" because of his role in providing nuclear technology to other countries. A tape recording of the speech was obtained by The New York Times.","4442":"An adherent of the Salafiya sect of Sunni Islam, a fundamentalist branch followed by Osama bin Laden and the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Mr. Janabi set up a strict Taliban-like regime in Falluja. He named himself head of the mujahedeen council and provided safe haven for foreigners like Mr. Zarqawi and anyone willing to take up arms against the Americans or the interim Iraqi government. He worked closely with a Falluja native believed to be Mr. Zarqawi's second in command, Omar Hadid.","4443":"When Mr. Stone's Alexander pursues his brown-skinned, doe-eyed foe, the Persian King Darius III, through the rocky desolation of northern Iran, what audience won't picture American forces stalking Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora? When Mr. Stone's Alexander vows, \"You'll run to the end of the earth, but you'll never run far enough,\" who won't hear President Bush boasting that bin Laden and Al Qaeda are \"on the run\"?","4444":"Sheik Moayad mentioned dying nobly for Islam. He described close ties to Osama bin Laden and Hamas. And, when asked whether contributions would go for arming and training mujahedeen fighters against Israel and the United States, \"the bigger Satan\" in Mr. Alanssi's words, the sheik's answer must have thrilled the F.B.I. agents listening nearby.","4445":"A great fear of the Americans is that the Iranian government will be able to exert influence here through Shiite government leaders, and that religious Sunni leaders will promote the Salafi sect, a fundamentalist branch of Sunni Islam that counts Osama bin Laden and the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi among its followers.","4446":"There have been months of heavy fighting in South Waziristan, one of seven isolated tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, where American officials believe Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda may be hiding. Pakistani military officials said that while checkpoints would be abandoned, several thousand troops would remain on the main military base in Wana. Pakistani officials say they have killed hundreds of foreign militants since March, but militants have killed at least 202 Pakistani government soldiers and wounded 467.","4447":"The broadcast followed the channel's airing last month of a videotape by Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, in which he warned of new Sept. 11-style attacks.","4448":"\"Why don't you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or to the White House and engage in talks, ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace?\" Mr. Putin was quoted as telling a group of Western visitors.","4449":"In the last 15 years of his life Mr. Paschke reworked his layers and voids of color into portraits of George Washington, Adolf Hitler, Elvis Presley, Abraham Lincoln and Osama bin Laden. Mr. Paschke's work is in the collections of major museums in the United States and abroad. He had his first solo show at the Deson-Zaks Gallery in Chicago in 1970 and his first New York show at Hundred Acres in SoHo in 1971. From 1977 to 1996 he exhibited regularly with the Phyllis Kind Gallery, in both Chicago and New York. The first retrospective of his work was at the Pompidou Center in 1989. His most recent exhibitions were in September and October at the Maya Polsky Gallery in Chicago and the Galerie Darthea Speyer in Paris.","445":"HIJACKERS HAD BEEN SOUGHT -- Two of the hijackers had been known as associates of Osama bin Laden and were being sought by investigators in the United States.

And in the eyes of many believers, his worldly dictatorship in Iran undermined his stature as a religious figure, since mullahs are not supposed to act like politicians. Osama bin Laden is an amateur priest with more knowledge of Swiss bank transfers and media manipulation than of the intricacies of Islam. It would be hard to find a serious Muslim cleric or scholar who respects him.","4456":"THEMES: Act I: Making fun of celebrities.

Ben Langlands and Nickki Bell created a digital model of a deserted crumbling bunker called \"The House of Osama bin Laden,\" which visitors could tour by video screen. Kutlug Ataman, a Turkish native who has lived in London, screened simultaneous filmed interviews with Turks who say they have been reincarnated and an investigation of a horticulturist's obsession.","446":"Mr. Rabbani today called Mr. Massoud a 'national hero' and claimed, without citing evidence, that the assassination was a 'conspiracy involving Pakistan, the terrorist group of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.' It occurred two days before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","4460":"I'm afraid that my campaign to assist Mr. Bush in raising troops is, so far, proving no more successful than my past missions to help Mr. Bush find W.M.D. in Iraq or Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. No wonder Mr. Bush never calls, never writes.","4461":"In November, 26 prominent Saudi clerics signed a petition supporting the \"defensive jihad\" in Iraq. Although their statement ruled out attacking relief workers or other uninvolved parties, it was interpreted as a signal for Saudis to volunteer. Osama bin Laden and his followers emerged from a similar call 25 years ago to fight in Afghanistan, a fight that they subsequently spread around the globe.","4462":"The first is the hunt for Taliban and Qaeda leaders, like Osama bin Laden, which has turned up no new leads recently, military officials said. 'If anyone knew where that fellow was, they'd sure go get him,' Mr. Rumsfeld said on Tuesday after meeting with Special Operations forces at Bagram.","4464":"Fonte paints a vivid word-portrait of a stateless, unelected class of \"transnational progressives\" who are quietly undermining democracy in the name of human rights (as they define them). Ultimately, he envisions the United States as locked in a two-front war both with post-democrats and with reactionary \"pre-democrats\" like Osama bin Laden, although he clearly finds left-leaning international lawyers more insidious and, over the long term, more dangerous.","4465":"Ms. Scheiner, 24, who was reared as Esty Levy in Crown Heights, was set to be married on Sept. 11, 2001. After the terrorist attack that day, she and Dovi, her fianc\u00e9, struggled with the wrenching decision of whether to proceed with the wedding. After consulting with a rabbi, they went ahead. \"The rabbi said, 'Look at it as Osama bin Laden did something evil, and you are doing something small but good,\"' Ms. Scheiner said.","4466":"Hunting for Osama bin Laden, the C.I.A. established a series of small, covert bases in the rugged mountain frontier of northwest Pakistan in late 2003.

Critics of the proposals say such deceptive missions could shatter the Pentagon's credibility. A1 The Stalled Hunt for Bin Laden The hunt for Osama bin Laden has been strictly supervised by Pakistani officials. The search remains stalled, frustrated by the remote topography, stymied by the Qaeda network, sidetracked by the war in Iraq, and limited by deep hostility.

They're dissuading protesters from coming out by creating a climate of fear.' The speaker was Brian Becker, a national coordinator for the Answer Coalition, an antiwar and antiracism group -- not Mr. McDonald.","4474":"CAIRO, Dec. 16 - In an audiotape posted Thursday on an Islamist Web site, Osama bin Laden appeared to turn his attention to his Saudi homeland, accusing the ruling al-Saud dynasty of being the \"agents of infidels\" and applauding an attack last week against the United States Consulate in Jidda.","4475":"There's not much happiness in Dan Fesperman's timely page-turner, THE WARLORD'S SON (Knopf, $23), which begins in Pakistan during the weeks following Sept. 11, 2001. Najeeb, the title character, is a young Pakistani translator, educated in the United States and banished from the tribal lands by his powerful father. Working with Skelly, a middle-aged American reporter on the trail of Osama bin Laden, Najeeb helps his new boss cross into Afghanistan, where they're quickly surrounded by a treacherous mix of spies and fanatics, not to mention Najeeb's hard-to-read relatives. \"Foreign news is finally a growth industry again,\" crows Skelly, who's willing to risk everything for one last scoop.","4477":"In his enthusiasm, Mr. Sattar was less than prudent about who was on the other end of the line. One frequent caller, Rifai Taha, was an Islamic Group military leader who had been an associate of Osama bin Laden's since at least 1998 and was in Afghanistan, probably with Al Qaeda, at the time of many calls. Mr. Taha was advocating an end to a cease-fire that the Islamic Group had observed since 1997.","4478":"LONDON - WHAT does Osama bin Laden want?","448":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 15\u2014 Two of the men believed to have hijacked the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on Tuesday were known to the authorities as associates of Osama bin Laden and had been sought in the United States since August by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, law enforcement and intelligence officials said today.","4480":"The last time Mr. Rumsfeld tried to force himself into the intelligence collection and analysis business, he created a boutique C.I.A. in the bowels of the Pentagon under the command of Douglas Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy. The office essentially fabricated a link between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden -- a link used to justify the Iraq invasion, and one that Mr. Rumsfeld was not getting from the C.I.A.","4481":"The Shiite leaders' statements were echoed by Dr. Allawi. Although he is a Shiite, he has based his own election campaign on a slate of secular Shiite and Sunni candidates that appears poised to be one of the stronger rivals to a powerful alliance of Shiite religious parties that many Iraqis regard as the early favorite in the elections. Dr. Allawi said it was clear that the insurgents wanted the attacks \"to create ethnic and religious tensions, problems and conflicts,\" on a pattern that he said fitted closely with videotaped exhortations to Iraq's insurgents from Al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","4482":"In May 2001, in Federal District Court in New York, four men were convicted of conspiring with Osama bin Laden to bomb the two embassies.","4483":"General Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999, has enraged Islamic hard-liners, including some in the Pakistani establishment, with his support of the United States-led campaign against terrorism.

How hard can it be to find a 6-foot-8 Arab with a kidney problem? Just find the camel with a dialysis machine, and follow it!\"","4486":"Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, went to Pakistan soon after the Sept. 11 attacks and raised concerns about Dr. Khan, some of whose scientists were said to have met with Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader. But Mr. Hadley did not ask General Musharraf to take action, according to a senior administration official. He returned to Washington complaining that it was unclear whether the Khan Laboratories were operating with the complicity of the Pakistani military, or were controlled by freelancers, motivated by visions of profit or of spreading the bomb to Islamic nations. The Pakistanis insisted they had no evidence of any proliferation at all, a claim American officials said they found laughable.","4487":"The quest begins in Liverpool, where the author is given a Beatles tour by a taxi driver who says that John Lennon was best man at his wedding. The fact that Queenan almost believes this gent suggests he has the willingness to be pleasantly duped that is an essential ingredient of advanced Anglophilia. From this implausibility it is a mere hop to a defiantly unfair assault on London theater (Andrew Lloyd Webber is a more baleful influence on the world than Osama bin Laden) and a prolonged moan about the capital itself, which inconveniences the foreign visitor by giving him too much to see. \"The tourist is hapless, cowed, puny and ultimately penniless,\" Queenan grumbles contentedly. Before you have time to object that he has failed to visit the National, which ranks among the greatest theaters on earth, our guide is down in Somerset taking a blowtorch to Glastonbury, England's Hippie Central. This is the kind of town, he writes, \"where you feel solidarity with the acne-plagued skateboarders.\"","4488":"\"We can't find Osama bin Laden, but Martha Stewart is in jail,\" Mr. Clark said in what eventually became his routine set. \"I know I sleep better. How hard can it be to find a 6-foot-8 Arab with a kidney problem?

William Boykin, a deputy under secretary of defense who has already demonstrated that he should not be allowed anywhere near the most serious matters of national security. General Boykin, who once had the job of directing the hunt for Osama bin Laden, is an evangelical Christian who believes God put President Bush in the White House. He has described the fight against Islamic militants as a struggle against Satan and declared that it can be won only \"if we come at them in the name of Jesus.\"","449":"That threat comes mostly from Afghanistan and the ruling Taliban, the same group that is suspected of having sheltered Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the terrorist attacks this week.","4490":"CAIRO, Dec. 27 - An audiotape message said to be made by the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden called for Muslims to boycott elections there next month and endorsed the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as Mr. bin Laden's deputy in Iraq.","4491":"CRAWFORD, Tex., Dec. 29 - President Bush took the unusual step on Wednesday of responding to one of Osama bin Laden's taunting tape recordings, declaring that Mr. bin Laden's recent call for Iraqis to boycott the elections in January \"make the stakes of this pretty clear to me.\"","4492":"In a tape-recorded message 10 days later, Osama bin Laden praised the Jidda attack and threatened attacks against Saudi oil facilities.","4493":"An article on Oct. 30 about a videotaped message from Osama bin Laden in which he told the United States that it could avoid a repetition of the 9/11 attacks if it stopped threatening Muslims' security referred incorrectly to material being read in a Florida classroom where President Bush was visiting when he learned of the attacks.

Rather, the law is intended to help keep the weapon out of the hands of 'terrorists, general nut cases and survivalists,' Mr. Koretz said, citing government reports suggesting that it had been used in assassinations overseas and that at least 25 had been bought by Osama bin Laden.","4507":"Djamel Beghal, a 39-year-old Algerian-born French citizen who is suspected of being one of Osama bin Laden's most important operatives in Europe, resisted demands by the chief judge, Philippe Vandingenen, to state an affiliation with a particular Muslim political movement.","4508":"A defense lawyer in the trial of Lynne F.

The Web site encouraged supporters to send money to a bank in Pakistan, providing account numbers. And it urged believers to join the movement and apply their skills in 'training camps, refugee camps and battlefronts.'","4510":"Mr. Knox said the tapes showed that even before meetings with the informers, the sheik and Mr. Zayed were recorded speaking to each other about topics like the sheik's ties to Osama bin Laden and the need to use code in discussing such topics.","4511":"Kabul, Afghanistan - AROUND the Islamic world it is common currency that Muslims are perpetual victims of Western and Zionist conspiracies. The bill of particulars includes the handling of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Israel's inequitable treatment of the Palestinians, and the deaths of thousands of civilians in Iraq -- as a result first of United Nations sanctions after the Persian Gulf war, and more recently of the American occupation. The most articulate spokesman of such views is, of course, Osama bin Laden.","4512":"The three men, the American military said, belong to the Mosul branch of the group led by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who has pledged loyalty to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.

It should. The week before, the Muslim militant group Ansar al-Sunna in Iraq called for all Iraqi Muslims to boycott Iraq's voting booths, decrying them as \"centers of atheism,\" and added the warning that \"the Mujahedeen will be attacking polling stations.\" Hamas and Islamic Jihad are boycotting today's Palestinian election, just as the main Sunni political movement in Iraq, the Iraqi Islamic Party, has vowed to do there.

It was there that the two men met Osama bin Laden, who enlisted them for the Sept. 11 mission.","4516":"The invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a hunt for Osama bin Laden, with development money and a dash of democracy added because the Taliban had to be toppled.","4517":"Osama bin Laden has been an obvious focus of the press for so long that it is strange that his basic biography remains so blurry. Network news programs have depicted an elusive, faraway bogeyman with a deadly reach, but his might seems rather meager, when seen up close.","4518":"There are no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Osama bin Laden is still running free.","4519":"Last month, a message on an audiotape believed to be from Osama bin Laden endorsed Mr. Zarqawi as his deputy in Iraq.","452":"There is evidence that true terrorists are more circumspect. According to security experts, Osama bin Laden and his followers do not trust the Internet, and pass the most important messages face to face.","4520":"In his own battery of interviews leading up to next week's celebration, President Bush said he regretted two hallmark phrases of his first term: daring terrorists to \"bring 'em on\" and promising to capture Osama bin Laden \"dead or alive.\" And he credited his wife with helping point out his ill-chosen words.","4521":"At the White House meeting last week, one senior military official warned that Iraq was already emerging as \"Afghanistan West,\" becoming a magnet and haven for militants, as Afghanistan did for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda under the Taliban.","4522":"Asked to name the most important problem facing the country, just 3 percent named Social Security, while 11 percent named Iraq and Osama bin Laden, and 10 percent identified \"war\" and the economy.","4524":"Nearly two years ago, Attorney General John Ashcroft personally announced to Congress that federal prosecutors had filed terrorism-financing charges against a Yemeni sheik and his aide. Law enforcement officials indicated that the sheik, Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, had used a Brooklyn mosque to help funnel millions of dollars to Al Qaeda and had boasted that he had personally delivered $20 million to Osama bin Laden.","4525":"The Americans are offering a $25 million reward for the capture or killing of Mr. Zarqawi, a Jordanian who has pledged his loyalty to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Zarqawi's group, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, formerly known as One God and Jihad, is believed to be responsible for the deaths of hundreds here in ambushes, bombings and beheadings. An American military spokeswoman and a British security company said Thursday that a Briton and an Iraqi security guard were killed Wednesday in a roadside ambush north of Baghdad and that a Brazilian man working for one of South America's largest construction companies was kidnapped.","4526":"In short, there were plenty of reasons for Mr. Bush to avoid mentioning Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and \"the axis of evil\" by name. The news in Iraq is hardly good enough to brag about, and relations with Iran and North Korea remain tense and seemingly stalemated. Mr. Bush referred only to unnamed enemies who \"have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve.\"","4527":"The administration's notion of freedom has been especially convenient, and its promotion of it especially cynical. In the first place, there is no evidence to support, and no good reason to believe, that Al Qaeda's attack on America was primarily motivated by a hatred of freedom. Osama bin Laden is clearly no lover of freedom, but this is an irrelevance. The attack on America was motivated by religious and cultural fanaticism.","4528":"Both girls I interviewed wore veils and one also wore a full Afghan-like head-to-toe covering; one was of Egyptian parents, the other of Tunisian parents, but both were born and raised in France. What did I learn from them? That they got all their news from Al Jazeera TV, because they did not believe French TV, that the person they admired most in the world was Osama bin Laden, because he was defending Islam, that suicide \"martyrdom\" was justified because there was no greater glory than dying in defense of Islam, that they saw themselves as Muslims first and French citizens last, and that all their friends felt pretty much the same.","4529":"The commandos here this week were the same type of Special Operations forces who are hunting top insurgents in Iraq and Osama bin Laden in the mountainous wilds of Afghanistan and Pakistan. But under the top-secret military plan, they are also conducting counterterrorism missions in support of civilian agencies in the United States.","453":"Osama bin Laden operates training camps and has a worldwide network of followers who execute his murderous plans. All this takes large sums of money, which he inherited from his wealthy family. You report that much of it, now frozen, is in United States and allied banks.","4530":"Interrogators themselves are not above such hairsplitting. After an intense discussion about how humane it would be to deprive prisoners of sleep, and just how much sleep deprivation constituted cruelty, Mackey came to the conclusion that \"if the interrogator followed the exact same regime -- slept, ate . . . and took breaks on the same schedule as the prisoner -- there was no way to argue\" that such treatment was cruel. There is even a name for an interrogator staying with a prisoner until one or the other of them breaks: it's called \"monstering.\" Double-teaming a prisoner, in which different interrogators take turns sleeping, was considered immoral, Mackey says. Because monstering was so hard for an interrogator to endure, it was used only when something important was at stake and the prisoner seemed close to breaking. One interrogator kept a prisoner in a booth for 29 straight hours. It was worth it, Mackey reports: the prisoner had been a translator for Osama bin Laden and disclosed a Qaeda plot to use the chemical agent ricin.","4531":"It has found a corresponding position at the bottom of Bangladeshi politics as well, in the social scrum that produces figures like Bangla Bhai. (Opposition politicians have linked Bangla Bhai to Jamaat-e-Islami, a tie that Jamaat and Bangla Bhai have both denied.) The border provinces have, since independence, harbored a proliferation of armed groups that either Bangladesh, India, Myanmar or Pakistan, or some region or faction in one of those countries, has been willing to support for its own political reasons. By the early 1990's Islamist groups began appearing, mainly at the periphery of the jihad centered on Afghanistan. The most important of these has been the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji), which has been associated with Fazlul Rahman, who signed Osama bin Laden's famous declaration in 1998 endorsing international, coordinated jihad -- the document that introduced Al Qaeda to the larger world. But Bangla Bhai's group and others have since emerged and are making their bids for power.","4532":"Doubleday will publish a collection of the translated writings of Al Qaeda leaders next year and will donate profits from the book to charities that are aiding American victims of terrorism. The book, tentatively titled 'The Al Qaeda Reader,' will consist of writings by Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's second in command, plus material attributed to Osama bin Laden. The material was discovered in the Library of Congress by Raymond Ibrahim, a Library of Congress specialist in Middle Eastern studies, who will translate the text. Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House Inc., Doubleday's parent, said the company had not yet determined which charities would receive profits from the book. Doubleday considers its use of the material to be 'fair use' and therefore will not pay royalties, although it will make payments to the translator for the right to publish his work.

In the late 1990's he bought a coffee shop, the Alexandria, on Haldon Street, a polyglot immigrant bazaar in Lakemba, a Sydney suburb. But in March 2000 he headed to Pakistan, telling friends he wanted to raise his family in an Islamic country. He returned home sporting an Osama bin Laden T-shirt, said Ibrahim Fraser, who often talked with Mr. Habib at the Alexandria. And a year later, Mr. Habib sold his coffee shop and set out again, telling his wife and friends he was looking for a religious school for his children.","4536":"Among the broadcasts criticized by the United States were repeated showings of taped messages by Osama bin Laden, and, more specifically, the reporting early last year, before Al Jazeera was kicked out of Iraq, of the journalist Ahmed Mansour, that emphasized civilian casualties during an assault on Falluja. The network also reports passionately about the Palestinian conflict.","4537":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 - Senator John Kerry said on Sunday that the attacks of Sept. 11 were the \"central deciding thing\" in his contest with President Bush and that the release of an Osama bin Laden videotape the weekend before Election Day had effectively erased any hope he had of victory.","4538":"INTERNATIONAL A3-16 Iraqis Defy Insurgents And Vote in Large Numbers Defying death threats, mortars and suicide bombers, Iraqis turned out in great numbers to vote in the country's first free election in 50 years, offering a resounding, if uneven, endorsement of democratic rule 22 months after Saddam Hussein was swept from power. A1 By increasing American troop strength in Iraq, banning all civilian car traffic and ordering a host of other security measures -- some within military doctrine and others distinctly not -- American and Iraqi forces widely thwarted insurgents who had threatened to wash the streets with blood.

A21 Kerry Reflects on Bush's Win The attacks of Sept. 11 were central in deciding the presidential election, Senator John Kerry said on NBC's 'Meet the Press.'

Without citing evidence, he claimed the assassination had been a 'conspiracy involving Pakistan, the terrorist group of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.'","4540":"Unocal also had its share of controversies over its operations in Asia. In 1998, the company shelved plans to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, then under the control of the Taliban, after United States aircraft bombed Afghan targets, seeking terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden.","4541":"The sheik spoke in Arabic, but according to a prosecution translation that is to be read aloud in court this morning, he boasted of his close ties to Hamas and to Osama bin Laden. The sheik, Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, said he had once been Mr. bin Laden's teacher of Islamic laws.","4542":"A few weeks ago it was reported that the Bush administration was considering doubling the reward for the capture of Osama bin Laden from $25 million to $50 million. I totally agree with readjusting the reward for bin Laden's capture, I just think the Bush team has the number totally wrong.","4543":"It would be nice if the extremes of the American right and left showed some of the same measured ability to argue against mistaken American policies without impugning the integrity of the other side; but perhaps this is asking too much of ideologues caught up in the past. David Horowitz is one such relic of traditional left-right struggles (and like many of the toughest grapplers, he has been on both sides). In \"Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left,\" this leftist-turned-conservative provocateur aims to discredit his old allies by arguing that the left is in bed with Osama bin Laden because of their shared anti-Americanism. He writes that \"self-described progressives\" have formed \"inexplicable alliances . . . with Arab fascists and Islamic fanatics in their war against America and the West.\"","4544":"Under extreme duress at Guant\u00e1namo, including hundreds of hours of interrogation and long periods of isolation, the three men confessed to having been in a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. They also said they were among a number of men who could be seen in a videotape of Osama bin Laden.

Moreover, his father was said to have been a close associate of Osama bin Laden.","4549":"The government shut down the relief agency in October, saying it gave money to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","455":"In Hamburg itself, a city of 1.7 million with some 80,000 Muslims, there are about 2,450 extremist foreigners, only 270 identified in the report as Iranian or Arab. According to the report, the Palestinian group Hamas does significant fund-raising here, and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization has individual members, relying 'on personal contacts and a global network structure.' On Dec. 26 last year, the German police announced a blow against Mr. bin Laden, arresting four men in Frankfurt on terrorism charges and seizing an arsenal of rifles, handguns, machine guns, homemade detonators, a grenade, false documents and a quantity of potassium permanganate for potential bomb-making. The police, who passed on information to Britain and France that later led to further arrests in London, said the men had received training in Mr. bin Laden's camps.","4550":"INTERNATIONAL A3-12 First Nationwide Elections Take Place in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is embarking on its first nationwide elections. Until now, the country's authoritarian founding dynasty, the Al-Sauds, have not shared power. So the entry of elected public figures into the government introduces an unpredictable element into the equation of how this desert kingdom is ruled. A1 A Secular Leader Among Shiites Iraqis and the Bush administration are wondering whether the secular vision of Adil Abdul Mahdi, one of the leading candidates for Iraqi prime minister and one of the leaders of the United Iraqi Alliance, extends to the rest of the Shiite alliance, or whether it is a facade covering a more ambitious religious agenda.

Another will be Barzan al-Tikriti, a half brother of Mr. Hussein's. Mr. Hussein will not go on trial until the cases against his associates have been completed.

Yet no one put together the reports on suicide airplane hijackings and a desire by Osama bin Laden to hit the United States?","4554":"We must question the intentions of those who were ultimately responsible for making decisions related to Osama bin Laden yet who seemed to ignore the many warning signs.","4555":"Add to the painful postmortems of 9/11 this week's disclosure that federal aviation officials were more lulled than alarmed by a steady stream of intelligence warnings about Osama bin Laden in the months before the terrorist attacks. As with numerous other intelligence failures uncovered by the Sept. 11 commission, the warnings -- dozens of them -- were not deemed specific enough to provide adequate defenses at the nation's airports, according to Federal Aviation Administration officials. In 105 intelligence reports received during the five months preceding the attacks, Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda were mentioned 52 times, according to the commission, which faulted the F.A.A. for not doing enough to heighten security.","4556":"The 13-page proposal presented to Dr. Rice by her top counterterrorism adviser, Richard A. Clarke, laid out ways to step up the fight against Al Qaeda, focusing on Osama bin Laden's headquarters in Afghanistan. The ideas included giving 'massive support' to anti-Taliban groups 'to keep Islamic extremist fighters tied down'; destroying terrorist training camps 'while classes are in session' and then sending in teams to gather intelligence on terrorist cells; deploying armed drone aircraft against known terrorists; more aggressively tracking Qaeda money; and accelerating the F.B.I.'s translation and analysis of material from surveillance of terrorism suspects in American cities.","4557":"He calls Osama bin Laden \"a modern Robin Hood,\" and the World Trade Center attacks \"a poetic act,\" \"a pure abstraction.\" His 23-year-old son is in jail in Turkey on charges that he was involved in the bombings there that killed 61 people in November 2003.","4558":"The Al Qaeda terrorist organization led by Osama bin Laden has stitched together a network of terrorist cells and groups to wage jihad. Al Qaeda seeks to drive the United States out of the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere in the Muslim world. It also seeks to overthrow moderate governments and establish theocracies similar to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The Al Qaeda network is well financed, has trained tens of thousands of jihadists, and has a cell structure in over 40 nations. It also is actively seeking to develop and acquire weapons of mass destruction.","4559":"That decision has been costly to the prosecution's case. Without Mr. Alanssi, the prosecutors were unable to introduce evidence that they had described as crucial. The jury has yet to hear, for example, a claim based on Mr. Alanssi's account that Sheik Moayad boasted that he gave Osama bin Laden $20 million.","456":"Speaking on the NBC program 'Meet the Press,' Mr. Cheney echoed other senior officials in declaring that nations harboring terrorists like Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in last week's attacks, would face 'the full wrath of the United States.'","4560":"She said she was disappointed that the two or three jurors who, based on notes from the jury room, appeared to be leaning toward acquitting her did not stick to their position. She attributed the jury's harsh judgment to the fear that she said has permeated the country since the Sept. 11 attacks. An early decision by Judge Koeltl to allow prosecutors to show videotapes of Osama bin Laden in the courtroom had been a crucial setback to her defense, she said.","4561":"Speaking publicly for the first time since he was freed two weeks ago, Mr. Habib, a 49-year-old Australian citizen born in Egypt, also described psychological abuse that seemed intended to undermine his identity -- as a husband, a father and a Muslim man. At Guant\u00e1namo, he said, he was sexually humiliated by a female interrogator who reached under her skirt and threw what appeared to be blood in his face. He also said he was forced to look at photographs of his wife's face superimposed on images of naked women next to Osama bin Laden.","4562":"The United States government shut the Islamic African Relief Agency in October, accusing it of having supplied money to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the A.P. reported. The government shut down the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development in 2001, saying that it had raised money for Hamas, according to The A.P.","4563":"Bamba is depicted many times, punctuating a pantheon of global personalities ranging from Che Guevara and Bob Marley to a demonic Osama bin Laden and a dapper President George W. Bush flanked by Senegalese soldiers who fought with American troops in the gulf war.","4565":"His name is Mohamed Alanssi, the government informer who set up a sting that snared a Yemeni sheik who was once, prosecutors claim, Osama bin Laden's spiritual adviser. He was to be the prosecution's star witness, until he set himself on fire outside the White House in November, protesting his handling by the government.","4566":"American-led forces overthrew the Taliban for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.","4567":"'Terrorism' was not an element of any of the offenses with which Ms. Stewart was charged, and Osama bin Laden was not part of any of the charges; yet the prosecution was permitted to bring Mr. bin Laden's name into the trial.","4568":"NUCLEAR MATERIALS -- A nuclear attack in an American city is the ultimate nightmare. The desire, on the part of the terrorists, is there: Osama bin Laden has declared acquisition of nuclear weapons to be a religious duty. Fortunately, there are considerable logistical and technological hurdles to terrorists' setting off a nuclear device. But it is far from impossible, and a so-called dirty bomb, which disperses radioactive material without a nuclear explosion, could be less of a challenge to make. The key to prevention is identifying and securing nuclear weapons and materials, especially in the former Soviet Union.","4569":"\"We fear Iraq will have a sectarian war,\" the sheik began to tell me, only to be interrupted by his 3-year-old son running to embrace his father. I was told the boy's name was Osama. \"I named him after Osama bin Laden,\" the sheik said, smiling. \"Bin Laden is a good man.\"","457":"The administration, however, is preparing a powerful military strike if the Taliban, as expected, refuse to hand over the terrorist Osama bin Laden and shut down his terrorist network.","4570":"It was Mr. Zarqawi who, in a letter captured by Kurdish forces last year, called on his followers to launch sectarian attacks against Iraqi Shiites in hopes of provoking an all-out civil war. Mr. Zarqawi's group is believed responsible for a wave of bombings at Ashura last year that killed more than 170 people. In the months since then, Mr. Zarqawi has pledged his allegiance to Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda.","4571":"The defense lawyers worked to persuade the jury to discard as unbelievable his assertion that Sheik Moayad claimed close ties to Osama bin Laden and said he had given him $20 million before the Sept. 11 attack.","4572":"\"It was an important statement,\" said Matthew Bunn, a Harvard nuclear specialist who worked with Mr. Kerry's campaign last year, \"because they put both presidents' names on a document that said this has to be taken seriously. And that is important because Russian security officials have been acting as if protecting a few more secrets from the U.S. is more important than protecting nuclear materials from falling into the hands of Osama bin Laden.\"","4573":"But the loss was accompanied by what Iraq's interim government said was a breakthrough in the hunt for the terrorist group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian named by Osama bin Laden late last year as Al Qaeda's chief representative in Iraq. An announcement said American and Iraqi forces had seized two aides of Mr. Zarqawi last Sunday during a raid in Anah, a town on the Euphrates River about 200 miles northwest of Baghdad, close to the Syrian border. Anah lies on a stretch of the river where the First Marine Division began an offensive on Sunday that it described as aimed at \"criminals and terrorists who have attempted to destabilize Anbar Province.\"","4574":"But experts say the mosque has encouraged its members to participate in American society and politics. And though its leaders adhere to Wahabism, the strict sect of Islam embraced by Osama bin Laden and most other Saudis, it has also called on its members to shun violence.","4575":"Nobody had seen him; everybody had heard his name. \"In the Pol Pot time,\" people would say, and the story that followed was always horrendous. A woman I loved told me how she'd had to watch her family's heads smashed in one by one; if she had wept, she would have been next. She blamed Pol Pot. A number of Cambodian slum dwellers and Thai dealers in illegally logged hardwood admired him; most abhorred him. His brother, Loth Suong, told me that Pol Pot had been a kindly child. He didn't consider himself Pol Pot's relative anymore. Until recently, nobody even agreed about whether he was still alive. (He died once and for all in 1998, at 73.) One might call him the Osama bin Laden of his epoch; but he was more invisible to our knowledge than that other bugbear. In David P. Chandler's excellent biography, \"Brother Number One\" (1992), there is an eerie photograph of Pol Pot applauding and smiling in a crowd. What do we know about him, except that he smiles? Oh, that smile of his! Short quotes his henchman, Ieng Sary: \"His face was always smooth. . . . Many people misunderstood that -- he would smile his unruffled smile, and then they would be taken away and executed.\"","4576":"In recent days American and Iraqi officials have rounded up dozens of other people suspected of being militants, including two men arrested last week whom they described as aides to the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was identified last year by Osama bin Laden as Al Qaeda's chief representative in Iraq.","4577":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 - Osama bin Laden recently asked the Jordanian militant Musab al-Zarqawi to consider planning attacks outside Iraq and possibly on American soil, a United States intelligence official said Monday.","4578":"They believe that Osama bin Laden and his ilk created an important opening, with the royal family now casting about for ways to limit the Wahhabi extremism that it has encouraged but which now seeks to overthrow Saudi rule.","4579":"Over repeated objections from the defense yesterday, a federal judge at the terror financing trial of a Yemeni sheik permitted a witness to describe his time at a desolate Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and visits there by Osama bin Laden.","458":"Pakistan will send high-ranking military officers to Afghanistan today to demand that the Taliban government arrest Osama bin Laden and his top associates and hand them over to the United States. A1","4580":"Mr. Bush also said it was only 'a matter of time' before the United States located and captured Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's deputy leader, and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian who heads a militant network that has claimed responsibility for recent bombings, kidnappings and beheadings in Iraq.","4581":"Defense lawyers called the case in Brooklyn federal court a test of the American justice system, because, they said, prosecutors have used inflammatory references to the Sept. 11 attack and images of Osama bin Laden.","4582":"The Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose network claimed responsibility for the Hilla bombing and a second bombing in Baghdad on Wednesday, has begun an online publication to urge Muslims to fight Americans and their allies, Reuters reported Thursday. Mr. Zarqawi was designated by Osama bin Laden last year as Al Qaeda's chief representative in Iraq.","4583":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 3 - For more than two years, the Bush administration pressed the Indonesian government to prosecute a radical Islamic cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, whom the Americans portrayed as Osama bin Laden's lieutenant in Southeast Asia.","4584":"The most wanted man in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant, has begun to circulate a magazine on the Internet aimed at inspiring attacks against the Americans. The magazine has photos of President Bush and Osama bin Laden and includes text from Mr. bin Laden praising Mr. Zarqawi's fighters. Mr. Zarqawi's group, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, claimed responsibility in an Internet posting on Friday for two suicide car bombings that killed five policemen on Thursday at the Interior Ministry.","4585":"I didn't write 'Unholy Alliance' to 'discredit' my 'old allies by arguing that the left is in bed with Osama bin Laden because of their shared anti-Americanism,' as Noah Feldman falsely claims in his review (Chronicle: Political Islam, Feb. 6). Why would I, since my old allies discredited themselves long ago by having been in bed with Lenin and Castro and Ho? Unlike Islamic radicals, these totalitarians at least gave lip service to the goal of 'social justice.' In contrast, as the first third of my text makes clear, I wrote 'Unholy Alliance' to explain why the American left has made 'alliances of convenience with Islamic radicals who have declared war on the democratic West and whose own values are reactionary and oppressive.' James Woolsey, former director of central intelligence, found 'Unholy Alliance' a 'superb' book, and it has been praised as 'original' work by Victor Davis Hanson and other experts on radicalism and Islam who took the time to understand its argument, as Feldman obviously did not. David Horowitz Los Angeles","4586":"KABUL, Afghanistan, March 6 - Pakistani forces have begun operations on the border with Afghanistan, continuing their pursuit of foreign members of Al Qaeda into the mountainous tribal area where Osama bin Laden has been thought to be hiding for the last year, Pakistani and American military officials said late last week.","4587":"INTERNATIONAL A3-12 Decision Early in Iraq Left Troops Without Armor The Pentagon has maintained that it has moved steadfastly to protect all its troops in Iraq, but an examination of the procurement of bulletproof vests and the Army's other most critical equipment shows a stark gap between a supply problem seen as an emergency on the ground in Iraq but treated as a routine procurement issue back in Washington.

Lieberman, a Democrat, has angered some in his party for expressing willingness to work with President Bush to change Social Security -- in addition to supporting the war in Iraq and Mr. Bush's cabinet choices -- prompting some Democrats in Connecticut, his home state, to begin talking about a 'Dump Joe' effort. A13 Parties Prepare for Rules Fight Republicans and Democrats are preparing intently behind the scenes in anticipation of a Senate floor showdown over President Bush's judicial candidates. Members of both parties are combing precedents for a prospective move by Republicans to change rules so that Democrats cannot block votes on federal court nominees. A14 Mayor Struggles in Re-Election Several political strategists say James K.

There is also a photograph of Abu Anas al-Shami, a former leader in the Zarqawi group who was killed by an American missile in September, and a written tribute to him inside. Like other Qaeda-linked Web publications, the new magazine is partly a reaction against the Arab state media, which often misrepresent terrorist attacks, said Michael Doran, a professor of Near East Studies at Princeton University who monitors traffic on Islamist Web sites and chat rooms.","4592":"On \"T\u00e9kitoi,\" he remains an equal-opportunity offender. The album veers from plaints and laments to enraged polemics, in songs that tackle questions of identity, democracy, the root causes of violence, the persistence of idealism in a broken world and the gulf of understanding between Arab nations and the West. That's the subject of the propulsive title track, a duet with Christian Olivier of the Paris band Les T\u00eates Raides, which pits an Arab against a Westerner in a furious existential dialogue. (\"T\u00e9kitoi\" is a slang contraction of the French phrase \"T'es qui, toi?,\" or \"Who are you?\") It's a song that puts Mr. Taha in mind of those archetypal combatants, Osama bin Laden and George W. Bush.","4593":"The question of how well the government is protecting airline travelers surfaced again last month after the disclosure in a Sept. 11 commission investigation that in the months leading up to the attack, federal officials received 52 warnings about Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, some warning specifically about hijackings and suicide operations.","4594":"During the presidential campaign, the agency set off a political storm by permitting publication of \"Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror,\" by Mr. Scheuer, a C.I.A. officer who once ran the unit tracking Osama bin Laden.","4595":"The 'real losses' that stemmed from that deception, in addition to taking resources away from the fight to destroy Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, have not only not destroyed Al Qaeda nor apprehended Osama bin Laden, but have also filled Iraq with its operatives, where there were none before, and have caused it to metastasize all over the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the world. Pierre E. Biscaye Westwood, N.J., March 18, 2005","4596":"D.H.S. declared that he was -and consequently still is -- a terrorist. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press at the time of his arrest, \"We think that if most people knew the details they would see him as someone they wouldn't want living in their community.\" Those details included the fact that before immigrating to the U.S., he had illegally crossed the Turkish border and, armed with an AK-47, a pistol and a grenade, was involved in a firefight in which two Turkish soldiers were killed. He was compared to former Nazis who had hidden their pasts to become U.S. citizens. A nearby newspaper in LaPorte County, Ind., The Herald-Argus, ran the headline \"Terrorist 22 Miles Away?\" A D.H.S. prosecutor mentioned him in the same breath as Osama bin Laden.","4597":"So in 2005, along with the bad news -- the continuing deadly insurgency in Iraq, Osama bin Laden remaining at large, terrorists regrouping from Syria to Pakistan -- there are welcome surprises all across the Arab-speaking Middle East. Moreover it is at least arguable that, taken together, these events may amount to something big, that they might constitute the cracks in the concrete that signal the impending collapse of the building.","4598":"The episode has been retold so many times in the last three and a half years that it has become the stuff of political legend: in the frenzied days after Sept. 11, 2001, when some flights were still grounded, dozens of well-connected Saudis, including relatives of Osama bin Laden, managed to leave the United States on specially chartered flights.","4599":"Andreessen is touching on the most exciting part of Globalization 3.0 and the flattening of the world: the fact that we are now in the process of connecting all the knowledge pools in the world together. We've tasted some of the downsides of that in the way that Osama bin Laden has connected terrorist knowledge pools together through his Qaeda network, not to mention the work of teenage hackers spinning off more and more lethal computer viruses that affect us all. But the upside is that by connecting all these knowledge pools we are on the cusp of an incredible new era of innovation, an era that will be driven from left field and right field, from West and East and from North and South. Only 30 years ago, if you had a choice of being born a B student in Boston or a genius in Bangalore or Beijing, you probably would have chosen Boston, because a genius in Beijing or Bangalore could not really take advantage of his or her talent. They could not plug and play globally. Not anymore. Not when the world is flat, and anyone with smarts, access to Google and a cheap wireless laptop can join the innovation fray.","46":"Twenty-eight Arabs accused of links with the militant Osama bin Laden will go on trial next week for planning attacks against American and Israeli tourists during New Year's celebrations, officials said. If found guilty, they face the death penalty. Col. Mahmoud Obeidat, the military prosecutor general, said the first hearing will be devoted to indicting the suspects, 15 of whom are in detention. The others will be tried in absentia. (AP)","460":"At 75,000 afghanis to the dollar, Haji Muhammad has to do business with a gargantuan supply of bills. He is a thin older man with a perfectly combed foot-long beard. He sees no need for confrontation with America. If Osama bin Laden, the financier of militants who has been given refuge in Afghanistan, is guilty of terrorism, he said, let America show Afghanistan the proof and a trial will be held in a court of Islamic law.","4600":"In 1998, Unocal was forced to abandon plans to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, which was then under the control of the Taliban, after the United States started bombing in an effort to destroy training camps of Osama bin Laden.","4601":"The administration is appealing the stopping of the trial of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a former driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan who is facing charges of terrorism. In his ruling, Judge James Robertson said the military commissions could not proceed because they did not provide minimally fair procedures and violated international law.","4602":"In 2001, he was involved in prosecuting four defendants accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and 17 others in the bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The four defendants were convicted in May 2001.","4603":"In 1998, when I started with the C.I.A., the director of central intelligence, George Tenet, and his underlings knew that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda were primary threats to America. Yet only a couple of officers from my class were sent to the agency's counterterrorist center. The rest of us felt sorry for these newly minted spies, as we knew that the center was considered a dumping ground for second-rate officers who were viewed as undesirable by the more traditional geographic-area divisions.","4604":"The commission report said that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, suspected of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks, sent Mr. Barot to Malaysia to receive terrorist training and, at the direction of Osama bin Laden, then sent him to the United States in early 2001 \"to case potential economic and 'Jewish' targets in New York City.\" A footnote indicated that the information came from a 2003 interrogation of Mr. Mohammed, who remains in custody at an undisclosed location.","4605":"Do you think we will ever find Osama bin Laden?","4606":"Mr. Moussaoui has admitted in open court that he was a member of Al Qaeda and a follower of Osama bin Laden, but he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 plot or any direct knowledge of it.","4607":"In July 2002, Mr. Moussaoui also sought to plead guilty to the terrorism charges, telling a stunned courtroom that he was a member of Al Qaeda and a loyal follower of Osama bin Laden. He withdrew the plea, saying that to plead guilty would amount to suicide in violation of Islamic law. It is unclear what prompted him to change his mind now, officials said.","4608":"President Bush and the neocons in his administration dragged us into that unnecessary, illegal war with a pack of lies about alleged weapons of mass destruction, ties between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden and links to 9/11.","4609":"The statement also said that Osama bin Laden \"personally selected Moussaoui to participate in the operation to fly planes into American buildings and approved Moussaoui's attacking the White House. Bin Laden told Moussaoui, 'Sahrawi, remember your dream.\"'","4610":"Saudi Arabia's plans to increase production capacity are politically and geologically sensitive. In the Middle East, the Saudis have been criticized for increasing production to help the United States; the most extreme of those critics has been Osama bin Laden.","4611":"This attention deficit is partly explained by what took place in Lower Manhattan six years after the bombing. Osama bin Laden's atrocity dwarfed Timothy McVeigh's along several dimensions -- more Americans killed by more killers with a larger political base. Though the McVeigh bombing seems not so long ago, it also seems like part of a simpler era, before we knew real danger.","4612":"United States counternarcotics agents in Afghanistan have said Mr. Noorzai was providing heroin proceeds to finance the operations of Osama bin Laden. Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican congressman from Illinois who has made two fact-finding trips to Afghanistan, said Mr. Noorzai had borrowed operatives of Al Qaeda to transport heroin out of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where American drug agents say he maintains laboratories to process opium.","4613":"The remnants of the foreign and local militants made their way into North Waziristan. According to some reports, the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri may also be in the region.","4614":"Until late last year, terrorism experts said Mr. Zarqawi had maintained his independence from Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, despite their mutual animosity toward the United States, largely because Mr. Zarqawi wanted to escape from the Saudi militant's control. But a statement in October attributed to Mr. Zarqawi urged the unification of their two efforts and asserted that Mr. Zarqawi had sworn allegiance for the first time to Mr. bin Laden.","4616":"Prosecutors also noted, in the statement of facts that accompanied the guilty plea, that he had acknowledged a personal relationship with Osama bin Laden, who is said to have had a fondness for Mr. Moussaoui, a French citizen born in Morocco. Mr. bin Laden, by this account, had selected Mr. Moussaoui to take part in an aircraft attack and urged him to \"follow his dream,\" which investigators said meant a suicide attack on the White House.","4618":"About a dozen truck drivers at ITL Inc., a wholesale fuel and transport company in suburban Los Angeles, participate in the program. Over pizza and soda in the company's warehouse-sized garage, an instructor, Richard Leimbach, showed photographs of Osama bin Laden and the inferno at the World Trade Center and schematic drawings of the explosives used by Timothy J. McVeigh in Oklahoma City.","4619":"Pakistani officials said virtually nothing about either the circumstances of Mr. Libbi's arrest or the extent of American aid in the operation. The Central Intelligence Agency has worked extensively with Pakistani agents to search for Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders in the tribal regions of the restive North-West Frontier Province.","462":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Monday, Sept. 17\u2014 Pakistan sent a group of high-ranking military officers to Afghanistan today to demand that the Taliban government hand over the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden and his top associates to the United States or face almost certain American military action, senior Pakistani officials said.","4620":"Mr. Karzai's government has always insisted that 100 to 150 members of the Taliban government and other antigovernment rebels who have committed crimes would be excluded from the reconciliation program. American military officials have also talked of a \"blacklist\" of the most wanted members of the former government that harbored Osama bin Laden and operatives of Al Qaeda for five years until October 2001. Mr. Hekmatyar is also wanted in connection with terrorist attacks against United States forces, American commanders have said.","4621":"Abu Faraj al-Libbi, the Libyan described as the third-most-senior leader in Al Qaeda's network, is still in Pakistani custody and will not handed over to the United States quickly, Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, said. 'Until all the issues are cleared, there is no question of him being handed over to anyone else,' he said. 'Anything relevant to American security is being shared.' Pakistan announced the arrest last week. Mr. Libbi is suspected of orchestrating two assassination attempts on Pakistan's president and of heading a plot to kill its prime minister. A number of arrests followed the seizure of Mr. Libbi near Peshawar, and officials say the army has stepped up the hunt for Osama bin Laden. If he is alive, Mr. Kasuri speculated, he is probably continually moving between the tribal areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and not with a large group of people, 'otherwise he'd be detected.' Salman Masood (NYT)","4622":"Little is publicly known about Mr. Yemeni, who is not listed by that name on any of the government's publicly available lists of most-wanted terrorist suspects. But the former officials said he had been under surveillance by the C.I.A., whose officers have been working with American Special Forces inside Pakistan for more than two years as part of the hunt for Osama bin Laden and other senior members of Al Qaeda. The C.I.A. maintains close working relations with Pakistan's main intelligence service.","4624":"Although he pursued postgraduate work in architecture, he became increasingly religious while living in Germany and began leading religious discussion groups; when he moved to the United States to learn how to fly planes, he told his parents that he was pursuing a Ph.D. in urban planning. Shortly before pledging his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, Atta reportedly asked his mother if he could move back to Egypt to care for her. \"It was almost as if,\" Mr. McDermott writes, \"he were asking someone else to stop him from something he knew he couldn't stop himself from doing.\"","4625":"Had the Bush administration adhered to Mr. Brooks's wise counsel, it would have never diverted critical resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for the attack on Saddam Hussein, a bloody despot but one who posed no threat to us or to our interests in the region.","4626":"The United States commands a foreign force in Afghanistan of about 18,300, most of them Americans, fighting Taliban insurgents and hunting militant leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","4627":"The Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist party that controlled Afghanistan and was allied with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, was ousted by the United States three and a half years ago. But the group is still considered a major player in large parts of the country, particularly in the mountainous eastern region that borders Pakistan.","4628":"BuzzMetrics tracked the frequency with which \"buzz topics\" -- Mary Cheney, the Osama bin Laden tape and so forth -- appeared in the last two months of the campaign, not just on blogs but also on other \"channels\": the mainstream media, official campaign statements and other Internet forums like newsgroups. The resulting \"fever lines\" charting the results on a graph, the study's authors suggest, offer a glimpse into which channels set the agenda and which react in response.","4629":"The claim that Mr. Zarqawi was injured followed a series of unconfirmed reports that the Jordanian-born militant, named by Osama bin Laden as Al Qaeda's chief representative in Iraq, sought hospital treatment in the past month in at least two cities in the desert of western Iraq.","463":"To counter Moscow's daring plan, we covertly supported the Afghans with guerrilla training and anti-aircraft weapons. Sure enough, with our secret aid and with the help of adventurous Muslim volunteers from all over -- including one rich young Saudi named Osama bin Laden -- the Afghans stunned the world by breaking the will of the Red Army. Our spymaster was prescient: that demoralizing, decade-long military defeat did begin the end of Communism's evil empire.","4630":"In Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Sunni demonstrators reportedly raised pictures of Osama bin Laden and the militant leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is thought to be leading the anti-American insurgency in Iraq.","4631":"But what has most separated America from the old exigencies of 9/11 -- and therefore from the fate of ground zero -- is, at long last, the decoupling of the war on terror from the war on Iraq. The myth fostered by the administration that Saddam Hussein conspired in the 9/11 attacks is finally dead and so, apparently, is the parallel myth that Iraqis were among that day's hijackers. Our initial, post-9/11 war against Al Qaeda -- the swift and decisive victory over the Taliban -- is now seen as both a discrete event and ancient history (as is the hope of nailing Osama bin Laden dead or alive); Afghanistan itself has fallen off the American radar screen except as a site for burgeoning poppy production and the deaths of detainees in American custody. In its place stands only the war in Iraq, which is increasingly seen as an add-on to the war provoked by 9/11 and whose unpopularity grows by the day.","4632":"The arrests came as part of a two-year sting operation that ended with each man facing a single conspiracy charge. While the authorities said that they had no evidence that either man had actually provided support to terrorists, they said they had taped each man swearing his allegiance to Osama bin Laden, Mr. Browne said.","4633":"Whereas people like Mr. Grecula might have garnered sporadic attention from investigators before Sept. 11, or led to a long-term intelligence investigation stretching over years, undercover agents and prosecutors are now moving with urgent speed, officials say. Mr. Grecula was arrested just three weeks after a man he knew from prison reported to the F.B.I. that Mr. Grecula had approached him about finding someone willing to pay for a powerful bomb, even Osama bin Laden, prosecutors said. The tip set in motion a series of taped phone calls and meetings that led to Mr. Grecula's arrest.","4634":"Asked whether the United States had ever been close to capturing Osama bin Laden, Mr. Cheney said, \"I can't say that we've ever been close to bin Laden.\"","4635":"Flight logs show a C.I.A. plane left Dulles within 48 hours of the capture of several Al Qaeda leaders, flying to airports near the place of arrest. They included Abu Zubaida, a close aide to Osama bin Laden, captured on March 28, 2002; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who helped plan 9/11 from Hamburg, Germany, on Sept. 10, 2002; Abd al-Rahim al-Nashri, the Qaeda operational chief in the Persian Gulf region, on Nov. 8, 2002; and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the architect of 9/11, on March 1, 2003.","4636":"Voice Claiming to Be Zarqawi's Calls Wounds Minor In a 17-minute audio message addressed to Osama bin Laden, a man claiming to be Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the United States' most wanted man in Iraq, said that his wounds were slight and that he was still in Iraq. PAGE A9 Girl, 11, Killed; Girl, 9, Held An argument over a ball at a Brooklyn apartment led a 9-year-old girl to take a steak knife and fatally stab another girl, who was 11, the police said, adding that no one in the New York Police Department could remember anyone so young being implicated in such an act.

A15 Trappings of a Modern Dynasty Like the Adamses, Roosevelts, Tafts, Kennedys, Gores and Bushes before them, the Cheneys -- Vice President Dick Cheney, his wife Lynne, and their daughters Elizabeth and Mary -- are a family act, a foursome fully immersed in conservative politics and public policy. All the Cheneys have advanced degrees, a demon work ethic and a devotion to free enterprise and the projection of American power.

Mr. Clinton was well aware of the threat; \"terrorism is the enemy of our generation, and we must prevail,\" he declared in 1996. But when his pleas for more urgent and imaginative initiatives against Osama bin Laden were met with resistance from the military and federal bureaucracy, Mr. Harris says, he exhibited a \"willingness to yield rather than confront obstacles within his own government.\"","4639":"The decisive moment, federal prosecutors allege, came on May 20 in a ground-floor apartment off the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. There, gathered together for the first and only time, were the principals in what federal and local authorities say was a developing scheme to aid Al Qaeda: a jazz musician and martial arts expert; an emergency room doctor with a Columbia University medical degree who had worked in New York and Florida and had just returned from Saudi Arabia; and an undercover F.B.I. agent posing as a recruiter for Osama bin Laden's terror network.","464":"We would be surprised if these guidelines were the reason there was no warning about last week's attacks. The more likely explanation is that intelligence agencies, with White House and Congressional concurrence, have neglected the cultivation of foreign informants in recent decades in favor of valuable but extremely expensive technical collection systems like spy satellites. These technologies, which can intercept millions of intercontinental phone calls and show a license plate from 200 miles out in space, have served the nation well. They cannot, however, tell the president what Osama bin Laden said yesterday to his henchmen in a mud hut in the mountains of Afghanistan.","4640":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 30 - In a rambling 17-minute audio message addressed to Osama bin Laden, the voice of a man claiming to be Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the United States' most wanted man in Iraq, acknowledged reports that he had been wounded but said that his wounds were slight and that he was still in Iraq.","4641":"On the tape, Mr. Zarqawi addressed himself to Osama bin Laden as a \"soldier to his emir,\" and said that he had been wounded but not seriously and that he was in Iraq. It appeared to be a response to reports speculating that he might have been gravely wounded and had slipped out of the country for medical care.","4642":"\"Shah committed himself to the path of holy war, to the oath of secrecy, and to abide by the directives of Al Qaeda,\" according to the criminal complaint filed by prosecutors. \"Shah indicated that he understood the oath, and agreed that he would obey the guardians of the oath, namely, Sheikh Osama bin Laden.\" Dr. Sabir pledged the same oath, the complaint said.","4643":"On the tape, Mr. Zarqawi pledged loyalty to Osama bin Laden, and said he had been wounded, but only slightly. The American military in recent weeks conducted several operations in western Iraq against the insurgency, a mix of indigenous Sunni Arabs and foreign fighters like Mr. Zarqawi.","4644":"He said he did not know where Mullah Omar or the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, were hiding, but suggested that they took refuge in neighboring Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban government in late 2001. Wherever Mr. bin Laden was, Mr. Baghrani predicted he would be caught one day, because he was not among his own people and, as a result, risked betrayal.","4645":"It was unclear who carried out the attack, but adherents of the conservative Salafiya sect, another branch of Sunni Islam, have killed Sufis for centuries and desecrated their tombs, denouncing them as infidels. Prominent Salafi fighters include Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant, and Osama bin Laden.","4646":"If they could capture this Jordanian-born militant, anointed by Osama bin Laden as Al Qaeda's chief in Iraq, American commanders are hoping, they could strike a compelling, perhaps decisive, blow against one crucial component of the Iraqi insurgency -- the Islamic militant groups that draw zealots from across the Arab Middle East to carry out suicide bombings, beheadings and other atrocities.","4647":"Whimsy always gets a front-row seat at the Webbys, and this year Dogster.com, a San Francisco Web site, picked up a community award for its creation of a virtual playground for pets and their owners. BoingBoing.net, whose idiosyncratic approach to what constitutes information worth sharing -- robot bands, storm chasers or an Osama bin Laden cigarette lighter replete with World Trade Center towers -- received top blogging honors.","4648":"In a new book, a Republican congressman denounces the Central Intelligence Agency, accusing it of 'gross incompetence' for dismissing an Iranian expatriate who he says offered critical information about terrorist threats, the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and Iran's nuclear weapons program.","4649":"The report provides new information about the bureau's mishandling of a warning from an agent in Phoenix in July 2001 about Middle Eastern extremists connected to Osama bin Laden using American schools to receive aviation training.","465":"Extension Activities:1. Create a profile of Osama bin Laden (this may take one of many forms, such as a video, an essay, or a poster). Address the following questions in your profile: Where did or does bin Laden get his money? What is his military training? Why was he exiled from Saudi Arabia? With what terrorist attacks has he been associated? What public statements has he made against the United States or other countries? 2. Do you think that it is appropriate to \u201creturn to a state of normalcy\u201d now, or is it too soon for people to completely recover from these events? What do you think \u201cnormalcy\u201d will come to mean? Write a letter to the editor of your school or local paper explaining your position. (You might also submit a letter to The Learning Network for possible publication on the site at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/leetters/submit.html.) 3. Explore ways in which your school community can help those directly affected in the attacks. Consider a story you have heard in the news that moved you, and organize a service project so that you and your classmates can respond to help the people involved (some suggestions include food or clothing drives, letter-writing campaigns and fundraisers). 4. What is a \u201chero\u201d? Describe in words the characteristics that comprise a hero. Your response may take many forms, such as a poem, a short story, or a journal. You may want to focus on specific acts of heroism you have heard about or witnessed since the terrorist attacks took place, or offer more general descriptions of a hero. 5. Read the story \u201cOn the Rainy River\u201d from the book \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d by Tim O\u2019Brien. Write an essay defending or challenging O\u2019Brien\u2019s final decision to go to war. Would you go to war if you were drafted tomorrow? Why or why not? How are your reasons different than or similar to Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s? 6. Research draft policies in your country (if you country does not have a draft, research one that does). Write an essay that answers the following questions: When was the last draft in your country? Who is eligible to be drafted? What are the penalties for \u201cdraft dodging\u201d? Why does this country have a draft?","4650":"The new dispute about juveniles involves other prisoners. In addition to M.C., there is Omar Khadr, a Canadian detainee, now 18, whose case is widely known. He is accused of throwing a grenade that killed an American medic near Khost, in eastern Afghanistan. Moreover, the authorities say his father was an associate of Osama bin Laden.","4651":"No wonder the Pakistan government can't catch Osama bin Laden. It is too busy harassing, detaining - and now kidnapping - a gang-rape victim for daring to protest and for planning a visit to the United States.","4652":"He said the prisoners included trainers, bomb makers, recruiters, financiers, bodyguards for Osama bin Laden and would-be suicide bombers. \"They're not common car thieves,\" he added. \"They're believed to be determined killers.\"","4653":"Being allies with Pakistan should go beyond just selling F-16 fighter jets to General Musharraf in the hope that he will one day get serious about finding Osama bin Laden and stop allowing recruiters for the Taliban to operate in Pakistan. It should also include pressing Pakistan to adopt minimum standards of human rights.","4654":"The authorities eventually charged Mr. Hamdan with crimes involving terrorism, asserting that he was a driver and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden. A federal judge halted his trial, saying the military commissions were unconstitutional. The government has appealed.","4655":"Dr. Zawahiri received his medical training in Egypt and served time here for his role in militant activities. After his release, he moved to Afghanistan, where he joined forces with Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, in the late 1990's. He went into hiding when the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001.","4656":"But those two policies have sometimes clashed, as the administration has sought the cooperation of Sudan, which harbored Osama bin Laden in the mid-1990's, as well as Uzbekistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other authoritarian governments.","4657":"Mr. Zadran, 53, was once the Taliban's top spokesman in the United States. In the days before the Sept. 11 attacks, he said in interviews that Osama bin Laden was \"a guest of our country\" and that the Taliban itself had received promises from Mr. bin Laden \"that no act of terror would be initiated from our soil.\"","4658":"In a 15-page letter, the lawyer, Stephen M. Kohn, wrote that the F.B.I.'s top counterterrorism officials said in sworn depositions that they did not know the relationship between Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah, a South Asia offshoot of the terror network. Nor were they aware of the link between Osama bin Laden and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a spiritual adviser to Mr. bin Laden with whom he had been associated since the 1980's.","4659":"In some cases, agents used subpoenas or other formal demands to obtain information like lists of users checking out a book on Osama bin Laden. Other requests were informal -- and were sometimes turned down by librarians who chafed at the notion of turning over such material, said the American Library Association, which commissioned the study.","466":"Mr. Omar, who runs the De Afghanan Fine Kabob and Tandoori House, and his brother, Wais, a manager at a Silicon Valley electronics company, plan to distribute posters that show an X across the face of Osama bin Laden, who is the prime suspect in Tuesday's attacks. The posters also carry a strongly worded message: 'The Afghan Community wants Mr. bin Laden out of their country and will not take the blame for Terrorism.'","4660":"The American Library Association has identified at least 200 cases in which law enforcement officials made requests for information from libraries since October 2001. Some of the requests sought information about people who read specific materials, like a book about Osama bin Laden. The study did not determine how many of the requests were made under Section 215, but that would have been difficult, since Section 215 makes it illegal for libraries to report when such requests are made.","4662":"The officials said the report spelled out how the urban nature of the war in Iraq was helping combatants learn how to carry out assassinations, kidnappings, car bombings and other kinds of attacks that were never a staple of the fighting in Afghanistan during the anti-Soviet campaigns of the 1980's. It was during that conflict, primarily rural and conventional, that the United States provided arms to Osama bin Laden and other militants, who later formed Al Qaeda.","4663":"The United States military command, eager to show progress against the insurgents when Congressional critics of the war have been pressing their doubts in Washington, found solace on Thursday in an unexpected quarter. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born militant who has been named Al Qaeda's chief in Iraq by Osama bin Laden, said in a posting on the Internet that one of Saudi Arabia's most-wanted militants had been killed by a coalition airstrike in Qaim, on the Syrian border.","4664":"IT is one of the more overworked words in America today: closure, the suggestion that a single moment or event will somehow end the abiding pain of having lost a loved one. If Osama bin Laden is ever captured, we are sure to hear talk of closure. Are we to believe that every 9/11 family will then find peace?","4665":"In a rare, direct reference to Osama bin Laden's periodic menacing messages, he quoted the Qaeda leader as declaring that \"this third world war\" is now raging in Iraq and that it would end in \"victory and glory or misery and humiliation.\"","4666":"Using language that infuriates his opponents who say there is no link between the Iraq war and Al Qaeda, he specifically cast the battle in Iraq as part of the bigger conflict that began with the Sept. 11 attacks, which he mentioned explicitly five times and alluded to at others, and invoked the specter of Osama bin Laden.","4667":"How different things might have been if we had used the overwhelming force needed to find Osama bin Laden and his associates when we had the choice and the chance. Felicia Massarsky Ocean Grove, N.J., June 29, 2005","4668":"Wildwood's beach is exceptional, up to a quarter-mile wide in some places, clean, protected and free to all comers. But there's also that boardwalk, two miles long and as honky-tonk as ever. It's still the home of henna tattoo parlors, carnival game barkers, monster truck rides, palm readers, paintball with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein as targets and screamingly terrifying rides. The entire panorama is perfumed by pizza, French fries and funnel cake. Summer crowds, intense all over the island as the population climbs to 250,000 from 13,000 year-round, can be daunting.","4669":"Never mind that Iraq posed no threat before we invaded. Now it's a \"central front in the war on terror,\" Mr. Bush says, quoting Osama bin Laden as an authority. And since a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq would, Mr. Bush claims, be a victory for Al Qaeda, Americans have to support this war -- and that means supporting him. After all, you wage war with the president you have, not the president you want.","467":"Their motives are different. Russia sees links between Afghanistan and rebellions in its own Muslim areas, while the United States is focused on Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of terrorism. But their common cause in reining in and perhaps dislodging the Taliban appears strong for now.","4670":"MONGO: Adventures in Trash, by Ted Botha. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) When Botha moved from South Africa to New York in the 1990's, he furnished his whole apartment with 'mongo' (slang for garbage salvaged from streets and trash heaps). Each of his book's 10 entertaining chapters is devoted to a different type of mongo hunter, from pack rats to preservationists. MOANIN' AT MIDNIGHT: The Life and Times of Howlin' Wolf, by James Segrest and Mark Hoffman. (Thunder's Mouth, $16.95.) Standing at least 6 feet 3 and weighing 300 pounds, the gravelly-voiced Howlin' Wolf (1910-76) transformed Mississippi's country blues into the electric urban blues of Chicago. Segrest and Hoffman's engrossing biography traces Wolf's sharecropper beginnings (he was born Chester Burnett in the hamlet of White Station, Miss.); details the musicians, like Charley Patton, who influenced him; and explores the evolution of his musical style and stagecraft. Our reviewer, David Gates, called the book 'this generation's first and probably last full portrait of one of the giants of American music.' Yale University Press has issued a new paperback edition of Chris Albertson's BESSIE ($20), an exemplary biography of the great blues singer Bessie Smith, first published in 1972. A GIRL BECOMES A COMMA LIKE THAT, by Lisa Glatt. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $12.) This appealingly dark first novel, sliced up into 11 elliptical stories, revolves around Rachel Spark, a discombobulated California poet who moves back home when her mother develops terminal cancer. NOTHING LOST, by John Gregory Dunne. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.95.) Dunne's gripping final novel (he died of a heart attack at 71 in 2003) is set in a plains state called South Midland and tells the story of a black drifter, two men who killed him and the media circus and political jockeying that surround their trial. The mystery unfolds as Dunne pieces together his characters' past: the drifter, Edgar Parlance; his accused murderer, Duane Lajoie; and Duane's brilliant but tortured lawyer, Teresa Kean. 'I make 'Nothing Lost' to be a book of fate,' Ward Just wrote here, 'the one we make for ourselves or, much more frequently in Dunne's unforgiving world, the one that's made for us.' A PRETEXT FOR WAR: 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies, by James Bamford. (Anchor, $15.) In this damning portrait of the country's intelligence agencies, Bamford gives a full account of the failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks; describes the rise of Osama bin Laden and the C.I.A.'s inability to track him; and argues that misinformation and ideological agendas led to the decision to go to war in Iraq. In THE IRAQ WAR (Vintage, $14), the military historian John Keegan appraises the initial campaign in Iraq and retraces the steps that led to war. BRILLIANCE OF THE MOON: Tales of the Otori, Book 3, by Lian Hearn. (Riverhead, $14.) Like the first two volumes in Hearn's series, 'Across the Nightingale Floor' and 'Grass for His Pillow,' this novel is a combat epic set in an imaginary medieval Japan, where a warrior hero of mixed heritage, Takeo Otori, fights to fulfill his destiny to unite the Three Countries. Ihsan Taylor","4671":"Op-Ed Contributor Peter Bergen is a fellow of the New America Foundation and the author of \"Holy War Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden.\"","4672":"The statement announcing the killing was posted on a Web site frequently used by Al Qaeda in Iraq, which is led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born militant named by Osama bin Laden as Al Qaeda's chief representative here. The announcement said that Mr. Sharif's \"confessions were taped,\" but the 90-second video included nothing that resembled an apology.","4673":"Since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Osama bin Laden and other groups have threatened to attack Britain in retaliation for its support of the United States. Last April, Mr. bin Laden demanded that Britain and other American allies pull out of Iraq by July 15, 2004. The deadline passed without incident.","4674":"That fear has already led to questions about why the British security agencies did not anticipate the attacks, why the wealthy nations have not done enough about the root causes of terrorism and why Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden continue to function after almost four years of the so-called war on terrorism. Many will wonder why the United States is mired in Iraq while Al Qaeda's leader still roams free.","4675":"That, too, is deeply troubling. The more Western societies -- particularly the big European societies, which have much larger Muslim populations than America -- look on their own Muslims with suspicion, the more internal tensions this creates, and the more alienated their already alienated Muslim youth become. This is exactly what Osama bin Laden dreamed of with 9/11: to create a great gulf between the Muslim world and the globalizing West.","4676":"Perhaps the silence from the Muslim world about Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi says it all. Bill Lippincott Del Mar, Calif., July 8, 2005","4677":"\"It is not going to be Osama bin Laden coming down Fifth Avenue,\" said the instructor, Sgt. Jim Mastricovo, a New York police officer who also teaches at the Police Academy. \"It is going to be anybody -- the most inconspicuous, the most benign person you can see.\"","4678":"By contrast, imagine what would have happened if we had focused the money and men that we spent and diverted in Iraq on the retaliatory, swift, overwhelming destruction of Osama bin Laden and his henchmen. James Adler Cambridge, Mass., July 8, 2005","4679":"To make sense of this campaign, I compiled data on the 71 terrorists who killed themselves between 1995 and 2004 in carrying out attacks sponsored by Osama bin Laden's network. I was able to collect the names, nationalities and detailed demographic information on 67 of these bombers, data that provides insight into the underlying causes of Al Qaeda's suicide terrorism and how the group's strategy has evolved since 2001.","468":"Investigators are examining a link between two hijackers who attacked the World Trade Center and a former Boston cab driver who is on trial for a foiled plot to kill Americans in Jordan on Jan. 1, 2000. The three shared a relationship with a suspected operative for Osama bin Laden.","4680":"But if we look for only a moment at Iraq, where battling terrorists clearly requires more forces than defeating Saddam Hussein did, we ought to see that the nature of war is changing from the model of World War II or even the Persian Gulf War. And if we consider the apocalyptic goals of Osama bin Laden and the practices of the Taliban when they were in power, we ought to know that we are not dealing with Gerry Adams's Sinn Fein.","4681":"Moroccan authorities, for example, are seeking the return of Mohammed el-Guerbozi, a battle-hardened veteran of Afghanistan who they say planned the May 2003 attacks in Casablanca, which killed 45 people. He has also been identified as a founder of the Moroccan Combatant Islamic Group, cited by the United Nations as a terrorist network connected to Al Qaeda. An operative in that group, Noureddine Nifa, told investigators that the organization had sleeper cells prepared to mount synchronized bombings in Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and Canada. In an interview last year, Gen. Hamidou Laanigri, Morocco's chief of security, said Osama bin Laden authorized Mr. Guerbozi to open a training camp for Moroccans in Afghanistan in the beginning of 2001. Last December, Mr. Guerbozi was convicted in absentia in Morocco for his involvement in the Casablanca attacks and sentenced to 20 years.","4682":"In a claim posted on the Internet, a group calling itself the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades and named for a former lieutenant of Osama bin Laden took responsibility for the attack. The group has taken responsibility for attacks in Turkey and Spain, but the police have tended to be skeptical about the authenticity of its claims. Mr. Paddick said British investigators would not \"rule out anything that might be useful.\"","4683":"\"We believe that up to 3,000 British born or British-based people have passed though Osama bin Laden's training camps over the years,\" he said. \"Plainly, not all went on to become active Islamic terrorists back in the U.K., but some have. \"","4684":"American officials have also suggested that whatever remains of the core of Qaeda, headed by Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants, probably has little interest in squandering its resources on a small-scale attack. The bombings in London appear to have claimed fewer than 100 lives, compared with the nearly 3,000 killed in the Sept. 11 attacks, and most American intelligence officials have long said they believed that Al Qaeda remained determined to surpass Sept. 11 in scope.","4685":"It is not known whether the attackers in London had ties to Osama bin Laden. In Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiyah, a militant group with a similar outlook that is believed to have had ties with Al Qaeda, is accused of the bombing of the Bali nightclubs, in October 2002, and the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, in August 2003. Like Al Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah has been \"severely weakened,\" because nearly 200 of its members have been arrested, said Sidney Jones, who is widely considered the leading specialist on the organization and who is the director of the regional office of the International Crisis Group.","4686":"The survey found widely differing views of Osama bin Laden in Muslim countries, with the proportion of people feeling confidence in him as a world leader ranging from 7 percent in Turkey (compared with 15 percent two years ago) to 60 percent in Jordan (an increase of five percentage points since 2003).","4687":"The statement said Mr. Fahdawi was among the \"close confidantes\" of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian named by Osama bin Laden as the top Qaeda leader in Iraq. Two days ago, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed the July 10 capture of a man he said was Mr. Zarqawi's chief operative in Baghdad, Abdullah Ibrahim Muhammad Hassan al-Shadad, or Abu Abdul Aziz.","4688":"Their ruling, in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for Osama bin Laden, was a significant legal victory for the administration, which has found itself engaged in several court battles over tools that officials say they need to fight terrorist groups.","4689":"A counterweight to those groups is the recently formed National Dialogue Council, headed by a wealthy agricultural entrepreneur and Baath Party proponent named Saleh al-Mutlak. It trades insults with the Iraqi Islamic Party, with each accusing the other of lacking a real following. The precursor to the council was a political group founded in late 2003 and made up mostly of Salafis -- fundamentalist Sunnis who count Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi among their fellow worshippers.","469":"The 19-member NATO alliance has said it will regard the attack on the United States as an attack on all the allies if the Bush administration determines that the attack was 'directed from abroad.' While the administration has pointed an accusing finger at Osama bin Laden and his network in Afghanistan, it has not yet made that formal determination.","4690":"Earlier this year the administration revealed that Osama bin Laden had communicated with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of \"Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia,\" urging him to send some of his many fighters to the homelands of the United States and its coalition allies. Zarqawi's network has apparently been quite successful in recruiting new terrorists in Arab nations and in Islamic communities in Europe. Before the London attacks, the police arrested Zarqawi recruiters in Britain, Germany, Spain and elsewhere. (Among those arrested in Spain was a terrorist thought to be connected to the Madrid attacks.) Iraq acts both as a motivator for the new jihadis and as a training ground. It has replaced Afghanistan, Chechnya and Bosnia. Now, Muslim radical youth go to Iraq to prove themselves and learn the trade of terror.","4691":"Although Iran has refused to identify those it has arrested, citing security reasons, Mr. Younessi gave the name of a ringleader he said was still at large. The man, Abdul Malek, was linked to a group of fighters close to Osama bin Laden who collaborated with drug traffickers, Mr. Younessi said. 'The group intended to sabotage and carry out terrorist attacks in Iranian cities, especially in Tehran,' the IRNA news agency quoted him as saying. 'Most of their members were identified and arrested. Their ringleader is Abdul Malek who lives in Baluchistan in Pakistan but sometimes enters eastern Iran illegally,' he added.","4692":"In a statement, the Pentagon said that the two trials set to resume quickly would be those of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who was a driver in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, and David Hicks, an Australian who was captured in Afghanistan, where, prosecutors say, he had gone to fight for the Taliban government. As a practical matter, the trials may resume 50 days after Friday's ruling, officials said.","4693":"Judge Baltazar Garz\u00f3n of Spain, using the new European procedure, issued a European warrant against Mr. Darkazanli last year, accusing him of being the \"permanent interlocutor and assistant\" in Europe for Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden.","4694":"According to current and former American diplomats, Prince Turki tried in the 1990's to persuade the Taliban to return Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia to stand trial for plotting against the Saudi government. The prince currently serves as the ambassador in London.","4695":"LONDON, July 20 - Britain struck a preliminary agreement with Jordan on Wednesday that may lead to the expulsion of a suspected close ally of Osama bin Laden, the first in a series of measures aimed at curtailing the activities of militant clerics.","4696":"Mr. Aswat is believed to have met Osama bin Laden sometime in the late 1990's, senior investigators said. He trained at Qaeda-run camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they said.","4698":"Sheik Bakri has said Osama bin Laden warned European countries with troops in Iraq last April, giving them 90 days for them to remove their troops. No one listened, he said.","4699":"Relations between the United States and Sudan have been strained for more than a decade. In 1997 the United States withdrew its ambassador, accusing Sudan of sponsoring terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, who lived here for part of the 1990's. Last year, however, the United States helped broker a peace agreement in a 20-year civil war between the central government and rebels in the south. But Darfur has overshadowed that accomplishment.","47":"Fifteen suspected followers of the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden pleaded not guilty to charges of plotting terrorist attacks in Jordan. The trial of the 15, 3 of whom are seen at left, opened in Amman and was adjourned to May 7. Twenty-eight suspects, 13 of them still at large, are accused of having conspired to attack places frequented by tourists in Jordan during millennium celebrations. (Reuters)","470":"President Bush, recalling frontier 'dead or alive' wanted posters, says he wants Osama bin Laden brought to justice. But he also warns Americans against the harassment of Arabs and Muslims in the United States, saying 'the face of terror is not the true faith of Islam.' A1","4700":"LAHORE, Pakistan, July 21 - Relatives of one suspect in the July 7 London bombings confirmed on Thursday that he had visited their family house in a remote village in central Pakistan late last year, but denied statements attributed to them in the Pakistani press that he was an ardent supporter of Osama bin Laden.","4702":"The Afghans have surprised him. \"They all love Bush, because he liberated their country,\" he said, \"and they all say Osama bin Laden is Bush's friend,\" suggesting that in their minds there is a conspiracy that allows Al Qaeda's leader to remain at large.","4703":"In each case, the attack was quickly described by authorities as having \"the hallmarks of Al Qaeda,\" in the sense that it involved synchronized strikes or sophistication in planning. But to date, none have been traced to Osama bin Laden, the fugitive leader of Al Qaeda, or to other pivotal leaders of what American officials now call Al Qaeda central, to distinguish from its offshoots, admirers and those who its successes have simply inspired.","4704":"Consider this: Osama bin Laden continued killing Americans and Western Europeans in the aftermath of Sept. 11, though indirectly. How? A large number of travelers chose to drive rather than fly, and this caused a corresponding rise in casualties from automobile accidents (any time we drive more than 20 miles, our risk of death exceeds that of flying).","4705":"But Al Qaeda's true form these days is a question mark. A majority of the officials interviewed call it a badly hobbled, barely functioning organization. Its top commanders have been captured or killed, and its two top leaders -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri -- have been in hiding for nearly four years.","4706":"Mr. Tanweer's maternal uncle, Tahir Pervez, said Mr. Tanweer had visited the family home in a dusty village, Kota Chotiya, near the central Pakistani city of Faisalabad. Mr. Pervez had recounted his nephew's admiration for Osama bin Laden, a Pakistani newspaper reported.","4707":"Prince Turki's appointment will be difficult for some Americans. In his role as Saudi intelligence chief, he oversaw the kingdom's dangerous dance with Osama bin Laden, both during and after the campaign to drive the Soviets from Afghanistan. Indeed, in 2002, Prince Turki was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by families of Sept. 11 victims claiming that official Saudi negligence had facilitated Al Qaeda's operations (the portion of the suit naming Prince Turki was dismissed this year).","4708":"Mr. Hackett has been bluntly dismissive of Mr. Bush, saying the United States should have focused on capturing Osama bin Laden instead of invading Iraq so quickly. In a public forum, he called Mr. Bush the biggest threat facing the United States, a remark that has infuriated voters, Republicans say.","4709":"Forget the philosophical debates (first raised by the critic T.W. Adorno in reference to the Holocaust) about the morality of artists' trying to depict an \"unimaginable ordeal.\" Forget the moral debates about how art can trivialize history. A mere four years after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we've fast-forwarded to the point where at least two comic novels make Osama bin Laden the object of their heroines' romantic fantasies: in both \"Incendiary\" and Helen Fielding's ridiculous 2004 novel, \"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination,\" women dream of persuading this terrorist in chief to renounce terrorism, literally to Make Love, Not War.","471":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 17\u2014 President Bush declared at the Pentagon this morning that he wanted Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in last week's terrorist strikes, brought to justice, and he pointedly recalled the frontier posters urging the capture of criminals 'dead or alive.'","4710":"Senior investigators have said that Mr. Aswat was believed to have met Osama bin Laden sometime in the late 1990's and that he trained at Qaeda-run camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan.","4711":"Judge Johnson also narrated the events of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, explaining that while Sheik Moayad was not being sentenced for those acts, he came to the attention of prosecutors shortly afterward. It was then that a Yemeni informer came forward to say that Sheik Moayad had boasted of personally delivering $20 million to Osama bin Laden.","4712":"Our soldiers are dying in Iraq while participating in a war that is not preventing terrorism, but only increasing it. While we are terrorizing the people in Iraq, that war and the people we are killing there have become a rallying cry against American militarism and are promoting the recruitment of Osama bin Laden-style terrorists. Arthur M. Pierson Poughkeepsie, N.Y., July 25, 2005","4713":"It would be hard to find a more telling symbol of the contradictory nature of Saudi-American relations than Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudis' new ambassador to the United States. As head of Saudi intelligence from 1977 until Aug. 31, 2001, he personally managed Riyadh's relations with Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar of the Taliban. Anyone else who had dealings with even a small fraction of the notorious characters the prince has worked with over the years would never make it past the immigration counter at Dulles Airport, let alone to the most exclusive offices in Washington.","4714":"Could that -- ever -- happen with Osama bin Laden?","4715":"Investigators also have been examining the ties to the United States of a 31-year-old British man, Haroon Rashid Aswat, who was wanted for questioning in connection with the London bombings. Investigators believe that Mr. Aswat has met Osama bin Laden and trained at camps run by Al Qaeda.","4717":"The two trials expected to resume shortly are those of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who was a driver in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden; and David Hicks, an Australian who was captured in Afghanistan, where, prosecutors say, he had gone to fight for the Taliban government.","4718":"During King Fahd's reign he and the royal family found a marriage of convenience with Wahhabism, the conservative branch of Islam that in its more radical forms helped fuel the rise of militancy in far-flung reaches of the Muslim world. But after the emergence of Osama bin Laden in the 1980's and Al Qaeda in the 1990's; the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis; and after a later bombing campaign in the kingdom itself, the Saudi rulers grudgingly admitted that their seeming tolerance of the extremism was beginning to threaten their own grip on power.","4719":"Although King Fahd was incapacitated by a stroke and by what was rumored in the diplomatic community to be Alzheimer's by the time Osama bin Laden's followers began their bloody bombing campaign, his response to the earlier violent challenges set the tone for the way the royal tribe responded to the accusations that it was insufficiently devout to maintain its control over the two holiest mosques in Islam.","472":"It is not enough to go after Osama bin Laden and his followers. Innumerable Islamic terrorists are ready to fill their shoes. It is not enough to wipe out Afghanistan. The many other terrorist nations will carry on the mission.","4720":"The recent appointment of Prince Turki al-Faisal as ambassador to the United States affords an opportunity for blunt diplomacy. The prince, who ran Saudi intelligence for a quarter-century, knows far more than his predecessor, Prince Bandar, about the labyrinth of Islamic extremism; he even negotiated with Osama bin Laden and Taliban officials in his intelligence role. He may not become the social fixture in Washington that Prince Bandar was, but he is a pragmatist who will understand, and convey to Riyadh, straight talk from Washington.","4721":"The impact of terrorism is more direct in \"Incendiary\" (Alfred A. Knopf, $22.95), narrated by a woman whose husband and small son have been killed by the stadium bomb. The novel is shaped as her letter to Osama bin Laden, a form that is both an attention-getting trick (it's hard to ignore a book that begins \"Dear Osama\") and an effective literary device. This unnamed woman has been driven mad by grief; it becomes increasingly clear that the letter is a symptom of her derangement.","4722":"We have learned a lot about the jihadists, from Osama bin Laden down to the Europeans who attacked the London subways last month. We know, thanks to a database gathered by Marc Sageman, formerly of the C.I.A., that about 75 percent of anti-Western terrorists come from middle-class or upper-middle-class homes. An amazing 65 percent have gone to college, and three-quarters have professional or semiprofessional jobs, particularly in engineering and science.","4723":"United States intelligence officials have repeatedly said that Osama bin Laden is likely to be holed up in the Hindu Kush mountains along the frontier. Lately, Afghan and Pakistani officials have traded barbs about who is harboring whom, and who has failed to find them.","4724":"Also on Thursday, a videotape was broadcast showing Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's deputy to Osama bin Laden, declaring that there would be more bloodshed in London. Mr. Zawahiri said any additional terror attacks would be the fault of the British prime minister, Tony Blair. 'Blair has brought to you destruction in central London, and he will bring more of that, God willing,' Mr. Zawahiri said in the tape, which was broadcast on the satellite channel Al Jazeera. The tape's authenticity could not be immediately verified.","4725":"If the president and his advisers had spent their time finding Osama bin Laden, the anthrax murderer or murderers and real threats to American security, we could now be referring to the post-9/11 experience as 'the bad old days.' Louie Ludwig New Orleans, Aug. 4, 2005","4726":"That is quite a change from four years ago. After the attacks on New York and Washington of Sept. 11, 2001, Saudi Arabia's position as the supplier of choice was threatened. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals, and the man who inspired the attacks, Osama bin Laden, was born in Saudi Arabia; and Saudi funds had financed Taliban schools in Afghanistan. To make matters worse, Saudi intelligence agencies dragged their feet in sharing information with their American counterparts.","4727":"Mr. Aswat, 30, has reportedly boasted that he has ties to Osama bin Laden. He is accused in the United States of working with Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Egyptian-born cleric embroiled in judicial hearings in Britain to determine whether it will approve his extradition to the United States. Like Mr. Aswat, Mr. Masri is accused of involvement in the 1999 plot to establish a training camp in Oregon.","4728":"A search of Mr. Marri's laptop computer also found files containing Arabic lectures by Osama bin Laden and photographs of the Sept. 11 attacks, the government's declaration said.","473":"The focus right now is on Osama bin Laden, no question about it. He's the prime suspect and his organization. But there are other terrorists in the world. There are people who hate freedom.","4731":"The statement was issued by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton after a week in which the Able Danger program, a highly classified operation under the military's Special Operations Command, rose to public prominence. The Sept. 11 commission report made no mention of the unit, disbanded in 2002, and the statement by Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton defended that omission, saying the operation had not been significant 'set against the larger context of U.S. policy and intelligence efforts' that involved Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","4732":"The imam was married to an Italian woman named Barbara, claimed he had met Osama bin Laden and warned that Italian troops in Afghanistan and Iraq would come under justifiable attack. And in November 2003, the imam, Abdel Kader Fadlallah Mamour, was deported to his native Senegal from his home near Turin -- the first time Italy used a law allowing the expulsion of radical imams. An additional seven Muslims termed as extremists were also expelled then, following a crackdown in Italy after an attack in Iraq killed 19 Italian soldiers.","4733":"Philosophically, both groups seemed driven by a reverence for Osama bin Laden.","4734":"At a hearing last week, an F.B.I. agent, Gary Schaaf, accused Mr. Ahmed of planning to set up an Islamic school in Lodi as a front for training recruits to attack Americans. The authorities also suggested that Mr. Ahmed had indirect ties to Osama bin Laden, and said he would be an intermediary between Al Qaeda and its sympathizers in Lodi.","4735":"160 Die in Plane Crash in Venezuela A Colombian airliner carrying French vacationers home from Panama to Martinique crashed in northern Venezuela, killing all 160 people aboard.

Of course, the rise of Osama bin Laden comes clear through his exploits in Afghanistan and Sudan, which apparently included brutal elimination of one rival leader among the Afghan rebels. There's also the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane, an event once dismissed by United States law enforcement as a dead-end dispute between the radical ends of two religions. In fact, the accused gunman, later convicted only of a lesser charge, became an instant icon to the burgeoning legions of anti-Western Muslims.","4738":"Jordanian security has been on alert since the killing of an American diplomat, Laurence M. Foley, in Amman in October 2002. That assassination is suspected to have been directed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a major figure in Iraq's insurgency and an avowed ally of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","4739":"Many Iraqis say the attack outside Balad was probably carried out by Sunni Arabs of the fundamentalist Salafi sect, which counts Osama bin Laden and the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi among its adherents. If so, it might be an indication that the most hard-line Sunnis will increasingly turn on other Sunnis as sectarian divides widen.","474":"The high point of the recovery, whether by coincidence or not, came a few minutes before the first report that President Bush wanted to capture Osama bin Laden, dead or alive. If nothing else, that provided a sobering reminder of the possibility that more rounds of violence may lie ahead.","4741":"Cleave's narrator is a working-class East End woman grieving over the deaths of her husband and young son in a terrorist attack at a soccer match, and the book takes the form of rambling letters to Osama bin Laden. It begins: \"Dear Osama they want you dead or alive so the terror will stop. Well I wouldn't know about that I mean rock 'n' roll didn't stop when Elvis died on the khazi it just got worse.\" This is an audacious, provocative voice -- a bold attempt at impersonation and ventriloquism. Chris Cleave is not, needless to say, a grieving working-class East End woman: he is in fact an Oxford-educated former journalist for The Daily Telegraph, and he lives in Paris.","4742":"From the American standpoint, one argument in favor of conservation and a switch to alternative fuels is that by limiting oil imports, the United States and its Western allies would reduce their dependence on a potentially unstable region. (In fact, in an effort to offset the risks of relying on the Saudis, America's top oil suppliers are Canada and Mexico.) In addition, sending less money to Saudi Arabia would mean less money in the hands of a regime that has spent the past few decades doling out huge amounts of its oil revenue to mosques, madrassas and other institutions that have fanned the fires of Islamic radicalism. The oil money has been dispensed not just by the Saudi royal family but by private individuals who benefited from the oil boom -- like Osama bin Laden, whose ample funds, probably eroded now, came from his father, a construction magnate. Without its oil windfall, Saudi Arabia would have had a hard time financing radical Islamists across the globe.","4743":"All the more tantalizing, then, to discover that the keynote speaker at the private gathering in Langley was identified as \"the C.I.A.'s chief historian.\" Who knew the agency would dare to have such a job? How does he or she perform it? Is the historian free to walk back the cat on the agency's failure to foretell Soviet communism's fall? Or on muffing the gathering threat from Osama bin Laden four years ago? These are questions whose precise answers are usually attempted, or not, in the privacy of closed panels of Congressional overseers. The rest of us had best consult the work of fiction makers like Mr. Littell, who earlier did produce an encyclopedic historical novel titled \"The Company.\" It is filled with as many tales of intramural treacheries as global, further teasing readers who yearn for the truth of spying.","4744":"A group calling itself the Brigades of the Martyr Abdullah Azzam, named after the now-dead spiritual leader of Osama bin Laden, claimed responsibility for the attacks in an Internet posting on Friday; a group by the same name also took responsibility for multiple suicide bombings in Egypt, in Sharm el Sheikh in June and in Taba last year. But most security officials discounted the posting.","4745":"Mr. Zarqawi is a crucial figure in the insurgency in Iraq and the second-most-wanted terrorist on Washington's list after Osama bin Laden.","4746":"One earlier draft of the inspector general's report criticized the management of the Counterterrorist Center and the Directorate of Operations for focusing on Al Qaeda's leadership, rather than looking for ways to attack the terrorist network at lower levels, according to a former senior agency official who read the draft. The former official said that by focusing on going after Osama bin Laden, the agency missed opportunities to recruit low-level agents on the margins of Al Qaeda who might have eventually provided access to its inner workings.","4747":"But the perpetrators of the 1993 bombing were found and are in prison, whereas the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, was allowed to slip through our fingers in Afghanistan.

Plus: Why wasn't he captured at Tora Bora, and why can't he be caught now? A special 9/11 issue. MAGAZINE","4761":"This is not idle anxiety. In his book \"Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory,\" which relied heavily on research obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Michael Christopher Carroll wrote that in a 2002 raid of the Kabul, Afghanistan, residence of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a nuclear physicist who American officials have identified as an associate of Osama bin Laden, C.I.A. operatives and Army commandos found a \"dossier\" containing \"information on a place in New York called the Plum Island Animal Disease Center.\"","4763":"As for the \"terrorist groups of global reach,\" Al Qaeda, according to the president, has been severely wounded. \"We've captured or killed two-thirds of their known leaders,\" he said last year. And yet however degraded Al Qaeda's operational capacity, nearly every other month, it seems, Osama bin Laden or one of his henchmen appears on the world's television screens to expatiate on the ideology and strategy of global jihad and to urge followers on to more audacious and more lethal efforts. This, and the sheer number and breadth of terrorist attacks, suggest strongly that Al Qaeda has now become Al Qaedaism -- that under the American and allied assault, what had been a relatively small, conspiratorial organization has mutated into a worldwide political movement, with thousands of followers eager to adopt its methods and advance its aims. Call it viral Al Qaeda, carried by strongly motivated next-generation followers who download from the Internet's virtual training camp a perfectly adequate trade-craft in terror. Nearly two years ago, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, in a confidential memorandum, posed the central question about the war on terror: \"Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?\" The answer is clearly no. \"We have taken a ball of quicksilver,\" says the counterinsurgency specialist John Arquilla, \"and hit it with a hammer.\"","4764":"Three-quarters of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis? It's a plot of Osama bin Laden's to discredit the Saudis.","4765":"Well past midnight one morning in early December 2001, according to American intelligence officials, Osama bin Laden sat with a group of top aides -- including members of his elite international 055 Brigade -- in the mountainous redoubt of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan. Outside, it was blustery and bitterly cold; many of the passes of the White Mountains, of which Tora Bora forms a part, were already blocked by snow. But inside the cave complex, where bin Laden had sought his final refuge from the American war in Afghanistan -- a war in which Washington, that October, had struck back for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- bin Laden munched on olives and sipped sugary mint tea. He was dressed in his signature camouflage jacket, and a Kalashnikov rested by his side. Captured Qaeda fighters, interviewed separately, told American interrogators that they recalled an address that bin Laden had made to his followers shortly before dawn. It concerned martyrdom. American bombs, including a 15,000-pound \"daisy cutter,\" were raining from the sky and pulverizing a number of the Tora Bora caves. And yet, one American intelligence official told me recently, if any one thing distinguished Osama bin Laden on that cold December day, it was the fact that the 44-year-old Saudi multimillionaire appeared to be supremely confident.","4766":"A strong offense. All agree that by rousting Osama bin Laden from his Afghanistan base, and detaining or killing many top aides, the United States disrupted Al Qaeda, which had grown so strong in the 1990's.","4767":"Judge Roberts is also certain to be asked about Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a case he participated in on the appeals court. The ruling, handed down on July 15, turned back a challenge to the military commissions that the Bush administration intends to use to try several of those being held as enemy combatants at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay naval base. Lawyers for Salim Ahmed Hamdan, described as a bodyguard and driver for Osama bin Laden when he was captured in Afghanistan in 2001, have appealed the case to the Supreme Court. But if Judge Roberts is confirmed to the court, he will be recused from the case.","4768":"He said it was possible that Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, is still moving between remote parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan four years after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. 'I will not negate entirely, with confidence, that he is not there,' he said. 'But I will never accept anybody who says with confidence that he is there.' He said later that he often asks, 'Do you have intelligence, have you heard him?'","477":"Still, there were some signs that consumers were moving past the tragedy, at least in their appetite for information. Two weeks ago, Web surfers frequently typed in words like 'shark attack' and 'Anne Heche' on Google.com, an Internet search engine. Then, the twin towers collapsed, and the most popular topics suddenly became Nostradamus, World Trade Center and Osama bin Laden. Now, Google.com executives say the mainstays of many Internet search engines have started to reappear in the thin white windows that take surfers where they want to go: to sex and mp3 sites.","4770":"Much of the material now restored in the public version of the commission's report centered on the warnings the F.A.A. received about the threat of hijackings, including 52 intelligence documents in the months before the Sept. 11 attacks that mentioned Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden.","4772":"As persecution continued across the Arab world, the neo-fundamentalist rhetoric became more Manichean and xenophobic. With mainstream opponents silenced, ultraradicals became the loudest voices of dissent. In Egypt, for example, those who emerged from prison in the 1970's formed militant organizations, including Al Jihad, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is now chief lieutenant for Osama bin Laden. These men were not thinkers or theologians; rather, many were disillusioned Westernized professionals, former leftists and nationalists.","4773":"A Jordanian with a background as humble as Osama bin Laden's is grand, Ahmad Fadil Nazzal al-Khalayleh (Zarqawi's nom de guerre is taken from his hometown near Amman) traveled a route sharply different from that of Al Qaeda's first generation of leaders. Unlike the patrician surgeon Ayman al-Zawahiri, the group's second-in-command and chief ideologist, or bin Laden himself, a member of the Saudi elite who studied engineering and economics, Zarqawi was a high school dropout, an abuser of alcohol, a drug dealer and possibly a participant in an attempted rape.","4774":"So let's give Mr. Musharraf a free-trade deal -- but only on the condition that he clamp down not on Pakistani women fighting against rape, but on Osama bin Laden.","4775":"There is a general sense now that things are falling apart.

Mr. Tenet and others named in the document objected to that conclusion, and prepared rebuttals that the C.I.A. has shared with Congress.","4783":"The period right after 9/11, for all its pain, was the high point of the Bush presidency. Four years ago, we hung on every word when Mr. Bush denounced Al Qaeda and made the emotional -- but, as it turned out, empty -- vow to track down Osama bin Laden. Yesterday, it seemed as if the president was still trying to live in 2001. It was eerie to hear him urge Americans to take terrorism seriously. There wasn't any reason to worry about that even before subway riders were being told about the threat of a terrorist attack on their commute home.","4784":"Mr. Zawahiri is considered second only to Osama bin Laden in Al Qaeda's hierarchy, but the letter makes no mention of Mr. bin Laden, who is believed to be hiding in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.","4785":"In an unusual move, Mr. Bush named Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, five times in his speech, and quoted Mr. bin Laden's own statements to support the president's argument that terror groups inspired by Al Qaeda were trying to \"enslave whole nations and intimidate the world,\" starting in Iraq.","4786":"The reward for a tip that could help kill or capture Dulmatin, an Indonesian militant believed to be hiding in the Philippines, is exceeded only by the $25 million offered for Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.","4787":"The logic of supporting both a moratorium and a death penalty in justifiable cases also came under scrutiny yesterday during a taping of an interview with Mr. Ferrer that will be broadcast tomorrow on the CBS news show \"Kirtzman &amp; Company.\" In the interview, Mr. Ferrer said he would make an exception in the moratorium for Osama bin Laden, and perhaps for terrorists broadly, although the precise scope of the exception was not clear.","4788":"Beware of leaders who drink their own Kool-Aid. The most distressing aspect of Mr. Bush's press conference last week was less his lies and half-truths than the abundant evidence that he is as out of touch as Custer was on the way to Little Bighorn. The president seemed genuinely shocked that anyone could doubt his claim that his friend is the best-qualified candidate for the highest court. Mr. Bush also seemed unaware that it was Republicans who were leading the attack on Ms. Miers. \"The decision as to whether or not there will be a fight is up to the Democrats,\" he said, confusing his antagonists this time much as he has Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.","4789":"\"We'll hunt him down and kill him, same as Osama bin Laden.\"","479":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 17\u2014 Afghanistan rebuffed an American demand relayed today by Pakistan that the Taliban government immediately and unconditionally surrender Osama bin Laden to head off a military showdown, but Afghan leaders set a high-level meeting for Tuesday to make a final decision.","4790":"I noted here last year that much of the badness has been leached out of the phrase bad guys, which is often followed with a 'but,' as a State Department spokesman's recent explanation of failure to go after Osama bin Laden in the 90's: 'Yes he was a bad guy, but he was one of many.. . .' In a recent review of a film made from a gripping John Le Carr?ovel, The Wall Street Journal headlined: 'A Tale of Global Bad Guys, 'Constant Gardener' Putters, But It Doesn't Dig Deep.' A bad guy is no longer simply the opposite of 'good guy'; the ensuing but signals the vitiation of the villainous sting of depravity. No longer do we have scoundrel, malefactor, blackguard, monster or Hamlet's 'Bloody, bawdy. . .remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!'; we have merely the bad guy, but -- just another type of the familiar guy.","4791":"The announcement came only hours after President Bush spoke to the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and after he held an unusual Sunday afternoon meeting in the Oval Office with a Pakistani diplomat. The speed, a senior administration official said, reflected the estimates of the death toll and the American desire to bolster General Musharraf when his help is badly needed in finding Osama bin Laden and repressing Islamic radicals.","4792":"[On the CNN program \"Late Edition\" on Oct. 9, Mr. Robertson was back on the attack, citing unidentified sources who accused Mr. Ch\u00e1vez of sending \"either $1 million or $1.2 million in cash\" to Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 attacks and asserting that Venezuela was trying to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity. The Venezuelan vice president, Jos\u00e9 Vicente Rangel, dismissed Mr. Robertson's remarks, saying, \"He's crazy, at the very least.\"]","4793":"The letter alluded to difficulties facing Al Qaeda's leaders, including what Mr. Zawahiri calls \"the real danger\" posed by the Pakistani military in its searches for militants in northwestern Pakistan, near the Afghan border, where Mr. Zawahiri and Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, are believed to be hiding.","4794":"Osama bin Laden must be thrilled at the way we have managed to antagonize our traditional friends and give comfort to our enemies.","4795":"After an extensive debate inside the White House, Mr. Bush has begun directly rebutting the arguments laid out in manifestos and missives from Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mr. bin Laden's top aide.","4796":"\"South Park\" has evolved from a cranky, obscene voice of 1990's slacker culture to a high-profile entertainment brand, in large part because it provides a continuous running commentary on current events. Eight years of tackling up-to-the-minute issues like the search for Osama bin Laden, the controversy over Mel Gibson's \"Passion of the Christ\" and the right-to-die questions raised by the court battle over Terri Schiavo have elevated Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone to a position as opinion arbiters: viewers count on divisive, newsworthy topics getting the \"South Park\" treatment.","4797":"Speaking at a news conference, the official, Henry A. Crumpton, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, was peppered with questions by Indonesians about why the United States has not given Indonesian authorities access to Riduan Isamuddin, better known as Hambali, a senior lieutenant of Osama bin Laden who was captured by the C.I.A. in Bangkok in August 2003.","4798":"American officials have acknowledged over the years that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980's. But Washington still has not ruled out the possibility that El Shifa did, in fact, have some link to chemical weapons production.","4799":"\"I've tried a lot of cases, and he's probably the toughest adversary I've ever seen,\" said Roger L. Stavis, a New York defense lawyer who faced Mr. Fitzgerald during the 1995 terrorism trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman. Mr. Stavis prided himself on knowing the web of Muslim extremists but was surprised when Mr. Fitzgerald asked a witness about Osama bin Laden, then an obscure figure.","48":"But it says that Afghanistan also poses a 'major terrorist threat' by, among other things, continuing to shelter the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa, as well as other Afghan-trained Islamic militants sought by the administration.","480":"Terry F. Lenzner, chairman of Investigative Group International, a corporate security concern, said increased surveillance of the flow of money might have prevented the attacks by identifying people who had received money from Osama bin Laden or other terrorists.","4800":"But there were unspoken impediments to Mr. Rove's plan that he certainly knew about: Afghanistan was slipping off the radar screen of American voters, and the president's most grandiose objective, to capture Osama bin Laden \"dead or alive,\" had not been achieved. How do you run on a war if the war looks as if it's shifting into neutral and the No.1 evildoer has escaped?","4801":"'Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden,' to be published next month, was edited by Bruce Lawrence, a professor of religion at Duke University. It is the first book to offer in English a broad selection of Mr. bin Laden's writings and statements. The following is from 'To the Peoples of Europe,' a message broadcast on Arab television about one month after the March 11, 2004, bombings in Madrid.","4802":"A second behavioral change is our visa policy, which is seen around the world as unfriendly, unwelcoming and downright arrogant. Business leaders can say to the government, \"This is really hurting us and we need to have a friendlier, more welcoming visa policy.\" We should encourage people to come. For example, we're working with a group called Young Arab Leaders that has identified 500 Arab and Muslim youth who we think should be brought into the United States and into U.S. companies. Think of it as the Fulbright for the private sector. Let's out-recruit Osama bin Laden.","4803":"Mr. Mohammad was also accused of using drug profits to support terrorism and the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist party that ruled Afghanistan for years and was allied with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. While the Taliban was ousted by American troops in 2001, it has remained a force in large areas of Afghanistan, especially along the eastern border with Pakistan, and the drug money bought its protection for poppy crops, heroin laboratories, shipments and conspirators, the federal officials said.","4804":"'Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Al Qaeda have a partner in Al Jazeera and, by extension, most networks in the U.S.,' Mr. Smith wrote. 'This partnership is a powerful tool for the terrorists in the war in Iraq.'","4805":"An excerpt in the Reading File column last Sunday from 'Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden,' a book edited by Bruce Lawrence (Verso) to be published next month, characterized it incorrectly. It is not the first such work: 'Osama bin Laden: America's Enemy in His Own Words,' edited by Randall B. Hamud (Nadeem), was published in August.","4806":"Three police officials testified, including David Cohen, the deputy police commissioner for intelligence, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency from 1966 to 2000. He was the agency's deputy director for operations, overseeing clandestine work, from 1995 to 1997, and helped create a unit dedicated to finding Osama bin Laden.","4807":"Omar al-Faruq, a confidant of Osama bin Laden who was one of Al Qaeda's senior operatives in Southeast Asia, escaped from an American military prison in Afghanistan in July, a Pentagon official said Wednesday.","4808":"INTERNATIONAL A3-13 In Reversal, Iraqi Army Recruits Hussein's Officers The Iraqi government called for the return of junior officers from the disbanded army of Saddam Hussein, reversing an American directive issued in 2003. The move is aimed at draining the insurgency of recruits and bolstering the Iraqi security forces, Iraqi officials said. A1 Qaeda Member Escaped in July Omar al-Faruq, a confidant of Osama bin Laden who was one of Al Qaeda's senior operatives in Southeast Asia, escaped from an American military prison in Afghanistan in July, a Pentagon official said. He remains at large. A12 Syria Faces Difficult Decision The Syrian government is in a tight spot as Asef Shawkat, the powerful brother-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad, has been implicated in a United Nations investigation into the killing of a former Lebanese prime minister. If Mr. Assad turns over Mr. Shawkat for questioning, many Syrians and diplomats say, the intelligence services could find themselves in chaos and the president could lose some of his grip on power by fracturing the unity of the family.

B1 New Runway Safety System The Federal Aviation Administration said it would install all-weather aircraft detection systems at 14 busy airports, including the 3 biggest in the New York area. The decision follows a series of near-catastrophes on runways, including one this summer in which the controllers' radar system was blinded by rain. B3 Judge Criticizes U.S. Agency A federal judge in Manhattan said the United States Marshals Service had suppressed evidence in the trial of a man convicted of terrorism charges in 2001, and then tried to cover up its actions.

Bridge E10 TV Listings E11 Crossword E4 Weather C20","4809":"A federal judge in Manhattan refused yesterday to overturn the 2001 convictions of a former aide to Osama bin Laden in a major terrorism case, but he sharply criticized the United States Marshals Service for suppressing evidence and then trying to hide what it had done.","481":"Perhaps even more than Muslims, Sikhs in the United States have been singled out for harassment since the terrorist attacks, perhaps because the long beards and turbans prescribed by their Indian religion give them a visual resemblance to the terrorist Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.","4810":"TODAY the Supreme Court justices are expected to debate whether they will hear a case involving a Yemeni named Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who is accused of being Osama bin Laden's driver. A federal appeals court found that Mr. Hamdan, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and is being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba, was not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions; he has appealed to the high court.","4811":"The only way that the Bush administration could persuade Americans to pursue our failed policy was by trumpeting false evidence linking Iraq to nuclear weapons and the still-unaccounted-for Osama bin Laden.","4812":"Like the C.I.A. officer Michael Scheuer, the author (under the pseudonym \"Anonymous\") of the 2004 book \"Imperial Hubris,\" Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Simon regard the American invasion of Iraq as a kind of Christmas present to Osama bin Laden: an unnecessary and ill-judged war of choice that has not only become a recruitment tool for jihadis but that has also affirmed the story line that Al Qaeda leaders have been telling the Muslim world -- that America is waging war against Islam and seeking to occupy oil-rich Muslim countries.","4813":"If there's a tragic example that can serve as representative of the rest, it is surely that of Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinals defensive back who famously volunteered for the Army in the spring after 9/11, giving up a $3.6 million N.F.L. contract extension. Tillman wanted to pay something back to his country by pursuing the enemy that actually attacked it, Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Instead he was sent to fight a war in Iraq that he didn't see coming when he enlisted because the administration was still hatching it in secret. Only on a second tour of duty was he finally sent into Taliban strongholds in Afghanistan, where, on April 22, 2004, he was killed. On April 30, an official Army press release announcing his Silver Star citation filled in vivid details of his last battle. Tillman, it said, was storming a hill to take out the enemy, even as he \"personally provided suppressive fire with an M-249 Squad Automatic Weapon machine gun.\"","4814":"Arriving at the bureau in the wake of the twin debacles at Waco and Ruby Ridge, Freeh served an eventful tenure, matching wits with everyone from the Unabomber to Timothy McVeigh and Osama bin Laden. He expanded the bureau's presence overseas, and did his best to improve morale. By and large, the F.B.I. is staffed by men and women who, like Freeh, are earnest, capable and underpaid. Their successes are generally ignored, their failures endlessly explored. As Freeh points out, the bureau cannot work miracles. New York City employs 44,000 people to police its streets. The F.B.I. has 12,000 agents to police the entire country.","4815":"The charges against Mr. Khadr say that his father was a close friend of Osama bin Laden and that he, too, was acquainted with Mr. bin Laden, the Qaeda leader.","4816":"Mr. Hamdan, described by the government as Osama bin Laden's former bodyguard and driver, is charged with conspiracy, murder and terrorism. He was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and since 2002 had been held at Guant\u00e1namo. He is now one of a dozen detainees, out of the more than 500 still held there, who have been designated by President Bush as eligible for trial before military commissions.","4817":"Officials said they were working on the theory that the suspects represented another example of a homegrown terrorist network inspired perhaps by Osama bin Laden, but not directed from the outside. The men downloaded bomb-making instructions from the Internet, a prosecutor told a court in Melbourne.","4818":"Ms. Miller leaves the paper after serving for many years as an investigative and national security correspondent. She has written four books and in 2002 was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism for reporting, before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, about the growing threat of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","4819":"After 9/11, everyone knew there was going to be a debate about the future of Islam. We just didn't know the debate would be between Osama bin Laden and Tupac Shakur.","482":"If the United States is to win the war against terrorism, it must really win two major battles. The first is to capture or eliminate terrorist organizations like Osama bin Laden's. The second is to eliminate the terrorists' base of support by convincing the desperate people in the Muslim world that the United States is a positive ally, not a Great Satan.","4821":"Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups now operate with impunity around the world, spreading death and destruction where and when they choose. Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi are both still at large.","4822":"The power of these lies was considerable. In a CBS News/New York Times poll released on Sept. 25, 2001, 60 percent of Americans thought Osama bin Laden had been the culprit in the attacks of two weeks earlier, either alone or in league with unnamed \"others\" or with the Taliban; only 6 percent thought bin Laden had collaborated with Saddam; and only 2 percent thought Saddam had been the sole instigator. By the time we invaded Iraq in 2003, however, CBS News found that 53 percent believed Saddam had been \"personally involved\" in 9/11; other polls showed that a similar percentage of Americans had even convinced themselves that the hijackers were Iraqis.","4823":"Similar pages track Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose savvy use of the news media makes them natural open-source targets. Even as Mr. Zarqawi, leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, has eluded capture, his group has issued daily Web reports on its attacks, often with video. Some of the posted information, albeit unvetted, would be a coup for any secret agent. On Friday, for instance, a Web communiqu\u00e9 described in detail the hotel bombings in Jordan, giving the nationality, gender and noms de guerre of the attackers.","4824":"Osama bin Laden is still on the loose, Afghanistan remains the world's top heroin producer, and Iraq has become a major training ground for terrorists. Larry Edwards San Diego, Calif., Nov. 12, 2005","4825":"Among the dozen files Mr. Ahmed apparently monitored in one predawn session in March 2004, for example, were video of battles in Chechnya and speeches by Osama bin Laden. One audio file attacked Jews and Christians and all who collaborate with them, another invited followers to wage holy war against infidels who follow the \"laws of the devil.\"","4826":"Robert Fisk is probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain. Based in Beirut for the past three decades, he rode with Soviet troops invading Afghanistan in 1980, chronicled the prison tortures of Saddam Hussein and Ayatollah Khomeini in the early 1980's, recorded the butchery in Algeria in the 1990's and interviewed Osama bin Laden three times, starting in 1993 when few Westerners knew the name. First for The Times of London and since 1989 for The Independent, Mr. Fisk, a writer of exceptional power, has brought readers deep inside the Muslim Middle East, laying bare its humiliation and suffering.","4827":"But while the war is lost both as a political matter at home and a practical matter in Iraq, the exit strategy being haggled over in Washington will hardly mark the end of our woes. Few Americans will cry over the collapse of the administration's vainglorious mission to make Iraq a model of neocon nation-building. But, as some may dimly recall, there is another war going on as well -- against Osama bin Laden and company.","4828":"After Sept. 11, Fick was ready to put his training into action. He felt grateful and honored to be sent to Afghanistan, but the war turned out to be a dud. Fick and his men spent much of their time on watch at a secure military air base. They were prepared to search the Tora Bora caves for Osama bin Laden, but the call never came. When Fick's mentor, a maverick captain with a taste for ancient war manuals, suggested he try out for reconnaissance, he jumped at the chance. \"Every marine thinks he's the toughest guy in the room,\" Fick writes. \"Most will agree, though, that the toughest unit in the corps is recon.\"","4829":"Publicly, Thomas A. Shannon, Noriega's successor, has taken a more low-key approach. But the Bush administration's view of Morales does not appear to have changed significantly. Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington, and one of the shrewdest and most experienced American observers of Latin America, told me that he has been struck by the depth of conviction in Washington that Morales is dangerous. \"People talk about him as if he were the Osama bin Laden of Latin America,\" Shifter told me, adding that, after a recent lecture Shifter gave at a military institution, two American officers came up to him and said that Morales \"was a terrorist, a murderer, the worst thing ever.\" Shifter replied that he had seen no evidence of this. \"They told me: 'You should. We have classified information: this guy is the worst thing to happen in Latin America in a long time.\"' In Shifter's view, there is now a tremendous sense of hysteria about Morales within the administration and especially at the Pentagon.","483":"Osama bin Laden","4830":"The defendant, Uzair Paracha, knew that his countryman was a Qaeda operative because his father had told him so, said the prosecutor, Karl Metzner. Mr. Paracha's father had been a business associate of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and had met with Osama bin Laden there, Mr. Metzner said.","4831":"This was the Sudan that was home to Osama bin Laden before he sought refuge in Afghanistan. In fact, as Mr. Iseli strolled the carpeted halls of his hotel here, he recalled how the sound of gunfire interrupted a party he attended in 1993 at a diplomat's house in Sudan. A few days later he learned that the shootout had occurred between Mr. bin Laden and the authorities.","4832":"The jurors evidently gave no credence to Mr. Paracha's claims that he did not know Mr. Khan was a Qaeda member. In extensive confessions he made during three days of questioning by New York counterterrorism agents before he was arrested, Mr. Paracha admitted that his father, Saifullah Paracha, had told him of Mr. Khan's terror ties. Mr. Paracha testified in court that his father \"admired\" Osama bin Laden, after a meeting with the Qaeda leader in Afghanistan. The elder Mr. Paracha is in military detention in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.","4833":"And \"what about a Wall Street Journal reporter, working in Afghanistan, who knows the exact location of Osama bin Laden but does not reveal it to the United States government in order to protect her source?\"","4834":"General Qader, the Kirkuk police commander, said the raids that uncovered the plot to kill Mr. Juhi had also found three car bombs ready to be driven to targets, as well as other documents linking the men seized in the raids to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the deputy to Osama bin Laden. He said the document ordering Mr. Juhi's assassination was signed with a pseudonym, \"Sheik of the Mujahedeen,\" and that the captured men, one of them a former secret police officer under Mr. Hussein, had said that that was the title used by Mr. Ibrahim.","4835":"Eric Schenk, Mill Valley, Calif.: There are amazing Americans in Iraq doing heroic things. But, as you know, the administration has attempted to make this a war of slogans without any reality \u2014 no meaningful sacrifices by the American people at large, paying for the war on our American Express card. Additionally, more Americans see this as another folly and there are no heroes in the case of misadventures. Thank you, nonetheless, for a reminder about the actual individuals who are trying to make a difference in Iraq. It makes me sad to say that their lives have unnecessarily been put at risk. Certainly, had we stayed the course in Afghanistan and captured or killed Osama bin Laden, there would have been something to truly celebrate. It appears less and less like we have a competent driver in the vehicle attempting to stay the course in Iraq. We owe Christoper Ieva and his fellow soldiers more respect for their efforts and their lives.","4836":"The Human Rights Watch list includes Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, arrested in Pakistan in 2003 and suspected of being a top operative in Al Qaeda behind the Sept. 11 attacks; and Hassan Ghul, alleged to have been a courier for Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant in Iraq.","4837":"One result is ticks and Lyme disease, but deer also kill people more directly. A study for the insurance industry estimated that deer kill about 150 people a year in car crashes nationwide and cause $1 billion in damage. Granted, deer aren't stalking us, and they come out worse in these collisions -- but it's still true that in a typical year, an American is less likely to be killed by Osama bin Laden than by Bambi.","4838":"By some measures, the American official said, Mr. Hamza, an Egyptian in his 30's, ranked behind only Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in the terror network's hierarchy. He took on the top operational role this summer after the capture of his superior, Farraj al-Libi, the official said.","4839":"Commander Swift represents the detainee, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni whom the government describes as having been as a driver for Osama bin Laden.","484":"'When I speak against the Taliban and Osama, they harass me; so many times they harass me,' Imam Mohammed Sherzad, the leader of Hazrat-I-Abubakr Sadiq mosque, said at his office in Flushing, Queens. 'They say: 'Why do you speak against Osama bin Laden? He is a good Muslim.' '","4840":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 - More than three years before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, American diplomats warned Saudi officials that Osama bin Laden might target civilian aircraft, according to a newly declassified State Department cable.","4841":"To that end, among the sketches under consideration earlier this week -- there are typically 40 in all, which will ultimately be winnowed to 8 before show time -- were these: a takeoff on \"Brokeback Mountain\" (the working title was \"Brokeback Goldmine\") in which Mr. Baldwin would play an old, gay prospector; a spoof of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, in which he would play a father who gets fired as his child looks on; and a reprise of his dead-on Tony Bennett, who would interview Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden or maybe Dick Cheney.","4842":"When it draws closer to the present, however, and when it insists most strenuously on its central conceit, \"The Power of Nightmares\" can feel awfully tendentious. At times Mr. Curtis seems to believe too literally in the notion that neoconservatism and radical Islam are mirror images of each other, creating odd impressions of equivalence and fudging over problems of definition. The second of the three parts, for instance, covers the post-cold-war confusion of the 1990's, when both radical Islam and American conservatism seemed to be losing ground after joining together to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan. On one side, the result was the ongoing slaughter in Algeria; on the other, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, who is said to serve the right as a transitional demon between Communism and Osama bin Laden. The incommensurability of these two events seems obvious enough -- whatever you think of Kenneth Starr, he never slit anyone's throat -- but Mr. Curtis's rhetorical and visual sleights of hand manage to obscure it.","4843":"He has already written a book about Lebanon, where he lives. Now comes \"The Great War for Civilisation,\" his Big Book (and how) and his testament. A vast overview of the region, it makes use of every clipping and notebook he has ever kept and runs in no particular order, chronological or otherwise, from his meetings with Osama bin Laden (\"my first impression was of a shy man\") to the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the Iraq-Iran war, both of which he covered.","4844":"So now, Mr. Cheney and others warn, Al Qaeda's ultimate goal is the re-establishment of the caliphate, with calamitous consequences for the United States. As Mr. Cheney put it in Lake Elmo, referring to Osama bin Laden and his followers: \"They talk about wanting to re-establish what you could refer to as the seventh-century caliphate\" to be \"governed by Sharia law, the most rigid interpretation of the Koran.\"","4845":"Several officials said the eavesdropping program had helped uncover a plot by Iyman Faris, an Ohio trucker and naturalized citizen who pleaded guilty in 2003 to supporting Al Qaeda by planning to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge with blowtorches. What appeared to be another Qaeda plot, involving fertilizer bomb attacks on British pubs and train stations, was exposed last year in part through the program, the officials said. But they said most people targeted for N.S.A. monitoring have never been charged with a crime, including an Iranian-American doctor in the South who came under suspicion because of what one official described as dubious ties to Osama bin Laden.","4846":"Several officials said the eavesdropping program had helped uncover a plot by Iyman Faris, an Ohio trucker and naturalized citizen who pleaded guilty in 2003 to supporting Al Qaeda by planning to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge with blowtorches.

That war isn't over either. Although President Hamid Karzai's government can claim a number of noteworthy successes, much remains uncertain. Tribal warlords still control many regions. American troops are unable to travel safely in much of the country; more than 200 soldiers have died there since the fall of the Taliban. Despite the extradition of the major Taliban drug lord Baz Mohammad to the United States this fall, poppy production has increased wildly since the American invasion, to the point that Afghanistan is now responsible for nearly 90 percent of the world's supply of opium. Turnout for the country's recent parliamentary election was 20 percent lower than for last year's presidential election, and the announcement of the results was delayed because of widespread complaints about voter intimidation, ballot box stuffing and fraud. And it's widely believed Osama bin Laden is still hiding in the mountainous region that forms the ambiguous, and unmonitored, border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.","4848":"Most of Tsundue's friends and colleagues were born and educated in India and had traveled to Dharamsala from across the country in order to work full time for Tibetan freedom. Others had arrived recently from Tibet after a hard journey over the Himalayas. A true Buddhist is expected to bear with equanimity the prospect of an endless exile, but Tsundue's friends spoke approvingly of violence as a possible means to Tibetan freedom. One talked of the \"many Chinese embassies in the world that could be targets,\" naming possible sites with disturbing precision. Another interjected: \"Look at Palestine and Israel. Such small places compared to Tibet, but the world pays them so much attention because of the Intifada, the suicide bombers and Osama bin Laden. What has nonviolence achieved for the Tibetan cause, apart from some converts to Buddhism in the West?\" The passionate voices of the Tibetans echoed in the small cafe. But they knew, and it was easy to see, that violence does not come easily to a Buddhist. Walking up a steep mountain path earlier that evening, I saw one of Tsundue's friends stop to pick up an ant and place it gently to one side, out of harm's way.","4849":"But after the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan succeeded in overthrowing the Taliban government in late 2001, Al Qaeda lost its sanctuary, and Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders scattered to Pakistan, Iran and other countries. As counterterrorism operations grew, the Bush administration wanted the security agency secretly to expand its surveillance as well. By 2002, Mr. Bush gave the agency broader surveillance authority.","485":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 18\u2014 In the last seven days, Americans have watched their president move from the quiet language of grief to the rowdy colloquialisms of the old frontier: The United States wants Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.' The country will go after those 'folks' if it has to 'smoke them out and get them running.' And they are 'evil-doers, those barbaric people.'","4850":"Clarke, a counterterrorism adviser to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, is also the author of the best-selling \"Against All Enemies,\" a trenchant indictment of the Bush White House for failing to take seriously repeated warnings about Al Qaeda's intentions to attack the United States and for the folly of going after Iraq rather than concentrating on Osama bin Laden. The man certainly knows his terrorism, but he's not going to be confused with Henry James. To be fair, none of the popular techno-thriller writers will be either, and that hasn't put a crimp in anyone's sales. If their readers wanted Henry James, they'd read \"The Princess Casamassima.\" What they're after is suspense, a fast pace and, most of all, the illusion they're getting a glimpse of how things work in the clandestine inner circles of power. Clarke's book delivers on all these scores. And in his case, the insiderness is no illusion.","4851":"Mr. Bush and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales offered a whole bag of logical pretzels yesterday to justify flouting this law. Most bizarre was the assertion that Congress authorized the surveillance of American citizens when it approved the use of \"all necessary and appropriate force\" by the United States military to punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks or who aided or harbored the terrorists. This came as a surprise to lawmakers, who thought they were voting for the invasion of Afghanistan and the capture of Osama bin Laden.","4852":"Mr. Bush -- who initially resisted a public investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks and the intelligence failures in Iraq -- used his news conference Monday to discourage Congress from publicly delving into the program, saying that \"public hearings on programs will say to the enemy, 'Here's what they do, adjust.' \" He repeatedly cited the case of Osama bin Laden, who was widely reported to have stopped using a satellite telephone after news reports that intelligence agencies were listening in.","4853":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 - As an example of the damage caused by unauthorized disclosures to reporters, President Bush said at his news conference on Monday that Osama bin Laden had been tipped by a leak that the United States was tracking his location through his telephone. After this information was published, Mr. Bush said, Mr. bin Laden stopped using the phone.","4854":"In the real world -- and the United States exists in the real world, despite a national weakness for wishful thinking -- failure has consequences. The prospects for American success in Iraq, which do not look promising, are the consequence of a cascading series of previous, all-too-familiar failures -- the failure to heed intelligence warnings before 9/11, the failure to press the hunt for Osama bin Laden until he was caught, the failure to think twice before invading Iraq, the failure to send enough troops to establish security once the Iraqi Army quit fighting, the failure to recognize the growing insurgency until it was too big to crush, the failure to begin building an Iraqi Army and police services in a timely manner, the failure to foresee that a war in Iraq would draw jihadists from every corner of the Islamic world. . . .","4855":"In the consulate, Christian employees had hung pictures of the Coptic pope and various saints over their cubicles. The closest any got to pictures of supporters of Hamas were pictures of Osama bin Laden and other terrorists in the F.B.I. list of most wanted terrorists.","4856":"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED -- Why is Osama bin Laden still at large more than four years after 9/11? The new C.I.A. director, Porter J. Goss, provided a big hint. He said that the United States had a good idea of where Mr. bin Laden was hiding, but that sovereign states would not let a proper manhunt be mounted. Mr. Goss's statement seemed to confirm the widespread suspicion that Mr. bin Laden was hiding in the mountains of northern Pakistan but that President Pervez Musharraf, fearing the reaction of Islamic militants, was not eager for him to be captured. Mr. Musharraf himself lent support to that theory, telling an interviewer: \"One would prefer that he's captured somewhere outside Pakistan. By some other people.\"","4859":"After summarizing the nearly unanimous critical drubbing Grey's novels received, partly because of passages like these, Pauly goes on the offensive. He writes: \"Contrary to the negative assessments of these critics, Grey was, in fact, a skillful writer who combined easy readability with artful embellishment.\" No, he wasn't. Grey was a profoundly bad writer who combined mawkish sentimentality with geographic fabulism. (Exception: Grey's fishing essays are largely devoid of the pinched overexertion of his fiction, and are actually quite excellent.) But bad writing hardly disqualifies an author from our interest, an axiom we might call the Harriet Beecher Stowe Principle. By the thunderous force of his popularity and the potency of his mythologies, Grey had a deep and pervasive effect on the way America saw itself, and he was a crucial - perhaps the crucial - figure in the romanticization of the West that has yet to loose its grip on the nation. When George W. Bush struck a cowboy pose in 2001, vowing to capture Osama bin Laden \"dead or alive,\" he was aping an archetype that came straight from Grey's imagination. That Grey was a far more complex figure than previously thought, therefore, warrants some attention. America is never as simple as it longs to be.","486":"Critical to the administration's planning, therefore, are economic, political, diplomatic and intelligence measures, as well as possible ground forces, all of which would deprive Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant suspected of masterminding the attacks on Sept. 11, of his sanctuary -- or as Mr. Rumsfeld put it today, 'drain the swamp they live in.'","4860":"Specifically, Ms. Mauskopf said prosecutors had used the law, which broadens federal powers to demand financial records, to convict the spiritual adviser to Osama bin Laden, Sheik Muhammad Ali Hassan al-Mouyad, as well as Sheik Mouyad's assistant, for funneling millions of dollars to Al Qaeda and the militant group Hamas.","4861":"At loose ends, one of the jihadis suggested that they go see a man named Osama bin Laden, a well-known sheik among radical Islamists who led a militant group of itinerant Muslim holy warriors called Al Qaeda. Having only recently been expelled from Sudan, bin Laden had relocated to Afghanistan, where he planned to rebuild Al Qaeda with the help of his new hosts, the Taliban. Bin Laden earned his reputation during the anti-Soviet campaign in Afghanistan in the 1980's, but he was now enlisting soldiers for his new crusade to drive the United States from the Arabian Peninsula.","4862":"Lawyers for Mr. Hamdan, once a bodyguard and driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, are arguing that the president lacked explicit and inherent authority to establish the military commissions. They also say the commissions' procedures fail to give defendants the protections to which civilian, military and international law entitle them.","4863":"Prosecutors say that Mr. Bahlul, one of the first prisoners to arrive at the Guant\u00e1namo center when it was set up in 2002, attended a Qaeda training camp and was a bodyguard to Osama bin Laden in 2001. Earlier, he had produced recruitment videos for Al Qaeda, including a tape on the 1998 attack on the destroyer Cole. If convicted, he faces a life sentence.","4864":"There is, of course, still much to be done. American troops and Iraqis continue to die battling criminal elements of the Saddam Hussein regime and Qaeda terrorists. President Bush has correctly identified Iraq as the central front in the war on terrorism, as Osama bin Laden himself acknowledged when he told his followers \"the third world war has begun in Iraq\" and that it would \"end there in victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.\"","4865":"In the cat-and-mouse game between United States forces and Qaeda leaders, there have been attempts over several years to kill Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, and Mr. Zawahiri, with rumors that Mr. Zawahiri has been killed, or nearly killed.","4866":"A second American official who acknowledged that Mr. Zawahiri had been the target of the strike said it was probably too soon to know for certain whether he had been at the scene. The American official acknowledged that intelligence was often imperfect, and said that American operations in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region reflected a continuing, intensive effort to track down Mr. Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden and their followers.","4867":"It wasn't only the collapse of the World Trade Center that had symbolic value for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Albert Adato New Rochelle, N.Y., Jan. 11, 2006","4868":"For more than a year, Mr. Zawahiri has served as the principal public face of Al Qaeda, during a period in which Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, has not been seen or heard from. The last audiotapes from Mr. bin Laden were made public in December 2004; in the first three years after the 2001 attacks, he was seen and heard from more often. American intelligence agencies believe that Mr. bin Laden is still alive, but has adopted a low profile to avoid giving away clues that might allow the C.I.A. to identify his location.","4869":"But he perpetuates the circular thinking of the administration when he says, 'President Bush has correctly identified Iraq as the central front in the war on terrorism, as Osama bin Laden himself acknowledged when he told his followers 'the third world war has begun in Iraq' and that it would 'end there in victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.' '","487":"Yesterday, they staged mild recoveries in the morning but gave up those gains in the afternoon, in part because hopes seemed to be fading for concessions from Afghanistan on surrendering Osama bin Laden, whom Washington has identified as the prime suspect in the attacks.","4870":"Finally, on Sunday, the bulldozers of the Saudi Binladen Group, the engineering and construction company owned by the bin Laden family, rolled in to change all that. (The family, which has disowned Osama bin Laden, spells the company name and family name differently.)","4871":"In interviews, American counterterrorism officials said American military and intelligence personnel had moved in recent weeks to intensify a campaign against Mr. Zawahiri, second only to Osama bin Laden in the Al Qaeda hierarchy.","4872":"He said Pakistan had moved 80,000 troops into border areas in the effort to chase down operatives of Al Qaeda and block Taliban militants and foreign fighters from entering Afghanistan. But he expressed little hope of the imminent capture or killing of the top two leaders of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, saying they had the resources to move about the tribal areas and beyond without being detected.","4873":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Jan. 19 - Breaking more than a year's silence, Osama bin Laden warned Americans in an audiotape released on Thursday that Al Qaeda was planning more attacks on the United States, but he offered a \"long truce\" on undefined terms.","4874":"INTERNATIONAL A3-11 Bin Laden Warns U.S., Offers Truce with No Terms Breaking more than a year's silence, Osama bin Laden warned Americans in an audiotape that Al Qaeda was planning more attacks on the United States but he offered a 'long truce' on undefined terms.

Vice President Dick Cheney rejected that notion out of hand. He says we don't negotiate with terrorists, but in fact we always have.","4878":"Just a day after Osama bin Laden resurfaced in a lengthy audiotape, a new recording by his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, appeared, praising the 'martyrs of holy war' in Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories and elsewhere. The Central Intelligence Agency said that the voice on the 18-minute tape, posted on an Internet forum that has carried communiqu?of Al Qaeda, was Mr. Zawahiri's. It was not immediately clear when the recording was made, or whether it had any connection to the release of Mr. bin Laden's recording on Thursday. There was no mention, either, of last week's missile attacks by the United States on a Pakistani village in the country's remote northeast, where Mr. Zawahiri was thought to be attending a dinner.

Mr. Bush's comments may also create unrealistic expectations at home about what American military forces can do over the short run. Finding and capturing Osama bin Laden will be difficult without the cooperation of Afghanistan, and even the president may not know exactly how that can be accomplished. It is also unclear how many other terrorist leaders and networks must be put out of commission before terrorist threats are under control.","4880":"It is to the lasting shame of the Bush administration that almost four and a half years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden is still free to plan and issue threats against the United States and pretend to be in a position to offer a 'truce.'","4881":"I was disappointed to see that Osama bin Laden is apparently still breathing. I can't get away from telemarketers, but this guy's been dodging Special Forces for four years.","4882":"Osama bin Laden had his facts wrong, but his endorsement in an audiotape message this week of a book by a leftist author nevertheless pushed it up the online best-seller lists. Over the last two days, 'Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower' (Common Courage Press, 2000), a polemic by William Blum about American intervention abroad, has risen into the top 50 places on Amazon.com's best-seller list and into the mid-80's on Barnes &amp; Noble's online list. The jump came after Mr. bin Laden, right, cited the book in his most recent audio message and told Americans it would be 'useful for you to read.' He then quoted a passage that he said was in the book's introduction. In a telephone interview, however, Mr. Blum said the passage actually appears on the back cover of another of his books, 'Freeing the World to Death: Essays on the American Empire' (Common Courage Press, 2004). Mr. Blum said that he also frequently used the passage in speeches and that it had been widely circulated on the Internet, where he assumes it was picked up. The book has been translated into roughly a dozen foreign-language editions, Mr. Blum said, including Arabic. The passage quoted by Mr. bin Laden is an 'If I were president ' call to apologize for 'American imperialism' and end military interventions.

He was born in Jidda, Saudia Arabia; it is his father who was born in Hadhramaut Province in eastern Yemen.","4890":"IF Osama bin Laden's aim in releasing an audiotape was to gauge his enemies' reaction, he must have been gratified to find that America's leaders and opinion-makers understand him little better than they did on 9/11. The proof is in how his offer of a \"long-term truce\" was treated. The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, declared: \"We do not negotiate with terrorists.\" Vice President Dick Cheney saw Mr. bin Laden's offer as \"some kind of ploy.\" Newsweek described it as \"something new: an offer of an olive branch.\" Most saw it as a sign of weakness.","4893":"The most important of these to the United States are the safe zones that fugitive Qaeda leaders established after fleeing the Tora Bora caves in Afghanistan four years ago. It is inexcusable that a Pentagon already looking ahead to Iraq did not pour in enough American troops to block the escape of Osama bin Laden and his top deputies, the masterminds of the 9/11 attacks. Attacking them in wartime Afghanistan would have been far simpler, militarily and politically, than trying to catch up with them in tribal areas that even the Pakistani Army can't control. But that is where they are now, and where America's war against them must be fought.","4895":"Of course, a little reading wouldn't hurt. Rejecting the Bush mantra that Islamic radicals \"hate us for our freedoms,\" Raban, who wrote about the Middle East in his 1979 book, \"Arabia,\" traces Islamist antipathy back to the partitioning of Arabia by the West after World War I. The arbitrary borders paced off by Western diplomats required tyrants like Saddam Hussein to maintain them, and an Islamic-nationalist visionary like Osama bin Laden to imagine their erasure. Raban says that jihad is not an ancient passion but a modern one, its central text written by the Egyptian Sayyid Qutb after a stay in America in 1948-50. Qutb's critique of Western decadence would be familiar to anyone who has ever read Oswald Spengler or Eliot's \"Waste Land,\" which have also nurtured homegrown strains of alienation and rebellion. Scouring a jihad-friendly Web site, Raban observes, \"Its tirades on the moral degeneracy of the West are part of the banal stock-in-trade of our own far right, while its (sometimes quite astute) assaults on Western imperialism might come straight from the mouths of our own far left.\"","4896":"Mr. Zawahiri, shown wearing white robes and a white turban, said the Jan. 13 airstrike in the northeastern Pakistan village of Damadola had killed only 'innocents,' and called President Bush a 'butcher' and a 'failure' for the attack.

It weakens the nation's international leverage and empowers exactly the wrong countries. Last night Mr. Bush told the people that \"the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons,\" but he did not explain how that will happen when those same nations are so dependent on Tehran's oil. Iran ranks second in oil reserves only to Saudi Arabia, where members of the elite help finance Osama bin Laden and his ilk, and where the United States finds it has little power to stop them.","4898":"'I am concerned that some of my Democrat colleagues used this unique public forum to make clear that they believe the gravest threat we face is not Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, but rather the president of the United States,' Mr. Roberts said.

In October, Mirsad Bektasevic, a 19-year-old Swede from near Gothenburg, was arrested in Sarajevo in an apartment that contained suicide-bomb vests, explosives and a newly made video presumably intended for broadcast. Bektasevic, who was born to Muslim parents in prewar Yugoslavia and found refuge in Sweden as a 6-year-old, reportedly ran a Web site supporting Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. In October 2004, Osama bin Laden disparaged George Bush's claim that Al Qaeda hated freedom by saying, \"Let him tell us why we did not strike Sweden, for example.\" Sweden may have kept its distance from the Iraq war, but it has been unable to shelter itself from world events.","49":"For those who care more about wielding power than being loved, more about their own ambition than their countries' welfare, America's rules are merely an inconvenience to be circumvented or ignored.

In the recent debate, it was taken for granted that the original reports did not hurt our national security efforts, and any suggestions that they did cause damage were dismissed as urban myth. But the reality is that the revelation of the phone tracking was, without question, one of the most egregious examples of an unauthorized criminal disclosure of classified national defense information in recent years. It served no public interest. Ultimately, the bin Laden phone went silent.","4905":"In addition, Mr. Bush and one of his counterterrorism advisers said that four extremists were recruited from Southeast Asia to carry out the plan, that their leader received training in shoe bombs and that all four had traveled to an undisclosed place after the Sept. 11 attacks to meet with Osama bin Laden and pledge their loyalty to Al Qaeda.","4906":"There is something obscene about reading the self-justifications of an acknowledged mass murderer. But what makes the collected speeches, interviews, Web postings and other public statements of Osama bin Laden different from, say, \"Helter Skelter,\" is that bin Laden is not clinically mad. He gives reasons for his actions that, while morally outrageous and religiously irresponsible, could be accepted by otherwise logical people who shared his premises. This makes him more, not less, dangerous than the Charles Mansons among us. Bin Laden has an audience, of which he is acutely aware \u0097 a fact made particularly clear by his recent offer of a \"truce\" with America. His words, as much as his deeds, aim to convince others to embrace his view of the world and act accordingly.","4907":"The current stage of chemical proliferation, Tucker warns, involves terrorist groups, like the Aum Shinrikyo cultists who killed 19 people with sarin in two incidents in Japan in 1994 and 1995.

A forthcoming graphic novel from Frank Miller, the Batman writer whose credits include the graphic novels \"The Dark Knight Returns\" and the \"Sin City\" series, pits the caped crusader against Al Qaeda operatives who attack Gotham City, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Miller, who is 120 pages through the 200-page novel \u0097 called \"Holy Terror, Batman!\" \u0097 said it was an unabashed \"piece of propaganda\" and he left no doubt about the outcome. Such works have an honorable tradition, he said, noting: \"Superman punched out Hitler. So did Captain America. That's one of the things they're here for. These are our folk heroes. It just seems silly to chase around the Riddler when you've got Al Qaeda out there.\"","4911":"Robert Ferrigno's \"Prayers for the Assassin\" is a futuristic fantasy that puts an Orwellian nation, the Islamic Republic, where the United States of America used to be. The author does not treat this as a pleasant prospect. He imagines a 2040 in which New York and Washington are gone, Mecca is radioactive, Mount Rushmore has been eradicated and the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan has been renamed for Osama bin Laden.

Throughout his 35-year career in public service he has played leading roles in local, national and international arenas. But for the next month or so, his efforts will be performed on a much smaller stage, one with an actual box office and a paying audience.

But information about the terrorist network attributed to Osama bin Laden is scattered across a daunting region that the networks have tended to cover from London.","4920":"CAIRO, Monday, Feb. 20 (AP) \u0097 Osama bin Laden promised never to be captured and declared that the United States had resorted to the same \"repressive\" tactics used by Saddam Hussein, according to an audiotape purportedly by Mr. bin Laden posted Monday on a militant Web site.","4921":"Assembling an impressive collage of newsreels, live performances and interviews with admirers, \"Trudell\" delivers a fascinating account of its subject's most turbulent crusades. But the man who calls Western civilization \"the great lie\" and once compared Christopher Columbus to Osama bin Laden deserves more daring and objective scrutiny than this overly reverent tribute. No one in the film has a bad word to say about Mr. Trudell, despite his 17,000-page F.B.I. dossier; and by the time Robert Redford assures us that meeting him is not dissimilar to meeting the Dalai Lama, you may feel that all this worship does not do justice to an unusually stormy and complicated life.","4922":"If, as David Brooks writes, 'All Arabs may look alike to certain blowhard senators,' perhaps it is because they have taken a page from an administration that could not tell the difference between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Peter M. Shane Columbus, Ohio, Feb. 23, 2006","4923":"America is no longer the country to clean up this toxic trend. In fact America has been heads over heels in being a catalyst of this trend. Specially since Sept 12, 2001. Granted America did not create this toxicity.

[Osama bin Laden], Pakistan, Saudi [Arabia]. etc. The list is rather long. You know it too well for me to list. But it has been feeding this frenzy for several years.","4924":"In late 2004, Osama bin Laden called on militants to attack oil targets in the Persian Gulf region to stop the flow of oil, but until Friday there had not been any major attacks in the area.","4926":"Osama bin Laden has a new tape out. This one is scary. In it he announces his Oscar picks. Jon Stewart","4927":"Want to buy a European power company? Don\u2019t even think about it. Right now, it might be easier for Osama bin Laden to buy John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York than it is for a foreigner to buy a European power company, writes Matthew Lynn for Bloomberg News.","4928":"In a news conference with Mr. Karzai in Kabul, Mr. Bush said he remained confident Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, would be captured. They are believed to be hiding in Pakistan. \"It's not a matter of if they're captured or brought to justice, it's when they're brought to justice,\" Mr. Bush said.","4929":"At this moment in time, there is no more meaningful a place than Pakistan to illustrate the state of America's relations with the Muslim world. The country is ground zero in the fight against global terror. Anyone needing a fresh illustration need look no further than yesterday's bombing outside the American consulate in Karachi, which killed four people. Beyond the hunt for Osama bin Laden on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Pakistan is where radical fundamentalism is increasingly taking the moderate Islamic world hostage.","493":"Atiq Ullah, a cloth-seller in the northeastern city of Jalalabad, said his home town was too attractive a target for him to feel safe. Osama bin Laden once lived there. He returns from time to time.","4931":"The men were mostly captured in the 2001 American-led war that drove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and sent Osama bin Laden deeper into hiding.","4933":"Mr. Bush showed strong support for Mr. Musharraf's efforts in combating militants, even though Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, are believed to still be hiding in Pakistan. Without being specific, General Musharraf himself made reference to \"slippages\" in the past.","4934":"In an e-mail message, Mr. de Vere said he felt that Osama bin Laden and most of the organizers of the attacks would \"never be captured.\"","4936":"Among the accusations against Mr. Shirbi recounted in the hearing transcript were that he trained with Al Qaeda, was \"observed chatting and laughing like pals with Osama bin Laden,\" and was known as the \"right-hand man\" to Abu Zubaydah, a top Qaeda operative. Mr. Shirbi said he was willing to accept all of those accusations.","4938":"\"I really would like justice with Osama bin Laden \u0097 that's the man I really want,\" Ms. Williams said.","4939":"Edward J. MacMahon, one of the court-appointed lawyers who is conducting the defense over Mr. Moussaoui's objections, said it was true that his client had proudly proclaimed himself a member of Al Qaeda and said he was planning to fly a plane into the White House at the orders of Osama bin Laden.","494":"Mullah Omar is friends with Osama bin Laden. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorism suspect, is valued for his advice and military assistance. Between 5,000 and 10,000 Arabs are in Afghanistan, and many fight on the side of the Taliban against the diminishing but still stubborn opposition.","4940":"But the most immediate damage was done on Mr. Bush's next stop, Pakistan. Washington is trying to persuade Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani military dictator, to defy nationalist and Islamic objections and move more aggressively against Pakistani-based terrorists. This is no small issue because both Osama bin Laden and the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, are now believed to operate from Pakistani soil.","4941":"The videotaped deposition was taken in 2002. Mr. Bafana had been arrested in Singapore in November 2001 for plotting to blow up American military facilities there. He said Mr. Moussaoui visited him in 2000 and came with references that he had been sent by Osama bin Laden.","4942":"A prosecutor, David Novak, noted that when Mr. Moussaoui pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges in April, he admitted that he was in Al Qaeda and that he had met with its leader, Osama bin Laden, who told him to pursue his dream of flying an airplane into the White House.","4943":"Bush declared his \u201cglobal war on terrorism\u201d and then shifted its focus from Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden to Iraq and a wider crusade to reform the Arab states of the Middle East. The president never encouraged anti-Arab xenophobia, but neither did he make clear just who the enemy was. \u2026","4944":"'They blamed me for attacking U.S. forces,' he said, 'but I said I was handicapped; how could I fire a rifle?' he said, pointing to his hand. 'Then he asked me, 'Where is Osama bin Laden?' And I answered, 'Afghanistan.'

Or just a Phantom of the Opera clone who likes to kick back to the cult sounds of Antony and the Johnsons? Your guess is as good as mine, and I've seen the film.","495":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 18\u2014 Hard-line Islamic clerics who control Afghanistan's Taliban government today postponed for at least another 24 hours a final response to the American demand that they hand over Osama bin Laden and top lieutenants in his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.","4950":"In 2003, federal law enforcement officials revealed that they had uncovered a plot to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge and other targets. Prosecutors said an Ohio truck driver, Iyman Faris, traveled in Afghanistan and Pakistan beginning in 2000, meeting with Osama bin Laden. After returning to the United States in 2002, officials said, he began casing the bridge and discussing, via coded messages with Qaeda leaders, ways of using blowtorches to sever the suspension cables.","4952":"Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national accused of having been a bodyguard and driver for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, has been detained since 2002 in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He filed suit to challenge the legitimacy of the military commission that upheld his designation as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" \u0097 a term Mr. Bush invented after 9/11 to deny the protections of the Geneva Conventions, international statutes or United States law to certain prisoners.","4954":"If the thought of Mr. Bush and Osama bin Laden, along with their mothers, engaging in a salad-fork duel at an Olive Garden restaurant to the tune of \"America,\" from \"West Side Story,\" sounds appealing, this show is for you.","4955":"Mr. Moussaoui, who has sat quietly through the last two weeks of the trial, usually leaves the courtroom with some shouted slogan praising Osama bin Laden or cursing the United States. On Thursday, he offered a new statement, saying, 'I will testify whether you want it or not.'","4957":"Non-Arabic speakers may associate the pan-Arab satellite channel with videotapes of Osama bin Laden and gruesome execution videos \u0097 some broadcast on Western airwaves emblazoned with the Al Jazeera logo. But what the Arabic-speaking world sees as it tunes into Al Jazeera on any given night is itself \u0097 in regional dialects, in pictures and in stories of everyday life from across the Arab and Muslim worlds.","4958":"Salim Hamdan, born in Yemen, was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 and has confessed to working as a driver for Osama bin Laden. Like Mr. Moussaoui, Mr. Hamdan was charged with conspiring with Al Qaeda to commit acts of terrorism. The critical distinction, though, is that Mr. Hamdan was charged as a war criminal, meaning he was designated for prosecution before a military tribunal rather than in a federal court. His lawyers, led by Neal K. Katyal, a professor at Georgetown University, have sued to block the tribunal; hence Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.","4959":"WASHINGTON, March 26 \u0097 The Supreme Court's announcement four months ago that it would rule on the validity of the military commission by which the Bush administration wants to try Osama bin Laden's former driver, on charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism, appeared to mark a resumption of a struggle for supremacy between the court and the White House.","496":"Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, denied responsibility for an anti-immigrant flyer that was distributed Sunday at the party's annual gathering in Venice. The flyer bore an image of Osama bin Laden and the words 'Illegal Immigrants = Islamic Terrorists.' Italy has become an important point of entry for immigrants from Albania and points east, and nearly 1,000 landed in the south over the weekend. On Friday the center-right cabinet approved a draft law introducing tougher immigration regulations, including prison terms for illegal immigrants who return after being expelled. Marina Harss (NYT)","4960":"More than four years after Sept. 11, it is intolerable that America has no viable mechanism for trying al-Qaeda operatives. The masterminds of the attacks, Ramzi Binalshibh and Khalid Sheik Mohammed, are in U.S. custody, yet justice for them is not even on the radar screen. If American troops catch Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri tomorrow, the government has no means of bringing them to justice.","4961":"That is already the assertion of a growing crowd of bloggers and translators, almost exclusively on the right. So far they have highlighted documents that refer to a meeting between Osama bin Laden and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Sudan in 1995; a plan to train Arab militants as suicide bombers; and a 1997 document discussing the use of \"special ammunition,\" chemical weapons, against the Kurds.","4962":"Even though the 9/11 commission found no \"collaborative relationship\" between the ultrafundamentalist Osama bin Laden and the secular Saddam Hussein, the administration's reiterations of a supposed connection \u0097 Vice President Dick Cheney has argued that the evidence for such an alliance was \"overwhelming\" \u0097 have convinced two out of three Americans that they had \"strong\" links.","4963":"Al Qaeda, according to a newly revealed account from the chief plotter, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, took its time in choosing targets \u0097 attack the White House or perhaps a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania? Organizers sized up and selected operatives, teaching them how to apply for a visa and how to cut a throat, a skill they practiced on sheep and camels. Despite the mistakes of careless subordinates and an erratic boss, Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mohammed tried to keep the plot on course.","4964":"In December 2002, Ann Jones flew to Afghanistan and volunteered her services to a small charity. It was a year after the United States, in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden, had ended its high-altitude bombing of the countryside. \"Somehow I felt obliged to try to help pick up the pieces,\" writes Ms. Jones, a journalist and the author of \"Women Who Kill.\" That job, she quickly learned, was impossible, for reasons she itemizes in this furious polemic. There were too many pieces, too many warring factions, too many agendas, too much bad faith and too little money.","4965":"But the due-process standards of the commissions \u0097 and even whether they will go forward at all \u0097 now depend on the outcome of a challenge pending before the Supreme Court on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni accused of serving as a driver for Osama bin Laden.","4966":"\"Tell the truth. Fire the incompetents. Find Osama bin Laden and secure our ports and our homeland. Bring our troops home from Iraq. Obey the law and protect our civil rights,\" Mr. Kerry said in ticking off his list, which also included supporting health care, education, lobbying reform and alternatives to oil, as well as reducing the deficit.","4967":"Within Islam, fundamentalist Sunnis consider Shiism to be a heretical sect. In February 2004, a courier was intercepted by Kurds as he was reportedly carrying a message from the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to his leader in Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden. The letter laid out a strategy to inflame Sunnis in Iraq by murdering Shiites and thereby provoking them to counterattack Sunnis: \"If we succeed in dragging them into the arena of sectarian war,\" wrote Zarqawi about the Shiites, according to the English translation, \"it will become possible to awaken the inattentive Sunnis as they feel imminent danger.\"","4968":"The prosecution agreed to allow a statement to be read to jurors that it could not substantiate the claim by its chief witness in the case, Naseem Khan, a paid informant, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation hired him after he told agents that he had seen Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant in 1998 or 1999 at a mosque in Lodi, the farming town just south of Sacramento where the men on trial lived.","4969":"Many Spanish investigators have said that the typically horizontal structure of Islamic terrorist networks suggests that the group probably conceived and carried out the train bombings on its own, without any order or message from Osama bin Laden or his top lieutenants.","497":"Bush administration officials have said they would ask Prince Saud for intelligence on terrorist groups and for the kingdom's cooperation in retaliating against Osama bin Laden, the attacks' suspected mastermind. Law enforcement officials suspect that Mr. bin Laden, an exiled Saudi who lives in Afghanistan, blended members of several terrorist groups into a sophisticated network to carry out the attacks.","4970":"As the primary focus of the government's prosecution of 9/11, Mr. Moussaoui is a poor stand-in not only for Osama bin Laden, who remains at large, but also for Qaeda leaders directly involved in 9/11 who have been in custody for years. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the attacks, was apprehended in 2003. Ramzi bin Al-Shieb, who was a close associate of Mohamed Atta in Germany, is also in custody. So is the real \"20th hijacker,\" Mohamed al-Kahtani, who is being held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Any of these men would have been a more appropriate defendant than Mr. Moussaoui, based on actual involvement in the attacks, as a primary focus for the heartrending evidence of the mass murder of 9/11.","4971":"Many of the articles have castigated the paper as historically inaccurate and sloppy in its scholarship, with some critics saying for example that Osama bin Laden first focused on the United States because of its support for the Saudi government. Many have also criticized the professors as defining the so-called pro-Israel lobby so broadly as to render it all but meaningless, and as implying, by referring to it always as \"the Lobby\" with a capital L, that it operates in a monolithic, if not conspiratorial manner.","4972":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 13 \u0097 Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant has released an Internet video calling on Iraqi insurgents to remain strong in the fight against the Americans and praising the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant and most wanted man in Iraq.","4973":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 13 \u0097 Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant has released an Internet video calling on Iraqi insurgents to remain strong in the fight against Americans and praising the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant who directs Al Qaeda's operations in Iraq.","4974":"The truth, of course, is that he was a parasitic, failed careerist who had not one moral or political conviction that he wouldn't sell for a dime. Perpetually frustrated at being \"an untapped resource,\" Mr. Kassen's Hitler, a sweaty, excitable type, used his notorious name to his advantage more than half a century before relatives of Osama bin Laden and John Gotti had reality shows. When asked why he didn't change his name, Hitler said, poignantly, \"It's all I got.\"","4975":"The voices on the recording of the last moments of United Airlines Flight 93 were horrifying. Too bad the man on trial is not Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for these murders, rather than a pathetic, suicidal loser who had nothing to do with 9/11.","4976":"Government censors in Muslim states on the Persian Gulf have moved against the films \"Syriana\" and \"Brokeback Mountain,\" Agence France-Presse reported. When \"Syriana\" had its premiere last week in the United Arab Emirates, two minutes were cut from its tale of oil, terrorism, money and power, which was filmed partly in Dubai, a business hub and the most Westernized of the emirates. Gone were scenes that depicted mistreatment of Asian workers in Gulf states and references to Osama bin Laden and a Saudi king. Although \"Syriana\" opened in Egypt, it is unlikely to be shown anywhere else in the Middle East, according to its foreign distributor, Shooting Stars. Italia Films, the foreign distributor of the gay romance \"Brokeback Mountain,\" said it had canceled plans to show the movie in the Gulf after receiving negative responses in discussions of its theme with various ministries. George Clooney won the Oscar for best supporting actor in \"Syriana,\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\" won three Oscars, including best director for Ang Lee.","4977":"And more recently, at a meeting with agency heads at the Capitol, he compared the scheduled speakers at today's rally to Osama bin Laden and Jesse James","4978":"Mr. Rumsfeld would later argue that the Afghan operation had been a major success as the United States toppled the Taliban and eliminated Al Qaeda's camps by relying on Special Operations forces, Afghan allies, air strikes \u0097 and by avoiding the commitment of substantial ground forces. Critics, though, argued that the absence of adequate American soldiers had made it easier for Osama bin Laden to escape.","4979":"Mr. Negroponte was asked after his speech whether the new intelligence structure had brought the government any closer to catching Osama bin Laden. He said that while he wished the United States had already found Mr. bin Laden, the government had made great progress in capturing or killing several other members of the high command of Al Qaeda.","498":"Justice Department and F.B.I. officials, who acknowledged the existence of the internal investigation, said the inquiry had forced officials to examine their monitoring of several suspected terrorist groups, among them Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group. Al Qaeda is the group that President Bush and others have cited for last week's attacks.","4980":"This is, to say the least, highly unrealistic.

The protest came a day after the state's top law enforcement officer resigned amid criticism over his handling of the case and a joke that Gov. Jeb Bush called \"inappropriate.\" The Miami Herald reported that the official, Guy Tunnell, left, who headed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, compared Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, to Osama bin Laden and Mr. Jackson to the outlaw Jesse James at a meeting. Mr. Bush said he did not ask Mr. Tunnell to step down. (AP)","4982":"Mr. Judt himself does not defend either of these highly dubious propositions. If an Israeli 'lobby' were covertly manipulating our foreign policy, we would have intervened first in Iran.

The administration must conform to the law if it is to maintain world support for actions against terrorists.","4990":"The attack came one day after Al Jazeera television network broadcast an audiotape said to be of Osama bin Laden. There was no evidence that Mr. bin Laden or his Qaeda network was connected to the attacks.","4992":"He also said, according to excerpts of the video on the Al Arabiyya television network, that President Bush, out of \"arrogance,\" brushed off a long-term truce offer by Osama bin Laden. . He was apparently referring to Mr. bin Laden's offer of a truce conveyed in an audio recording broadcast on Jan. 19 by Al Jazeera, an Arab satellite network.Reuters said that Mr. Zarqawi also denounced the new Iraqi government as having been set up to help Washington find a way out of Iraq.","4993":"\"Nontransparent Monument,\" the fourth and most engrossing work here, is an update on Mr. Cai's Venice piece. It is a 32-foot-long limestone frieze carved in China by artisans whose lack of academic training gives a lively bluntness to its many small figures and scenes. These troll through a potpourri of the events, personalities, trends and disasters that have figured on the turbulent world stage over the last five years, starting with the 9/11 attack and including President Bush, Osama bin Laden, avian flu, the Three Gorges Dam, suicide bombers, Hurricane Katrina and the war in Iraq.","4994":"It was not immediately clear why Mr. Zarqawi would release such a video now. It was made public just two days after Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, released an audio tape accusing the West of a \"Zionist-crusaders war on Islam,\" a statement similar in parts to Mr. Zarqawi's.","4995":"Among the key havens for terrorists worldwide, Ambassador Henry A. Crumpton, the State Department's top counterterrorism official, listed Iraq's Al Anbar province along with Pakistan's North Waziristan province, the lawless region near the Afghanistan border where Al Qaeda's mastermind, Osama bin Laden, and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be hiding.","4996":"\"United 93\" is a sober reminder of the breakdown in leadership on the morning of Sept. 11. Unlike Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" the film doesn't get into the whereabouts of the president that day, or why Osama bin Laden ordered the attack; its focus is purposely narrow. But that narrow focus, along with the lack of fully realized characters, and the absence of any historical or political context, raises the question of why, notwithstanding the usual (if shaky) commercial imperative, this particular movie was made. To jolt us out of complacency? Remind us of those who died? Unite us, as even the film's title seems to urge? Entertain us?","4997":"While political fiction is often used to disguise real-life identities, one of the festival's strongest works is an amazing hybrid. Michael Winterbottom combines fact and fiction in \"The Road to Guant\u00e1namo\" (opening commercially on June 23), recounting the story of the Muslim men from Britain now known as the Tipton Three. In 2001 they set off for a wedding in Pakistan, took a side trip to Afghanistan and were captured by the Northern Alliance, held at an American military camp and later shipped to Guant\u00e1namo. They remained imprisoned there for two years, until evidence emerged that they were still in Britain at the time they were accused of having been at a rally with Osama bin Laden.","4998":"Ambassador Henry A. Crumpton, the State Department's top counterterrorism official, in a briefing on major havens for terrorists worldwide, singled out Anbar Province in Iraq and the North Waziristan region in Pakistan \u0097 the tribal area near the Afghan border where Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be hiding.","4999":"The video came the same week as an audiotape by Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, and a video by the head of the Qaeda branch in Iraq.","5":"Moreover, prosecutors in New York are regarded as the country's top experts in overseas terror groups, like the loose network inspired by the Islamic terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. The shift of the case to the New York office suggested that investigators would expand their inquiry outside the United States.","50":"A court ordered the extradition of two Egyptians to the United States to face charges of conspiring with the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Hadi Eidarous and Adel Mohammed Abdul Almagid Bary can appeal the order, a Bow Street Magistrates' Court official said. Warren Hoge (NYT)","500":"Why were we so blind? Osama bin Laden recently made threats in the London press. Islamic zealots have repeatedly shown their willingness to get to heaven -- a heaven where 70 virgins await each 'martyr' -- by committing homicide even as they committed suicide. They already tried to topple the World Trade Center eight years earlier. Much of the Arab street abhors the United States. The kamikaze pilots during World War II showed how easy it is to turn a plane into a weapon. Middle East C.I.A. analysts, not even required to speak Arabic, should at least be expected to have as much imagination as Hollywood screenwriters.","5000":"Ambassador Henry A. Crumpton, the State Department's top counterterrorism official, in a briefing on major havens for terrorists worldwide, singled out Anbar Province in Iraq and the North Waziristan region in Pakistan -- the tribal area near the Afghan border where Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and his second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be hiding.","5001":"THE KING The News -- In a televised speech, King Gyanendra of Nepal conceded to demands that he restore Parliament, seemingly ending his 14-month takeover of power. Behind the News -- The concession, which came after nearly three weeks of pro-democracy protests in which at least 13 people were killed, did little to end the political chaos in Nepal. A coalition of seven parties accepted the king's offer and even agreed on a prime minister. But Maoist rebels and street protestors denounced it, saying they doubted whether the king had agreed to a main demand, a referendum on a constitution that would decide the fate of the monarchy. THE TERRORIST The News -- A man who identified himself as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of Al Qaeda in Iraq, appeared in a video predicting 'defeat and humiliation' for what he called the American 'crusader' effort. Behind the News -- Intelligence agencies concluded that it was indeed Mr. Zarqawi in the video, which is a resurfacing of sorts for the man believed responsible for scores of bombings in Iraq. The question was, why now? One suggestion was that it was a form of one-upmanship directed at Osama bin Laden, who released an audio tape two days before. There is thought to be a certain degree of rivalry between the two men, and Mr. Zarqawi may have been trying to remind the world how active he has been in recent years compared with Mr. bin Laden. THE EX-C.E.O. The News -- Kenneth L. Lay, founder and former chief executive of Enron, testified in his own defense at his fraud trial in Houston. Behind the News -- Mr. Lay's first days on the stand were marked by an absence of the kind of charm he was known for during Enron's glory days. He was agitated with just about everyone: prosecutors, former colleagues, journalists, investors and even his own lawyer. He particularly bridled when, under cross-examination, a prosecutor suggested he had tried to tamper with witnesses. Mr. Lay's demeanor stood in sharp contrast to that of his co-defendant, Jeffrey K. Skilling, who despite a reputation for arrogance managed to keep his cool during his testimony. THE SPOKESMAN The News -- Tony Snow made his first appearance as President Bush's press secretary. Behind the News -- Mr. Snow, a former Fox News commentator who at times has been critical of the president, is expected to bring a bolder, flashier style to the daily televised briefings at the White House. His appointment, part of a larger shake-up of the White House staff by the new chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, was regarded as an acknowledgment that the administration needs a new, less scripted approach to dealing with the press. THE COUNSELOR The News -- Karl Rove, the president's senior counselor, made his fifth appearance before a federal grand jury in the C.I.A. leak case. Behind the News -- Mr. Rove's testimony signaled renewed activity in the special prosecutor's investigation into how the name of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson, was revealed. For Mr. Rove it came at a delicate time. His role in shaping White House policy was recently reduced, and any legal concerns may distract him from his main mission, keeping Republicans in control in both houses of Congress through the midterm elections this fall.","5002":"In our own time of \"great fear and pain,\"Armstrong proposes that we look to the Axial sages for \"two important pieces of advice,\" both of which turn out to be quite uncontroversial: We should practice self-criticism (amen), and we should \"take practical, effective action\" against excessively aggressive tendencies in our own traditions (amen again). But after 400 pages of historical argument, the banality of such declarations is staggering. Yes, we need to learn to see things from other points of view. But once we have done that, once indifference and ignorance and prejudice and other obstacles are cleared away, real differences \u0097 political, religious, cultural \u0097 remain. As for \"simple answers,\" it all depends on what you mean by simple. Does Job offer simple answers? Does Benedict XVI? The Dalai Lama? Osama bin Laden? Richard Dawkins?","5003":"Sudan quickly distanced itself from the recent statement by Osama bin Laden that referred to Sudan, Darfur and jihad. Sudan will not be a pawn in any organization's war against the West.","5004":"As Gordon and Trainor observe, the Bush administration's decision to launch a pre-emptive invasion amounted to a wholesale repudiation of the so-called Powell doctrine, which insisted on patiently assembling overwhelming force before entering any foreign conflict. This was not academic hairsplitting, but a fundamental rift in the Republican Party. Colin Powell's credo was a lineal descendant of the Weinberger doctrine, announced by his mentor, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in 1984 to justify bolting from Lebanon after the suicide bombing of a Marine barracks \u0097 a strategic humiliation that many Republican hawks view as the origin of America's current woes in the war on terror, since it helped convince Osama bin Laden, among others, that the United States was a cowardly weakling that would flee when hit hard.","5005":"But the officials interviewed on Sunday also said that the messages of the three men \u0097 Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi \u0097 show the differing motives and political interests of Al Qaeda's leadership.","5006":"But the officials interviewed on Sunday also said that the messages of the three men -- Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- show the differing motives and political interests of Al Qaeda's leadership.","5007":"At another point he called the war in Afghanistan \"successful,\" noting that the Taliban had been ousted from power and that elections had been held. Later, when pressed, he acknowledged that a primary American goal \u0097 the capture of Osama bin Laden \u0097 had not been achieved.","5008":"\"God curse America and God save Osama bin Laden!\" Mr. Moussaoui shouted after Federal Judge Leonie M. Brinkema pronounced the sentence that jurors agreed upon on Wednesday.","5009":"The Justice and Equality Movement, an Islamic group with ties to Hassan al-Turabi, the religious hardliner who invited Osama bin Laden to Sudan, is the smallest and least powerful group. It requested the most radical changes to the peace agreement, but some diplomats involved in the negotiations said they did not regard this group as a significant threat to the peace deal.","501":"The Islamic clerics who control Afghanistan's Taliban government postponed a final response to the demands that they hand over Osama bin Laden. PAGE B5","5010":"The trial was a triumph of the American justice system; the sad part is that it was not Osama bin Laden on trial.","5011":"Mr. Moussaoui, in his last chance to be heard in public, delivered a political speech about his hate for America, concluding: \"God curse America and save Osama bin Laden. You'll never get him.\"","5012":"The case, involving a Jordanian college student living in San Diego, has been viewed as a test of the government's detention policies in terrorism investigations. The student, Osama Awadallah, gave contradictory testimony to a grand jury in the case of United States v. Osama bin Laden, but his lawyers had argued that a long solitary confinement had left him disoriented and confused.","5013":"In response to a question, from Mr. Elshafay, he said that he did not think Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and suggested that the United States itself was. He also said, \"if you knock down the entire World Trade Center a hundred times without killing people, I, I personally would definitely agree with them.\"","5014":"A Final Outburst by Moussaoui at Sentencing A judge sentenced Zacarias Moussaoui to prison for the rest of his life, saying he will be denied his wish to die in a blaze of glory and instead 'will die with a whimper.' But in his last chance to be heard in public, Mr. Moussaoui showed no remorse and spoke about his hate for this country, saying: 'God curse America and save Osama bin Laden. You'll never get him.'

It sought the most radical changes to the peace agreement, most of which were not accepted.","5018":"In the grand jury hearing, held in 2001 in the case of United States v.

He has not been accused of foreknowledge of the attacks.","5019":"The movement has ties to Hassan al-Turabi, the religious hard-liner who invited Osama bin Laden to Sudan.

But he suggested that may change if the United States strikes back. 'We all made fun of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War.'","5021":"Kunar has been one of the most dangerous areas for the United States-led coalition and Afghan forces. It is across the border from a Pakistani region that Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are thought to visit from time to time.","5022":"The police now say that is when he and a group of other local young men began to form their terrorist cell. The cell, Tawhid and Jihad, was heavily influenced by men like Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and by Wahhabism, an austere sect of radical Islam whose roots lie in the Arabian Peninsula.","5025":"Does he think that Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda are so obtuse that they would not expect surveillance of their phone calls by United States intelligence agencies?","5026":"We now know. We also overhear the first whisperings about the \"charismatic son of an immensely wealthy Jidda clan.\" Osama bin Laden. And then there's this speech from a wealthy Saudi who buys sexual favors for United States officers as extra incentive to do business with him.","5027":"Does he think that Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda are so obtuse that they would not expect surveillance of their phone calls by United States intelligence agencies?","5028":"We still don't know where Osama bin Laden is hiding, but I'm at peace now, knowing that our government knows how many times I called my grandma this week to see how she's doing since she fell last Saturday.

Before last week, I had thought of myself as a lawyer, a feminist, a wife, a sister, a friend, a woman on the street. Now I begin to see myself as a brown woman who bears a vague resemblance to the images of terrorists we see on television and in the newspapers. I can only imagine how much more difficult it is for men who look like Mohamed Atta or Osama bin Laden.","5030":"Back in the 1990's, under the directorship of John Deutch, the C.I.A. suffered from similar organizational angst. There were unending process reviews, turf battles with the F.B.I. and Pentagon, and a Congressional review that debated the merits of breaking up the agency, which was then called a cold war dinosaur. A sense of paralysis engulfed us. Assigned to an important country in the Persian Gulf, I went to work each day not knowing what I was supposed to do, what secrets to steal or whether anyone remembered I was there, since my mail went unanswered. These were the days when Osama bin Laden first declared war on the United States from his new base in the mountains of Afghanistan \u0097 an act that went largely unnoticed by a distracted and demoralized C.I.A.","5031":"The Bush crowd, which gets together each morning to participate in a highly secret ritual of formalized ineptitude, is trying to get its creepy hands on all the telephone records of everybody in the entire country. It supposedly wants these records, which contain crucial documentation of calls for Chinese takeout in Terre Haute, Ind., and birthday greetings to Grandma in Talladega, Ala., to help in the search for Osama bin Laden.","5032":"Looked at this way, President Bush is only a few steps away from Osama bin Laden (in the 1970's he ran a company partly financed by the American representative for one of the Qaeda leader's brothers). And terrorist hermits like the Unabomber are connected to only a very few people. So much for finding the guilty by association.","5033":"After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Crile was quickly able to broadcast interviews he had previously shot, but had not yet shown publicly, of close associates of Osama bin Laden.","5034":"CHITRAL, Pakistan, May 14 \u0097 This quiet resort, better known for its polo games and mountain treks, has become the latest site of interest in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, much to the outrage and bemusement of its inhabitants.","5035":"The prosecutor also asked whether Mr. Siraj had said that he would be unhappy if the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden were captured \"because he was doing jihad for Islam.\" He asked whether Mr. Siraj said in August 2003 that he was disappointed that a British man had been arrested with a surface-to-air missile because he wanted to see more attacks in the United States. He also asked whether he had told Kamil about beating a man with a piece of wood or a piece of metal.","5036":"Mr. Chambliss enraged Democratic Party leaders that year when he defeated Senator Max Cleland, a Democrat, in part by questioning Mr. Cleland's resolve for fighting terrorism. Mr. Chambliss ran a commercial that featured images of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein and criticized Mr. Cleland's votes against certain national security bills. Mr. Cleland lost three limbs while serving in the Vietnam War.","5037":"She continued: \"And I know that despite all the havoc that my country has wrought overseas in my name, Osama bin Laden still has not been found, nor have those weapons of mass destruction.\"","5038":"She added, \"Osama bin Laden still has not been found, nor have those weapons of mass destruction.\"","5039":"Mr. Stolar conceded that many of the statements his client made on the recordings were \"despicable stuff\" \u0097 the young man praised Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, said he approved of suicide bombings in Israel and Palestine and repeatedly talked about killing Jews.","504":"That resolution imposed stern sanctions on the Afghan rulers and demanded, among other things, the handover of Osama bin Laden, at that time for the August 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in Africa. Mr. bin Laden is now also wanted for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","5040":"WASHINGTON, May 23 \u0097 In a new tape posted on the Web today, Osama bin Laden reasserted his role as the planner of the Sept. 11 attacks and declared that Zacarias Moussaoui played no role in the 2001 plot.","5041":"WASHINGTON, May 23 \u0097 In a new videotape posted on the Internet on Tuesday, Osama bin Laden reasserted his role as the planner of the Sept. 11 attacks and declared that Zacarias Moussaoui had played no role in the 2001 plot.","5043":"INTERNATIONAL A3-19 A Galaxy of Armed Groups Propel Iraq Towards Chaos The effort to arm Iraqi soldiers and officers, coupled with a failure to curb militia gunmen, has created a galaxy of armed groups, each with its own loyalty and agenda, which American and Iraqi officials fear is accelerating the country's slide into chaos.

He also appeared to dampen any expectation that the killing of the Jordanian-born militant meant an early end to the American mission there.","5072":"Zarqawi was the operational commander of the terrorist movement in Iraq. He led a campaign of car bombings, assassinations and suicide attacks that has taken the lives of many American forces and thousands of innocent Iraqis.

Easily the deadliest terrorist at work over the last three years, Mr. Zarqawi was probably responsible for more deaths than Osama bin Laden and leaves behind a jihadist movement that has been drastically changed in no small part by his actions.","5077":"\"While Osama bin Laden traditionally relied on Al Jazeera and the media to disseminate his propaganda, Zarqawi went straight to the Internet, which enabled him to produce graphic videos that would never have been shown on the mainstream media,\" said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute.","5078":"Mr. Zarqawi's relationships with home-grown leaders of that insurgency and with top Al Qaeda leaders around Osama bin Laden were, in fact, often troubled.

Military officials portrayed him as a global threat on the scale of Osama bin Laden and shared letters they say he wrote urging sectarian war in Iraq. However, several people who knew Mr. Zarqawi well, including former cellmates, voiced doubts about his ability to be an insurgent leader, or the leader of anything.","5081":"At Cheim &amp; Read, the artist's first paintings (silk screens) present enlarged copies of declassified, sometimes heavily censored documents from American military and intelligence agencies that are now available to the public because of the Freedom of Information Act.

A11 SCIENCE TIMES F1-8 Neurology of Teenage Drinking Mounting research suggests that alcohol causes more damage to the developing brains of teenagers than was previously thought, injuring them significantly more than it does adult brains. The findings have demolished the assumption that people can drink heavily for years before causing themselves significant neurological injury. F1 Rediscovering the Dodo A team of scientists has been exploring a trove of dodo fossils that may be as old as 3,000 years. They expect the site to offer the first clear picture of the dodo's ecological world before humans arrived. It may allow them to better understand how the stocky, flightless bird and many other species became extinct. F3 Developing a Nicotine Vaccine Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and eight other institutions have just started a major study of a vaccine that seeks to block the pleasurable sensations of satisfying a nicotine addiction. The vaccine would stimulate the production of antibodies that would latch onto nicotine molecules and prevent them from reaching the brain.

Lieberman of Connecticut, reacting to a strong challenge from Ned Lamont, a wealthy businessman and political newcomer, announced that he would begin gathering the 7,500 petitions necessary to put his name on the independent ballot should he lose the state Democratic primary next month. A1 SPORTSTUESDAY D1-6 Sorenstam Wins Open Annika Sorenstam, the top-ranked player in the world, won her third career United States Open when she shot a one-under-par 70 to defeat Pat Hurst by four strokes in an 18-hole playoff that offered little drama.

Crossword E8 TV Listings E11 Weather D7","5132":"Indeed, those celebrities who perform on audio books see it mainly as a way to express their support for a friend or favorite author. Jello Biafra, the former lead singer of the Dead Kennedys, said he agreed to read the part of Osama bin Laden on Mr. Palast's \"Armed Madhouse\" because he wanted to help Mr. Palast get out his muckraking message about the Bush administration. (MP3 clip.)","5133":"Though Harry Potter's birth preceded our 9/11-conditioned era by a number of years, Julia discovered him at precisely the time that she learned of the downing of the twin towers. She learned of Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and (despite my best efforts) Adolf Hitler at just the time when she was deepening her understanding of the dark Lord Voldemort. Just as I took refuge in Pa Ingalls's house precisely at the time, in the mid-1970's, when the anxieties of being a \"tween\" overwhelmed me, Julia found solace behind the thick walls of Hogwarts when she most needed protection.","5134":"As we approach the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, American and NATO forces are fighting a resurgent Taliban. Leaders like Mullah Muhammad Omar remain at large, and Osama bin Laden emerges regularly to threaten the West and inspire his followers.","5137":"Though North Korea and the struggle over responding to the missile tests dominated the news conference, Mr. Bush denied that the United States was trimming back on its search for Osama bin Laden by disbanding a unit within the Central Intelligence Agency that focused on that hunt.","5138":"As evidence, the researchers point to statements and videos posted by the Army of Islam on a Web site serving as a primary forum for Al Qaeda and like-minded groups. The group says it is not fighting \"for a piece of land\" but waging a religious war aimed at restoring a religious caliphate, or government, throughout the Muslim world. Much of the video includes a photograph of Osama bin Laden.","5139":"\"It was meant to deal with terrorism,\" said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat who voted for the bill. \"We were talking about Osama bin Laden, not gang members.\"","514":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 19\u2014 Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, went on nationwide television tonight to offer a tense, sometimes emotional defense of his decision to join the United States in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. General Musharraf said the situation presented this volatile Muslim nation of 140 million people with its gravest crisis in the 30 years since it lost its last major war, with India.","5140":"Mr. Mershon said an attack was to have been carried out in October or November; Lebanese authorities confirmed that timing.

The ban set off a flood of media commentary, much of it questioning the ministry's decision. After a screening was held for Malaysian members of Parliament, the home minister, Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, said the real problem was that the absence of violence in the documentary could create the misconception that Chin Peng was not himself violent. \"It will be like allowing a film portraying Osama bin Laden as a humble and charitable man to be screened in the United States,\" Mr. Radzi told a local newspaper.","5143":"The afternoon before the Supreme Court handed down its instantly historic ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift, the Navy defense lawyer appointed to represent the man who has admitted to being Osama bin Laden's driver, Salim Hamdan, told me he was reading a minority opinion written 60 years earlier, in the wake of World War II, by one of the court's lesser-known justices, Wiley B. Rutledge. The case involved Tomoyuki Yamashita, a Japanese general who'd been convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death by a U.S. military tribunal, a verdict upheld by the court, 6-2, despite some glaring procedural deficiencies: among other things, the admission of hearsay evidence including propaganda films and unnamed witnesses.","5144":"CAPE CANAVERAL The News -- The space shuttle Discovery safely lifted off and later docked with the International Space Station. Behind the News -- The flight was the shuttle system's first in a year, and only the second since the Columbia disintegrated on re-entry in 2003, killing the seven-member crew. In this launching there appeared to be no major damage from foam insulation falling off the shuttle's external fuel tank, a problem that had doomed Columbia and that had cropped up again on the flight a year ago. But if NASA seemed to have taken care of one headache, it faced longer-term ones: how to re-establish a presence in space with a diminished shuttle fleet that is expected to be retired in 2010, and how to fight a perception that its programs, particularly the space station, lack purpose. NORH KOREA The News -- North Korea went on a rocket-launching spree, firing at least seven missiles over the Sea of Japan, including one that is designed to be able to reach Alaska. Behind the News -- The long-range missile, the Taepodong 2, failed or was aborted shortly after launching and fell into the Sea of Japan. But some United States officials said even a failure would provide some valuable information for the North Koreans, who seem intent on developing a long-range missile capability. The White House, which had long ignored Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, has more recently tried to engage him in diplomacy, urging international support for strong measures, including sanctions, to get the country to drop its weapons program. But China and Russia resisted the move. THE MIDDLE EAST The News -- Hamas militants fired a small rocket deeper into Israel, prompting the Israeli military to move farther into Gaza. Behind the News -- The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, called the Qassam rocket fired from Gaza that landed in Ashkelon, a city of 115,000 six miles from the Gaza border, an 'escalation without precedent.' It and the other launchings were also evidence that the Israeli strategy of positioning troops just inside Gaza was ineffective. So the military moved farther into the territory, taking up positions near abandoned Israeli settlements. Prime Minister Olmert faced a delicate balancing act: pushing militarily against Hamas while trying to get the organization, and its military wing, to release a captured Israeli soldier. WASHINGTON The News -- Central Intelligence Agency officials said the agency had closed a unit that had hunted for Osama bin Laden. Behind the News -- The disbanding of the unit, which had been in operation since long before the Sept. 11 attacks, is a sign of increased concern that other groups have begun carrying out attacks independent of Mr. bin Laden, and that Al Qaeda is a more decentralized organization than it once was. Agency officials said that while efforts to capture Mr. bin Laden were as strong as ever, the better plan was to focus on regional trends rather than specific individuals or groups. But one former senior C.I.A. official said the closing would hurt the search for the Qaeda leader. ATLANTA The News -- Federal agents in Atlanta foiled a plot to sell Coca-Cola Company secrets to PepsiCo. Behind the News -- A Coca-Cola employee and two other people were arrested and charged with stealing the information and trying to sell it for $1.5 million to PepsiCo, which alerted Coca-Cola officials to the plot. The authorities said they had videotaped one of those arrested, an executive administrative assistant at the company, stuffing documents into bags and holding a small vial containing a product sample. It appeared that the purloined information concerned a beverage under development; a Coca-Cola spokesman said the most jealously guarded secret, the recipe for Coca-Cola Classic, was safe and sound. The company said it would tighten security.","5145":"\u201cThis is striking given the recent mentions of the janjaweed in Osama bin Laden\u2019s most recent public pronouncements, where the Arabs fighters in Sudan are congratulated along with the Islamists in Somalia.","5146":"The video also plays old audio messages from both Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant who was killed in an American airstrike in early June. An umbrella group associated with Mr. Zarqawi, the Mujahedeen Shura Council, put out the video.","5147":"The film stars three terrorists: Shehzad Tanweer, one of the July 7 bombers who died during the attack; Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden\u0092s deputy and long-time chief ideologue; and Adam Gadahn, a 28-year-old American who grew up on a goat ranch in Riverside, Calif., and converted to radical Islam.","5148":"It is only now, nearly five years after Sept. 11, that the full picture of the Bush administration\u2019s response to the terror attacks is becoming clear. Much of it, we can see now, had far less to do with fighting Osama bin Laden than with expanding presidential power.","5149":"Mr. Pape\u0092s statistics notwithstanding, the Sept. 11 attacks stand as the prime example of what President Bush initially labeled \u0093terrorists of global reach\u0094 \u0097 those whose goals transcend any local dispute and whose ambitions are mass murder with no immediately practical goal. Osama bin Laden\u0092s radicalization involved territorial issues \u0097 Soviet troops in Afghanistan and then American troops in Saudi Arabia \u0097 but his organization ultimately embraced terror not as a means but as an end.","515":"Pakistan has become crucial to the American campaign to root out Osama bin Laden, the leading suspect is the terrorist attacks. Turkey is a NATO ally that straddles Europe and the Middle East and joined the United States during the Persian Gulf war.","5151":"Did Osama bin Laden, in his war against the United States, try to minimize the 9/11 civilian casualties? Do Hezbollah and Hamas try to minimize civilian casualties?","5152":"It is clear that the White House is not determined in its \u0093fight\u0094 against terrorism. If it was, why did we divert our superior military away from Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda? Why are we refusing to adopt measures to protect the homeland?","5154":"It is clear that the White House is not determined in its 'fight' against terrorism.

Do Hezbollah and Hamas try to minimize civilian casualties?","5156":"Together with artists from several countries, Mr. Ehrmann, who occupies the house with his two Great Danes, Saatchi and Reuters, has painted the two-story house and the wall around it black and arrayed them with giant black-and-white portraits of noted personalities, including eight popes, as well as President Bush and Osama bin Laden.","5157":"Mr. Haqqani, who was years ago an American ally in the anti-Soviet campaign, has also been long suspected of sheltering Osama bin Laden. He is a crusty warrior with a great deal of credibility in Afghanistan because 20 years ago, rather than sip tea with journalists like some other rebel leaders, he was laying siege to Soviet positions.","5158":"Al Qaeda\u2019s leader, Osama bin Laden, has called Somalia a front in his global war against the United States and its allies.","5159":"The two sheiks, like many Sunni militants, belong to the fundamentalist Salafiya branch of Islam, which regards Shiites as little better than non-Muslims. Osama bin Laden is a Salafist, as was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian jihadist who declared war on Shiites in Iraq and helped drag the country into its sectarian violence before he was killed by an American airstrike last month.","516":"Why are Afghans not told that their rulers' decision to hide Osama bin Laden is the direct cause of the withdrawal of U.N. relief and the starvation that they now face?","5160":"In an interview, the cleric said the United States was helping religious extremists by encouraging the Israelis to continue their onslaught. By not working harder to stop the deaths of scores of Lebanese women and children, he said, the United States is abetting the recruiting efforts of the likes of Osama bin Laden and the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.","5161":"\u201cTabloid Wars\u201d is not really about the circulation battle between New York\u2019s two famously competitive tabloids. In this series The New York Post is barely seen. Mostly the rival\u2019s name is invoked with smoldering hatred, like Osama bin Laden or Moby-Dick.","5162":"A federal appeals court granted a Bush administration request to make more legal arguments over the fate of hundreds of lawsuits filed by detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. A three-judge panel set a schedule for lawyers for the government and the detainees to provide their views in writing over the next few weeks about the impact of the Supreme Court\u0092s ruling in June in the case of a driver for Osama bin Laden, Salim Ahmed Hamdan. The order, filed Wednesday, means there will be a rare fourth round of legal filings to determine the fate of lawsuits that detainees filed challenging their detentions.","5165":"Democrats recall the 2002 campaign against Senator Max Cleland, Democrat of Georgia, as a turning point. Mr. Cleland, a triple amputee who was awarded a Silver Star in Vietnam, was defeated after an advertising campaign that accused him of being soft on national defense, at one point flashing images of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.","5168":"There is no way to overstate the potential danger of an accelerated nuclear arms race in South Asia. Breeding nukes willy-nilly is an invitation to Armageddon. Pakistan, for those who need to be reminded, is where Osama bin Laden and his henchmen are thought to be hiding. It\u2019s also the home of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the pied piper of proliferation (now under house arrest) who provided crucial nuclear materials and expertise to Iran, North Korea and Libya.","5169":"As children zoomed by on tricycles and shot basketballs at a community center near his home, Mr. Barrett, 47, described how some news organizations (the French daily newspaper Figaro and Radio France International, in fact) had reported that an agent from the Central Intelligence Agency visited with Osama bin Laden two months before the attacks. He also said fires could not have caused the collapse of the World Trade Center towers at free-fall speed, as reported by the special Sept. 11 commission. \u201cThe 9/11 report will be universally reviled as a sham and a cover-up very soon,\u201d said Mr. Barrett, who has been a teacher\u2019s assistant or lecturer on Islam, African literature and other subjects at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, since 1996. \u201cThe 9/11 commission has its conspiracy theory, and we have ours.\u201d","517":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 19\u2014 President Bush ordered heavy bombers and other aircraft to within easy striking distance of Afghanistan today and insisted that its ruling Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden and other suspected leaders of a terrorist organization believed to be behind last week's attacks in New York and Washington.","5170":"So far the pace of casualties exceeds that of 2005, when 86 troops died in the worst year for coalition forces since American troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 after its Taliban rulers harbored Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","5171":"\u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d the title of Lawrence Wright\u2019s remarkable new book about Al Qaeda and 9/11, refers not only to the doomed towers of the World Trade Center, but also to a passage in the Koran, which Osama bin Laden quoted several times in a speech exhorting the 19 hijackers to become martyrs to their cause: \u201cWherever you are, death will find you/even in the looming tower.\u201d","5172":"Osama bin Laden","5173":"Mr. Lieberman also accused Mr. Lamont\u0092s campaign of using \u0093lies\u0094 and \u0093bogus charges\u0094 to try to defeat him. He made his remarks alongside Max Cleland, the former Democratic senator of Georgia, who was defeated for re-election in 2002 after Republicans linked Mr. Cleland to Osama bin Laden for his opposition to some homeland security measures.","5176":"He acknowledged similarities to a similar plot hatched by Al Qaeda operatives 12 years ago to simultaneously blow up airliners over the Pacific. The conspirators in that plot were Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, who was starting his climb to become a top Al Qaeda operative, and Ramzi Yousef, who was the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. The plot was financed by Osama bin Laden.","5177":"That plot was hatched in Manila by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was starting his climb to be a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, and by Ramzi Yousef, who was the mastermind of the first bomb attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. It was financed by bin Laden.","5178":"Part of the point of \u201cIn the Footsteps of Bin Laden,\u201d reported by Christiane Amanpour (see Q &amp; A below), is that Osama bin Laden knows digital video.","5179":"It also mimicked a failed plot in the Philippines in 1995 financed by Osama bin Laden to blow up airplanes over the Pacific. That ended when the chemicals exploded at an apartment in Manila.","518":"Not too far from Conte, near the paddock, a group of men held a lively discussion. Instead of the usual intense debate about pace and speed figures, however, the talk was about the rugged terrain of Afghanistan and the elusiveness of Osama bin Laden.","5181":"That scheme was developed in Manila by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who was starting his climb to become a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who was a mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Philippine investigators came to believe that the Manila operation was financed by Mr. bin Laden.","5182":"\u0093The great problem is that Al Qaeda has moved far beyond being a terrorist organization to being almost a state of mind,\u0094 said Simon Reeve, author of a 1999 book on Osama bin Laden and his associates. \u0093That\u0092s terribly significant because it gives the movement a scope and longevity it didn\u0092t have before 9/11.\u0094","5184":"One of the major points of contention is the degree to which Pakistani and foreign militants, including Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda\u0092s leaders, continue to find sanctuary in the mountainous tribal areas that run along the border with Afghanistan.","5185":"The question of whether Osama bin Laden and his network might have given direction to the London bombers in the attack last year is still being analyzed by British and American intelligence officials and remains unresolved, according to an American counterterrorism official.","5186":"What if he produces Osama bin Laden the night before the election?","5187":"In Crawford this week, Mr. Snow told reporters there were two approaches to fighting terrorism: \u0093And in the Connecticut race, one of the approaches is to ignore the difficulties and walk away.\u0094 He added, \u0093Now, when the United States walked away, in the opinion of Osama bin Laden in 1991, bin Laden drew from that the conclusion that Americans were weak and wouldn\u0092t stay the course, and that led to Sept. 11.\u0094","5188":"They say the Qaeda label remains useful shorthand for the news media and for officials who want to tap the powerful emotions associated with the Sept. 11 attacks. But to suggest that the terrorist threat today is represented by the organization directly commanded by Osama bin Laden is to oversimplify a complex international movement, the specialists say.","5189":"What if he produces Osama bin Laden the night before the election? Well, that won't do it. That's five years too late.","519":"Re 'Bush Orders Heavy Bombers Near Afghans; Demands Bin Laden Now, Not Negotiations' (front page, Sept. 20): The military should not reveal its plans to strike at the enemy. The public and especially Osama bin Laden do not need to know the details of our troop movements. During World War II, we had a slogan, 'Loose lips sink ships.' Can't we keep a few secrets?","5190":"In Crawford this week, Mr. Snow told reporters there were two approaches to fighting terrorism: 'And in the Connecticut race, one of the approaches is to ignore the difficulties and walk away.' He added, 'Now, when the United States walked away, in the opinion of Osama bin Laden in 1991, bin Laden drew from that the conclusion that Americans were weak and wouldn't stay the course, and that led to Sept. 11.'","5191":"Cynicism: Republicans have consistently portrayed their opponents as weak on terrorism, if not actually in sympathy with the terrorists. Remember the 2002 TV ad in which Senator Max Cleland of Georgia was pictured with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein? Now we have Dick Cheney suggesting that voters in the Democratic primary in Connecticut were lending aid and comfort to \u201cAl Qaeda types.\u201d There they go again.","5192":"WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 \u0097 Like some terrorist version of broadcast pundits, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri address the world by video or audio every few weeks, exhorting their followers to jihad, taunting their enemies and offering sometimes grandiose commentary on current events.","5193":"Mr. Mashhadani belongs to the Salafiya sect of Sunni Islam, a fundamentalist branch that counts Osama bin Laden as an adherent. In 2003 and 2004, he was a fixture at the Ibn Taimiya Mosque, a Salafist bastion near the airport that was raided several times by the American military in what it called a search for weapons and insurgents. During a previous interview there, he accused this reporter of being an operative for the Central Intelligence Agency.","5194":"But they are not waiting. A video Monday on the Web site of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee showed footage of Osama bin Laden, referred to an increase in terror attacks, highlighted illegal immigration and pointed out the nuclear aspirations of Iran and North Korea.","5196":"And one of her challengers on the right, John Spencer, is running a new commercial that juxtaposes images of Mrs. Clinton and Osama bin Laden \u2013 faintly echoing Mr. Lamont\u2019s commercial morphing Mr. Lieberman and President Bush, and more directly recalling the Republican commercial in 2002 that mixed images of Osama, Saddam Hussein, and Senator Max Cleland of Georgia. (Mr. Cleland was ultimately defeated.)","5197":"\u201cIt is not Osama bin Laden and it\u2019s not Ayman al-Zawahri but it was someone close to the rank of Abu Faraj al-Libbi,\u201d the intelligence official said, referring to the top two Qaeda leaders.","5198":"'It is not Osama bin Laden and it's not Ayman al-Zawahri but it was someone close to the rank of Abu Faraj al-Libbi,' the intelligence official said, referring to the top two Qaeda leaders.","5199":"The hyperbole that has greeted the Lamont victory in some quarters is far more revealing than the victory itself. In 2006, the tired Rove strategy of equating any Democratic politician\u2019s opposition to the Iraq war with cut-and-run defeatism in the war on terror looks desperate. The Republicans are protesting too much, methinks. A former Greenwich selectman like Mr. Lamont isn\u2019t easily slimed as a reincarnation of Abbie Hoffman or an ally of Osama bin Laden. What Republicans really see in Mr. Lieberman\u2019s loss is not a defeat in the war on terror but the specter of their own defeat. Mr. Lamont is but a passing embodiment of a fixed truth: most Americans think the war in Iraq was a mistake and want some plan for a measured withdrawal. That truth would prevail even had Mr. Lamont lost.","52":"Your claim that terrorists in South Asia, like the group said to be headed by Osama bin Laden, are 'motivated less by political grievances than by religion and ideology' is a simplistic interpretation of regional politics.","520":"Whatever the cause, it is a record that makes Pakistan wary of President Bush's new embrace. The biggest danger now is that by overstepping in Pakistan -- using it as a military base for attacks, for example -- the administration could plunge General Musharraf's regime into chaos or even civil war, providing a new opportunity for lethal action by Osama bin Laden and his radical allies. Another risk would be to embolden General Musharraf as a nuclear weapons-toting troublemaker.","5200":"Five years after the attacks of 9/11 and President Bush\u0092s promise to get Osama bin Laden \u0093dead or alive,\u0094 the mastermind of the operation is still free and issuing widely publicized video and audio threats. By contrast, the C.I.A.\u0092s unit set up to find him, code-named \u0093Alec Station,\u0094 was recently, and quietly, disbanded after 10 years of failure. In the Middle East, America has become bogged down in an endless war and occupation in Iraq while Israel, backed by the United States, is now involved in a bloody war in Lebanon. Calling the invasion of Iraq \u0093a godsend to Osama bin Laden,\u0094 the former Alec Station chief Michael Scheuer warned that American foreign policy in the region was playing directly into his hands. \u0093It validated so much of what he has said and told Muslims: that the Americans want Arab oil; that the Americans will destroy any Muslim regime that appears to be powerful; the Americans will destroy any country that appears to be a threat to the Israelis; and they\u0092re willing to invade any Muslim country if it suits their interests.\u0094","5203":"Nearly five years after American military forces help topple a Taliban government that provided sanctuary and training camps to Osama bin Laden, there is no victory in the war for Afghanistan, due in significant measure to the Bush administration\u0092s reckless haste to move on to Iraq and shortsighted stinting on economic reconstruction.","5204":"KHARTOUM, Sudan, Aug. 25 \u0097 On Sept. 12, 2001, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, the man who had once played host to Osama bin Laden, sent a message to President Bush and the American people.","5205":"The Bush spokesman Tony Snow recently told reporters that \u201cwhen the United States walked away, in the opinion of Osama bin Laden in 1991, bin Laden drew from that the conclusion that Americans were weak and wouldn\u2019t stay the course, and that led to September 11th.\u201d","5206":"KHARTOUM, Sudan, Aug. 25 \u0097 On Sept. 12, 2001, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, whose government had once played host to Osama bin Laden, sent a message to President Bush and the American people.","5207":"Reading Dexter Filkins\u0092s review of \u0093The Looming Tower,\u0094 by Lawrence Wright (Aug. 6), I was both concerned and outraged to learn that the \u0093cave-dwelling madman\u0094 Osama bin Laden is, in fact, only six feet tall.

Only here graduation day is Sept. 11, when the support Mr. Mohamed has given Osama bin Laden \u2014 smuggling him in and out of Afghanistan, writing the terrorist training manual for Al Qaeda and helping to mastermind attacks on American embassies in Africa \u2014 pays off in spectacular destruction and carnage.","5217":"8 P.M.

For example, it could finally seal its scandalously porous border with Afghanistan, making it much harder for the Taliban to infiltrate into that country the fighters killing American, NATO and Afghan soldiers. It could permanently shut down the Pakistan-based Kashmiri terrorist groups that have survived past crackdowns by reopening under new names, with little interference from Pakistani authorities. Not least, it could make a more serious effort to find and arrest Osama bin Laden, widely believed to have spent much of the past four and a half years on Pakistani soil.","5221":"The president did not go that far today. But he did liken the battle against Osama bin Laden and his followers to earlier struggles against the aspirations of Lenin and those of Hitler, \u201ca failed Austrian painter.\u201d","5223":"In one of the most obvious capitulations since it began its campaign to rout foreign fighters from the area, the government said foreigners would be allowed to stay if they respected the law and the peace agreement. Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda are believed to be among the foreigners who have taken refuge in the area.","5224":"Imam Abu Bashar, a Muslim cleric in Odense, told The Associated Press that he feared Denmark might become a terrorist target because Osama bin Laden said he would punish the countries that have troops in Iraq.","5225":"The speech employed some of Mr. Bush\u0092s sharpest rhetoric to date. He compared Osama bin Laden to Lenin and Hitler, saying, \u0093Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their intentions as clear as Lenin and Hitler before them.\u0094","5226":"In particular, some critics \u0097 including Richard A. Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar \u0097 questioned a scene that depicts several American military officers on the ground in Afghanistan. In it, the officers, working with leaders of the Northern Alliance, the Afghan rebel group, move in to capture Osama bin Laden, only to allow him to escape after the mission is canceled by Clinton officials in Washington.","5227":"Interrogation procedures used by the agency against a former aide to Osama bin Laden, Abu Zubaydah, had been \u0093tough, and they were safe, and lawful, and necessary,\u0092\u0092 Mr. Bush said. His disclosures under interrogation led to the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who in turn led U.S. authorities to other terrorists, Mr. Bush said.","5229":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: \u201cSenator Charles Schumer of New York recently published a report grading the federal government\u2019s efforts to improve domestic security since September 11, 2001. Based on what you have read in the news, as well as your own personal observations, experiences, and opinions, how would you grade (from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019) the following categories in terms of current safety and security? -ports and borders (areas of entry into the United States) -mass transit (subways, busses, and other types of public transportation) -aviation (airports and air travel) -cyberspace (e-mail and Internet) What are your thoughts on the threat of terrorism in general? Do you feel the United States is safer now than it was at the time of September 11, 2001? Why or why not?\u201d Allow students several minutes to write, and then ask them to briefly share their responses with the class. Before reading today\u2019s article, distribute copies of \u201cDomestic Security Since 9/11 Is Barely Better, Schumer Says,\u201d and have students skim the article and examine the photograph displaying Senator Schumer\u2019s \u201cReport Card.\u201d Why does the senator give the current administration such low marks for domestic security? 2. Have the class read and discuss \u201cPolitical Season Opens With Focus on Security\u201d (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20060906wednesday.html) focusing on the following questions: a. What \u201cseason\u201d began on September 5, 2006, according to the article? b. Who wrote the report, \u201cNational Strategy for Combating Terrorism\u201d? c. On what main issues regarding terrorist threats does the report focus, according to the article? d. Who spoke out against the administration\u2019s approach to terrorism and security, according to the article? e. What is the \u201cThird Way National Security Project\u201d? f. How does the report by top Democrats differ from the president\u2019s report, according to the article? g. On what point do both reports agree, according to the article? h. How has the Al Qaeda terrorist organization changed since the events of September 11, 2001? i. Who are \u201cIslamo-fascists,\u201d and who uses this expression, according to the article? j. How does the president\u2019s report address the capture of Osama bin Laden? k. What is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to the United States, according to those quoted in this article? 3. Announce to students that they will be taking part in small group discussions. Divide the class into groups of four. After ensuring that every student has a pen or pencil in hand, direct each group to walk around the classroom together. Have each group member read the statements listed below (posted on butcher paper or poster board prior to class), and then write brief responses either in agreement or disagreement: 1. Since September 11, 2001, the United States federal government has taken every step possible to make the country a safer place. 2. The fact that terrorist attacks have increased worldwide since September 11, 2001 is proof that the United States is not doing enough in its attempt to counter terrorism. 3. It is more important to fight terror abroad than at home. 4. The war in Iraq is taking away much needed resources from domestic security. 5. The United States has not done enough to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. 6. Currently, one of the greatest threats to U.S. security is the Al Qaeda terrorist organization. 7. Iran poses one of the greatest terrorist threats to the United States. 8. Senator Schumer\u2019s report is politically motivated and therefore not an objective assessment of domestic security. After responding to each of the eight statements posted, students return to their desks for small group discussions. Have groups focus on individual members with differing opinions, if possible. At the end of class, all groups convene to share their findings. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: For homework, each student writes a letter to the editor at The New York Times. Using a statement from the in-class activity they found most compelling (either to refute or support) as a point of departure, students write their thoughts on domestic security and counterterrorism since September 11, 2001. Letters may be submitted directly to The New York Times Learning Network at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/letters/submit.html.","523":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20\u2014 President Bush demanded tonight that Afghanistan's leaders immediately deliver Osama bin Laden and his network and close down every terrorist camp in the country or face military attack by the United States.","5230":"The suspects include Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, thought to be the Sept. 11 mastermind, and other close associates of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush said he had decided to \u0093bring them into the open\u0094 after years in which the C.I.A. held them without charges in undisclosed sites abroad, in a program the White House had not previously acknowledged.","5231":"In their letters, dated Tuesday, both Mr. Berger and Ms. Albright object to scenes in which they are shown adding obstacles to efforts to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. In particular, Ms. Albright said a scene in which she refuses to support a cruise missile strike against Mr. bin Laden without first alerting the Pakistani government was untrue. Ms. Albright (played by Shirley Douglas) also said the suggestion that she had alerted the Pakistani military to an imminent strike was \u0093false and defamatory.\u0094","5232":"But perhaps more significantly, a president who had rarely mentioned Osama bin Laden \u0097 who, of course, remains at large five years after Sept 11 \u0097 quoted Mr. bin Laden at length, describing his visions of a \u0093caliphate\u0092\u0092 that circles the globe.","5233":"The Arab satellite channel Al Jazeera showed today what it said was a videotape that had not been broadcast before of Osama bin Laden and some of the planners of the Sept. 11 attacks.","5234":"And the events leading up to disaster unfold like a spy thriller. The two-part narrative, which ABC is scheduled to broadcast Sunday and Monday night, follows a few men and women who took the Osama bin Laden threat seriously and devoted their careers to battling it. Many are real, like the former F.B.I. counterterrorism expert John P. O\u0092Neill, who died at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and who is played by Harvey Keitel. A few are composites, like an intrepid C.I.A. officer with the code name Kirk (Donnie Wahlberg).","5236":"\u201cMany Americans look at these events and ask the same question: Five years after 9/11, are we safer? The answer is, yes, America is safer. We are safer because we\u2019ve taken action to protect the homeland. We are safer because we are on offense against our enemies overseas. We\u2019re safer because of the skill and sacrifice of the brave Americans who defend our people. Yet five years after 9/11, America still faces determined enemies, and we will not be safe until those enemies are finally defeated.\u201d \u2026 \u201cIn order to protect this country, we will keep steady pressure, unrelenting pressure on al Qaeda and its associates. We will deny them safe haven; we will find them and we will bring them to justice. \u201d \u2026 \u201cThe fighting in Iraq has been difficult and it has been bloody, and some say that Iraq is a diversion from the war on terror. The terrorists disagree. Osama bin Laden has proclaimed that the \u201cthird world war is raging\u201d in Iraq. Al Qaeda leaders have declared that Baghdad will be the capital of the new caliphate that they wish to establish across the broader Middle East. It\u2019s hard to believe that extremists would make large journeys across dangerous borders to endure heavy fighting, and to blow themselves up on the streets of Baghdad for a so-called \u201cdiversion.\u201d The terrorists know that the outcome in the war on terror will depend on the outcome in Iraq \u2014 and so to protect our own citizens, the free world must succeed in Iraq.\u201d","5237":"Osama bin Laden must be rejoicing.","5238":"And the events leading up to disaster unfold like a spy thriller.

The overwhelming support came despite Democrats\u2019 increasing criticism of the Bush administration\u2019s handling of the war in Iraq.","524":"'Whether it's Osama bin Laden or not,' said Jeremiah McKinley, a 19-year-old sophomore pharmacy student at Florida A &amp; M University in Tallahassee, 'if the president says you have to fight, you have to fight. You have to do what your leader says.'","5240":"In Mr. Bush\u0092s version of events, there was no mention of the August 2001 intelligence report warning that Osama bin Laden was plotting to attack inside the United States. Nor was there any of his own early response, judged by his critics to have been erratic, after learning, during a visit to a Florida elementary school, that planes had crashed into the Word Trade Center.","5241":"According to the report, the C.I.A. unit given the task of tracking Osama bin Laden had intercepted a cable on Aug. 28, 2001, that revealed the alias of Mr. Mohammed.","5242":"Under growing pressure from Democrats and aides to former President Bill Clinton, ABC is re-evaluating and in some cases re-editing crucial scenes in its new mini-series \u0093The Path to 9/11\u0094 to soften its portrait of the Clinton administration\u0092s pursuit of Osama bin Laden, according to people involved in the project.","5243":"And the speeches by Mr. Bush were just one part of what Karl Rove, the president\u0092s chief strategist, told lobbyists in a private briefing this week would be a hard-charging effort that would include frequent quotations from Osama bin Laden and a warning that terrorists were out to destroy Israel and dominate the world economy through the control of oil reserves.","5244":"CAIRO, Sept. 7 \u0097 Five years ago, in the soaring mountains of Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden met with some of the men involved in planning the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.

Susan Stern Chestnut Hill, Mass., Sept. 7, 2006 To the Editor:","5249":"The TV Watch column in Weekend yesterday, about the ABC mini-series \u0093The Path to 9/11,\u0094 referred incorrectly to a conclusion of the commission that investigated the terror attacks. The commission said the accusation that President Clinton had ordered air strikes against Osama bin Laden in August 1998 to distract attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal was one of several factors that \u0093likely had a cumulative effect on future decisions about the use of force\u0094 against Mr. bin Laden. It did not conclude that the scandal distracted the Clinton administration from the terrorist threat. (Go to Article)","525":"The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics. A fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teaching of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.","5250":"At least before any late editing, the five-hour film depicts some Clinton administration officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, national security adviser, as placing obstacles in the way of strikes against Osama bin Laden.","5251":"The speeches, written by a team headed by William J. McGurn, emphasized the continuing threat represented by Osama bin Laden and went on to offer Mr. Bush\u0092s own fairly upbeat report on progress made in closing the gaps in domestic security laid bare by the Sept. 11 attacks.","5252":"By the end of the manhunt, the reward for information leading to Mr. Phillips\u0092s capture had grown to $425,000, and he had been added to the F.B.I.\u0092s 10 Most Wanted List, just three names down from Osama bin Laden.","5253":"At least before any late editing, the five-hour film depicts some Clinton administration officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K.

But a shift is happening.\u201d","5256":"This third phase leads to a reassessment, and then to a search for ways to divide the enemy and exploit the merest hint of division or ideological argument. Probably going further than this administration can yet swallow, Richardson recommends discreetly opening negotiations with Ayman al-Zawahri, the ideologist of Al Qaeda; it\u0092s known that Zawahri had gently scolded Al Qaeda\u0092s man in Iraq, the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, for killing Iraqi Shiites in order to foment a civil war. And there may be rivals of Osama bin Laden whom the administration could reach out to \u0097 in any event, it would be helpful to insert such a worrisome worm of suspicion into Al Qaeda\u0092s leadership. Richardson suggests that British intelligence was so adroit at developing informants and fomenting splits in Northern Ireland that there was a period when the I.R.A.\u0092s counterinfiltration teams killed off more of their own militants than the British did.","5257":"The locations of Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri remain unknown. But American officials suspect that they are somewhere along the border.","5258":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 \u0097 Abu Zubaydah, the first Osama bin Laden henchman captured by the United States after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was bloodied and feverish when a C.I.A. security team delivered him to a secret safe house in Thailand for interrogation in the early spring of 2002. Bullet fragments had ripped through his abdomen and groin during a firefight in Pakistan several days earlier when he had been captured.","5259":"The anniversary of the attacks by 19 Al Qaeda hijackers has brought a sharp, public, often rancorous re-examination of security policies under President Bush and even before him \u0097 an ABC-TV program suggesting that Clinton administration officials missed a chance to kill Osama bin Laden was re-edited after those officials protested forcefully that they were misrepresented.","526":"While the clues are sparse, investigators are pursuing this line of inquiry because it follows a pattern seen in previous attacks by Osama bin Laden in which a senior operative arrived on the scene to give instructions to suicide bombers. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi exile, has been identified as a prime suspect in last week's attacks.","5260":"Even terrorists don't like the label. An al-Qaeda statement put it this way: \"When the victim tries to seek justice, he is described as a terrorist.\" Many prefer to redefine the term first. In Osama bin Laden's words, \"If killing those who kill our sons is terrorism, then let history be witness that we are terrorists.\" On another occasion, when asked to respond to media claims that he was a terrorist, he replied, \"There is an Arabic proverb that says, she accused me of having her malady and then snuck away.\" Other terrorist leaders have taken a similar perspective. Abimael Guzm\u00b7n, the Peruvian academic turned leader of the Maoist Shining Path, declared, \"They claim we're terrorists. I would like to give the following answer so that everyone can think about it: has it or has it not been Yankee imperialism and particularly Reagan who has branded all revolutionary movements as terrorists, yes or no? This is how they attempt to discredit and isolate us in order to crush us.\" Shamil Basayev, the Chechen leader responsible for the Beslan school siege, among other exploits, declared, \"Okay. So, I'm a terrorist. But what would you call them? If they are keepers of constitutional order, if they are anti-terrorists, then I spit on all these agreements and nice words.\"","5261":"Five years ago, the nation rallied around a president who promised vengeance against those responsible for the atrocity of 9/11. Yet Osama bin Laden is still alive and at large. His trail, The Washington Post reports, has gone \u201cstone cold.\u201d Osama and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are evidently secure enough in their hideaway that they can taunt us with professional-quality videos.","5262":"Today, every elected official in the country will stop and remember 9/11. The president will remind the country that he has spent most of his administration fighting terrorism, and his opponents will point out that Osama bin Laden is still at large. It would be miraculous if the best of our leaders did something larger \u0097 expressed grief and responsibility for the bad path down which we\u2019ve gone, and promised to work together to turn us in a better direction.","5265":"Somewhere, Osama bin Laden must be smiling. Or at least he will be whenever his couriers deliver the next batch of press clippings.","5266":"Where is Osama bin Laden? Why has he not been brought to justice by now?","5267":"In response to complaints from former members of the Clinton Administration and their supporters, ABC edited several scenes in the film that critics said suggested Clinton officials had been negligent in their efforts to stop Osama bin Laden in the years leading up to the attacks, including historically inaccurate scenes that they said had been simply made up.","5268":"Perhaps more remarkable was the fact that this year, a number of Web sites affiliated with Al Qaeda did commemorate the day \u0097 no doubt because they knew Americans would. Osama bin Laden and his associates have generally referred to the Sept. 11 attacks as \u0093the attacks on Manhattan,\u0094 \u0093the invasion of Manhattan\u0094 or the \u0093attacks of Jumada,\u0094 the lunar month in which they occurred. But this year, a number of jihadi sites have referred instead to Sept. 11.","5269":"Some of the most controversial scenes were cut at the last minute. But the first episode, for instance, showed C.I.A. agents and the charismatic leader of Afghanistan\u0092s Northern Alliance perched outside a bin Laden camp, ready to swoop in and capture him if only Washington approved. The authorization is not granted, and the Afghan leader rails, \u0093Are there no men in Washington, or are they all cowards?\u0094 Yet neither C.I.A. operatives nor the Northern Alliance leader ever laid eyes on Osama bin Laden, terrorism experts say. The film may be referring to a proposed raid by other Afghan tribesmen that was vetoed by the C.I.A. because it had a low probability of success and was apt to harm civilians.","527":"In Indonesia, experts and diplomats say, there is reported involvement by Osama bin Laden, who has been blamed by the United States for last week's terror. An American diplomat said this week that Mr. bin Laden was tied to a serious security threat that caused the embassy in Jakarta to close for several days last fall. The embassy remains on alert.","5270":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 \u0097 Osama bin Laden\u0092s top deputy used the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on Monday to urge fellow Muslims around the world to take up arms against the United States, and he warned of new attacks by Al Qaeda throughout the Middle East.","5271":"So we helped drive the Taliban from power in Afghanistan.

If Congressional seats were allocated in proportion to popular votes, a Democratic House would be a done deal. But they aren\u2019t, and the way our electoral system works, combined with the way ethnic groups are distributed, still gives the Republicans some hope of holding on.","536":"Strong, damaging attacks would simply unify Muslim countries against us. Instead, we can use this horrific act to unify Americans and the majority of Muslims, who do not use the Koran to justify the acts of a power seeker intent on world domination. Osama bin Laden will be defeated only if his own Islamic world turns against him.","5360":"From the cardboard supports to the images cut from magazines and newspapers, the material already looks old and smoke-browned, as if it had done time in the street.

The man said Iraqi insurgents had been killed by forces under the command of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, a Egyptian. He took over from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian, who was killed in an airstrike in June.","5366":"But the only thing many Americans know about Sikhs, if they have heard of them at all, is that they look different. With their long beards and distinctive turbans, the men often resemble the images of Osama bin Laden that flash on television screens. Though Sikhs have no relation to fundamentalist Islam, their turbans and beards set off alarm bells about terrorism in the minds of many of their fellow Americans.","5367":"At first, interrogators said Mr. Hajj had shot video of Osama bin Laden during an Al Jazeera interview, but it turned out that they may have mixed him up with another cameraman of a similar name. When that assertion fell apart, the authorities offered accusations that he had ferried a large sum of money to a suspicious Islamic charity, that he had supported Chechen rebels, and that he had once given a car ride and other assistance to an official of Al Qaeda.","5368":"A few months later, I asked the F.B.I.\u2019s spokesman, John Miller, about Mr. Bald\u2019s comments. \u201cA leader needs to drive the organization forward,\u201d Mr. Miller told me. \u201cIf he is the executive in a counterterrorism operation in the post-9/11 world, he does not need to memorize the collected statements of Osama bin Laden, or be able to read Urdu to be effective. ...

This summer, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee withdrew an advertisement from its Web site displaying images of people scaling a border fence along with images of Osama bin Laden and President Kim Jong Il of North Korea. Several Hispanic groups had complained that it unfairly likened immigrants to terrorists.","537":"But Mr. Bush's demands of Afghanistan's Taliban government were expansive. The Taliban must not only turn over Osama bin Laden, he said, but must shut down all terrorist training camps and allow American inspections to make sure they have been closed. These demands are almost certainly not going to be met, and the president vowed that the 'hour is coming when America will act.'","5370":"Osama bin Laden?","5371":"\u0093History reminds us in the case of Hitler and Osama bin Laden that they said exactly what they ultimately did,\u0094 Mr. Lieberman said. \u0093He wants to wipe out Israel and he has told thousands in the town square of Tehran: Imagine a world without the United States of America.

He argues that Nazis, Communists, Wahhabists and certain orthodox Protestants, Catholics and Jews are all fundamentalists. He throws Osama bin Laden onto the fundamentalist pile, as well as the Princeton philosopher Robert George, the former presidential speechwriter Michael Gerson, William Kristol and Dostoyevsky\u0092s Grand Inquisitor (\u0093the quintessential voice of fundamentalism\u0094).

True, there are fears that North Korea might try to sell a nuke to Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. But diplomats are just as concerned that Japan might choose to build a nuclear weapon or two, that South Korea would be tempted to do the same, that China, Russia and the United States will shove against one another and that in the Middle East, Iran will accelerate its nuclear program, leading Saudi Arabia and Egypt to Google \u0093how to build the bomb.\u0094","5377":"My hat is off to Chris Wallace for demonstrating his independence, despite the attempts by Deborah Solomon to intimidate him.

He says Ms. McCaskill supports stem cell research, which he says may offer a cure for millions of Americans with degenerative diseases. This Republican advertisement shows Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, along with scenes of terrorist training camps and exploding bombs. The screen includes threatening remarks from Al Qaeda leaders, including one from Mr. Bin Laden after Sept. 11, 2001: 'What is yet to come will be even greater.'","5385":"One piece of campaign literature carried a photo of Mr. Harrison next to one of Osama bin Laden. It stated: \u201cIf you vote for Steve Harrison for Congress, or don\u2019t vote at all, here\u2019s what you will be supporting,\u201d the literature said. \u201cSteve Harrison opposes key tools in the war on terror.\u201d","5387":"A total withdrawal from Iraq would play into the hands of the jihadist terrorists. As Osama bin Laden\u0092s deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, made clear shortly after 9/11 in his book \u0093Knights Under the Prophet\u0092s Banner,\u0094 Al Qaeda\u0092s most important short-term strategic goal is to seize control of a state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world. \u0093Confronting the enemies of Islam and launching jihad against them require a Muslim authority, established on a Muslim land,\u0094 he wrote. \u0093Without achieving this goal our actions will mean nothing.\u0094 Such a jihadist state would be the ideal launching pad for future attacks on the West.","5388":"Al Qaeda and insurgents were unable to stop this progress. They tried to stand up to our forces in places like Falluja, and they were routed, so they changed their tactics. In an intercepted letter to Osama bin Laden, the terrorist Zarqawi laid out his strategy to drag Iraq\u0092s Shia population into a sectarian war. To the credit of the Shia population, they resisted responding to the horrific violence against them for a long time. Yet the persistent attacks, particularly last February\u0092s bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of Shia Islam\u0092s most holy shrines, eventually resulted in sectarian reprisals. The cycle of violence in which Al Qaeda insurgents attack Shia civilians and Shia death squads retaliate against Sunnis has sharply increased in recent months, particularly in Baghdad.","5389":"A spot in the 2002 Georgia Senate race invoked Osama bin Laden to accuse the Democratic incumbent of being weak on national security.","539":"William Safire (column, Sept. 20) is exactly right: we should use radio to get the truth directly to the Afghan people.

Imagine a succession crisis in which the Saudi government fragments and control over nuclear weapons, should the Saudis have acquired them, falls into the hands of Saudi elites who are sympathetic to Osama bin Laden, or at least to his ideas. Or Al Qaeda itself could purchase ready-made bombs, a feat technically much less difficult than designing nuclear weapons from scratch. So far, there are few nuclear powers from whom such bombs can be directly bought: as of today, only nine nations in the world belong to the nuclear club. But as more countries get the bomb, tracing the seller will become harder and harder, and the incentive to make a sale will increase.","5393":"Then what Snow did was give an abbreviated but learned-sounding tour through the history of Al Qaeda\u0092s conflict with the United States. \u0093Osama bin Laden has made it clear . . . if the United States is pushed from Iraq, it will be to the eternal humiliation of the United States,\u0094 Snow said. \u0093Bin Laden drew the conclusion when we left Somalia that the Americans didn\u0092t have what it took to stick it out.\u0094 He continued, \u0093So, as an objective assessment about the way in which bin Laden views the United States,\u0094 Cheney\u0092s saying Democratic debates over Iraq withdrawal would strengthen terrorists \u0093is a true statement.\u0094","5394":"\u0093I know some in America don\u0092t believe Iraq is the central front in the war on terror \u0097 that\u0092s fine, and they can have that opinion,\u0094 Mr. Bush said. \u0093But Osama bin Laden knows it\u0092s the central front in the war on terror.\u0094","5395":"'I know some in America don't believe Iraq is the central front in the war on terror -- that's fine, and they can have that opinion,' Mr. Bush said.

If the United States can capture Osama bin Laden and other terrorists and does not face more attacks like last week's, consumer confidence may begin to recover by the spring, he predicted.

But at a moment in history when we faced the most subtle sort of global threat, when we needed not just a willingness to use military force but a leader of real brilliance \u2014 someone who would carefully study a little-understood enemy \u2014 we got a man who actually took pride in his lack of studiousness. No surprise: Bush never once presided over a grand-strategy session to divine the nature of Al Qaeda, and he ended up lumping Saddam and every Islamist insurgent and terrorist group with Osama bin Laden. He ensured that a tiny fringe group that had been hounded into Afghanistan with no place left to go \u2014 one that could have been wiped out had we focused on the task at hand \u2014 would spread worldwide and become a generational Islamist threat.","5402":"Under that plan, Democrats would push for new policies in Iraq, including beginning the withdrawal of troops for deployment elsewhere.

He has been at the center of a debate about the Bush administration\u0092s legal tactics in fighting terrorism, his challenge occupying not only the White House but also Congress and the courts \u0097 up to the Supreme Court, which will almost certainly have to revisit the case.","543":"Such military action became more likely -- and perhaps more imminent -- after the Taliban, the militant Islamic rulers of Afghanistan, today rejected any possibility of delivering the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive with bases in Afghanistan.","5430":"Al Qaeda\u2019s Sunni roots account for its very existence. Osama bin Laden and his followers believe the Saudi Royal family besmirched the true faith through their corruption and alliance with the United States, particularly allowing U.S. troops on Saudi soil.","5431":"The root problem, as some experts see it, is the T.S.A.\u0092s reliance on IDs that are so easily obtained under false pretenses. \u0093It would be wonderful if Osama bin Laden carried a photo ID that listed his occupation of \u0091Evildoer,\u0092 \u0094 permitting the authorities to pluck him from a line, Mr. Schneier said. \u0093The problem is, we try to pretend that identity maps to intentionality. But it doesn\u0092t.\u0094","5432":"That morning official Washington, D.C. evacuated in the face of a foreign attack for the first time since the British invasion in the War of 1812. I and a skeletal staff of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) stayed behind. That night, our country's leaders had to decide whether the United States was at war. FBI officials were already making significant headway in identifying the hijackers, and it soon became apparent even in the hectic aftermath of the attacks that several were al Qaeda operatives. Headed by Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, which means \"the base\" in Arabic, had carried out deadly terrorist attacks against Americans for several years, including the bombing of two American embassies in Africa and the USS Cole in Yemen, and had failed at other, even more deadly, attempts.","5433":"The elite French troops have been deployed in southeastern Afghanistan since July 2003 to help in the fight against people believed to be linked to Al Qaeda and the Taliban and to help search for the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden.","5435":"Mr. Kerik has never been held accountable for that failure, only for less lethal and unrelated graft in New York. Paul Bremer, whose early decisions as our Iraqi viceroy all but guaranteed our defeat, received the highest civilian award from the president. So did both George Tenet, who presided over the \u201cslam dunk\u201d intelligence that sped us to war, and Gen. Tommy Franks, who let Osama bin Laden get away. Even now, no generals have been fired for their failures in Iraq; the only one to lose his job was the former Army chief of staff, Eric Shinseki, who antagonized Mr. Rumsfeld before the war by correctly warning that hundreds of thousands of American troops would be needed to secure Iraq. But never mind. That\u2019s ancient history. We can avoid confronting these morally grotesque skeletons in our closet as long as we can distract ourselves with Michael Richards\u2019s meltdown.","5436":"WITH sales soaring, the fur trade has become bolder about taking on activists \u0097 even securing Osama bin Laden-like status for antifur marauders. Last month, the industry claimed a victory when President Bush signed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, which gives federal authorities enhanced powers to prosecute animal-rights activists for certain offenses. (The act defines \u0093animal enterprise\u0094 as any \u0093commercial or academic enterprise that uses or sells animals or animal products for profit, food or fiber production, agriculture, research or testing.\u0094)","5437":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 23 (AP) \u0097 A leading Taliban military commander described as a close associate of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar was killed in an airstrike this week close to the border with Pakistan, the United States military said Saturday. A man identifying himself as a Taliban spokesman denied the report.","544":"Take the external first. The great danger here is that military attacks of too sweeping a character -- by the heavy U.S. bombers already sent to the Middle East, for example -- would play into the hands of the terrorists and their presumed leader, Osama bin Laden.","5441":"Answers (quiz appeared Sunday) 1.

He also threatened to continue the war until foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan.","5449":"The United States\u2019 full participation in a diplomatic process in the Horn of Africa, on the other hand, would constitute a relatively low-cost way of signaling a new American approach to Islam and a re-engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, which has largely been left out of Washington\u2019s post-9/11 calculus. A result could be a small political victory in the Muslim world that would deprive Osama bin Laden and his followers of a new grievance rather than supplying them with one.","5450":"Mr. Motassadeq\u2019s links to the hijackers were never in dispute. He was a friend of Mr. Atta and Mr. Shehhi while they lived in Hamburg, and had wired money to Mr. Shehhi. He also admitted to attending a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan sponsored by Osama bin Laden.","5451":"The hours of tapes played at trial revealed an angry man who raged against America, praised Osama bin Laden and predicted additional terror attacks in the United States, all while discussing his bomb plot.","5452":"The Rangers were attempting to capture key leaders of the militia loyal to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, but any connection between any of the myriad warring factions in Somalia at the time (and there were many) and Osama bin Laden\u2019s al Qaeda was, by all indications, unacknowledged \u2014 or at the very least, it was not the prime mover driving the American military operation.","5453":"According to the final report of the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks, Mr. Mohammed acknowledged under interrogation that he was a major planner of the 9/11 plot.

The Egyptian newspaper Al-Maydan noted that when the news broke that the towers were hit, \"Millions of us shouted in joy.\" There were celebrations in Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, and Jordan. Even in London, some Muslims rejoiced and Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed preached a sermon in his mosque calling September 11 \"a towering day in history\" and hailing the \"magnificent 19\" for what they did. In many parts of the Muslim world, Osama bin Laden became an instant sensation for having hit America where it hurt.

On the contrary, Osama bin Laden and his chief lieutenants were allowed to slip away and are still at large. The high command of the Taliban was also permitted to escape, and is now engaged in a ferocious counteroffensive.

The mullahs in Qom study Western philosophy from Plato to Habermas, and important reformist intellectuals within Iran have been challenging Khomeinist orthodoxy using the cosmopolitan tools of modern and postmodern thought. Contemporary Iran, the most important Shiite base today, is still shaped by an ancient Persian civilization that predates Islam.

WARM UP/DO NOW (Day 1): In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): From your knowledge of American politics, what do you think a special-interest group is? List issues that you believe special-interest groups might organize around. Name any special-interest groups of which you\u2019ve heard. 2. As a class read and discuss \u201cSpecial-Interest Groups Widening Political Attack Ads,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. Why did the Federation for American Immigration Reform (F.A.I.R.) link Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) with the terrorist Osama bin Laden? b. How did the Michigan Catholic Conference react to the advertisement linking Osama bin Laden with Senator Abraham? c. According to the article, what trend is changing the face of American political advertising? d. What is a special-interest group? e. What is the message in the advertisement that the Handgun Control organization is running in eight cities about the National Rifle Association (N.R.A)? f. According to Darrell West, a Brown University political science professor, when did interest-group ads become a \u201cgrowth industry\u201d? g. How did Harry and Louise advertising effect the Clinton administration\u2019s health care proposals? h. Who sponsored the Harry and Louise ads? i. How can candidates use special-interest group ads to their advantage? j. According to the article, the candidates in the Michigan Senate race have not yet begun advertising, \u201cin any concerted way.\u201d Yet there have been television ads present in the race. What groups have sponsored the television ads? k. The Federation for American Immigration Reform describes their advertising campaign as an effort to defeat immigration legislation. According to the article, how do many other people in Michigan view the federation\u2019s efforts? l. What is the Federation for American Immigration Reform\u2019s main platform? m. Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, says that the federation has always been \u201ccontroversial.\u201d Why? n. How does the federation frame its efforts to defeat Senator Abraham\u2019s immigration bill? o. What would Senator Abraham\u2019s immigration bill allow? p. In the article, Dan Stein, the federation\u2019s executive director, says, \u201cWe are a charitable entity.\u201d We are not interested in affecting the campaign.\u201d What does the Abraham campaign believe about this? q. The federation is a non-profit charity whose donors can receive tax deductions. What does this mean for them when it comes to political candidates and elections? r. What is electioneering? s. What is lobbying? t. As non-profit charities, special-interest groups can engage in lobbying but are barred by the Internal Revenue Service from campaigning for or against political candidates. Why is the Sierra Club given more leeway in campaigns? u. Why are charities so careful to comply with the electioneering ban? v. How has the federation\u2019s advertisements effected the way that the Abraham campaign is being run? 3. As a class, brainstorm political issues that might be taken up by special-interest groups. The list might include issues such as gun control, reproductive choice, immigration, vouchers, etc. Continue the brainstorm by creating a list of special-interest groups that the students may have heard about in the news. Discuss what makes a special-interest group (non-profit status, electioneering ban, etc.). 4. Divide students into small groups. Each group selects an issue and researches the positions of the two major presidential candidates on this issue. Students should also research the special-interest groups that have formed around this issue, noting their size, their constituency, and their messages and activities during the primaries or recent elections. 5. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK: In their groups, students should imagine that they are representatives from a special-interest group and write the transcript of a television attack advertisement, targeting one candidate about his position on one issue. (They might also include a description of the ad\u2019s graphics and sound effects.) Students should keep in mind that as a special-interest group, they may not overtly endorse one candidate over another. Students may use the transcript of the Handgun Control anti-Bush advertisement as an example. (http://handguncontrol.org) 6. WARM UP/DO NOW (Day 2): In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): From what you now know about American politics and special-interest groups, do you think that negative advertisements by special-interest groups are fair? Are they electioneering or lobbying? 7. In their groups, students re-write their advertisement in a positive way, without pointed attacks. Students may want to frame their advertisement as an educational campaign. (They might also include a description of the ad\u2019s graphics and sound effects.) They should keep in mind that as a special-interest group, they cannot overtly endorse one candidate over another. 8. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK (Day 2): In their groups, students finish their advertisements. Individually, students write a reflective essay on the process of writing the advertisements. Students should also address the question of whether special-interest groups should be allowed to continue their pointed campaigns or whether there should be legislation prohibiting their pointed campaigns. At a later date, students may present both their negative and positive advertisements to the class. Where possible, students may film their advertisements. Further Questions for Discussion:\u2013What do you think of when you hear the term \u201cspecial-interest group\u201d? \u2013Why is it so important to special-interest groups to keep their non-profit status? \u2013Are special-interest groups flouting the electioneering ban by running pointedly negative attack ads? \u2013How important do you believe advertising is in political campaigns? \u2013How do you think campaigns have changed since the advent of television advertising? \u2013What do you think an election would be like without any political advertising? Would voters have a chance to learn about the candidates? \u2013Why do you think the author of the article chose to use the term \u201cfederation\u201d when speaking of Federation for American Immigration Reform, rather than their acronym F.A.I.R.? Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and group discussions and thoughtful participation in research and advertisement creation. Vocabulary:astonishing, inveigh, infuriate, antithesis, obscure, ominous, leveling, surrogate, backlash, insulation, ostensibly, unaffiliated, acronym, concerted, virulent, ophthalmologist, moratorium, smorgasbord, hackles, severed, constituent, lobbying, electioneering, scrupulous, refuting Extension Activities:1. The article mentions a number of special-interest groups, individuals and unions by name. Research the history, membership and message of one of the organizations mentioned in the article: Federation for American Immigration Reform, Handgun Control, the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, Sam and Charles Wyly, AFL-CIO, Right to Life, Americans for Job Security. 2. Campaign Finance reform has been an important issue already this election. What has all the controversy been about? How might Campaign Finance reform effect advertising? How much may candidates spend on advertising? Do special-interest group advertisements subvert this spending cap? 3. Create a pamphlet for a special-interest group of your own invention. What messages would you need to include? What issues are you addressing? How will you entice new members to join or donate money? 4. Write a letter to the editor of your local paper about negative campaign advertising. How do you feel, as a young person, it influences your view of politics and the electoral process? 5. Interview a parent or older friend or relative about their most pervasive memory of a political advertisement. Did the advertisement affect the way they voted? What other ads do they remember? Do they remember any positive advertisements? 6. Keep a journal of political advertisements that you see in print and in the newspapers. How does coverage change as the election grows nearer? What role do special-interest groups play? 7. Television changed the way Americans look at political candidates. Who was the first candidate to appear on television? To use television advertising? How much influence do you think television has on the way candidates campaign? Create a timeline, tracing the influence of television on the American political system. Included in your timeline might be suggestions to each candidate or politician to make himself/herself more \u201ctelegenic\u201d? Interdisciplinary Connections:American History \u2013 Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to appear on television. Dwight David Eisenhower was the first candidate to make a campaign commercial. John F. Kennedy used television to his advantage.

As Ms. Rice began taking copious notes, a senior White House aide said, Mr. Bush told her that the assault on terrorism would come in phases, opening with a more focused attack on Osama bin Laden, his operation and his Afghan protectors, but eventually encompassing any terrorist operations with the 'global reach' to harm the United States, and the countries that sponsor them.","5601":"To keep the war going, the administration has brought the original bogyman back out of the closet. At first, Mr. Bush said he would bring Osama bin Laden in, dead or alive. Within seven months after 9/11, however, he had lost interest: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say he\u2019s at the center of any command structure,\u201d he said in March 2002. \u201cI truly am not that concerned about him.\u201d","5602":"Last week, President Bush asserted that in early 2005 Osama bin Laden ordered Mr. Zarqawi, his designate in Iraq, to organize terrorist attacks against the United States and other countries.","5603":"Clinton\u2019s linking of Iraq\u2019s leader and Al Qaeda, however, was unsupported by the conclusions of the N.I.E. and other secret intelligence reports that were available to senators before the vote. Indeed, the one document that supported Clinton\u2019s statement, a public letter from the C.I.A. to Senator Graham, mentioned \u201cgrowing indications of a relationship\u201d between Al Qaeda and Iraq but acknowledged that those indications were based on \u201csources of varying reliability.\u201d In fact, the classified reports available to all senators at the time found that Iraq was not allied with Al Qaeda, and that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden harbored feelings of deep mistrust and enmity for each other. A Defense Intelligence Agency report in February 2002, disclosed by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan in 2005, concluded: \u201cSaddam\u2019s regime is intensely secular and is wary of Islamic revolutionary movements. Moreover, Baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control.\u201d A C.I.A. report of June 21, 2002, partially released in 2006, said, \u201cThe ties between Saddam and Bin Laden appear much like those between rival intelligence services, with each trying to exploit the other for its own benefit.\u201d In an interview, Bob Graham said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any agency pretended to make a case that there was a strong linkage between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. It wasn\u2019t in the N.I.E.\u201d","5604":"But Mr. Diskin is careful not to speak of \u201cAl Qaeda,\u201d which he regards as losing its meaning, but only of \u201cglobal jihad\u201d the network of Islamist and anti-Western ideas associated with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","5605":"Military officials said yesterday that Mr. Amri had been a midlevel Qaeda operative with direct ties to higher-level members, including meeting Osama bin Laden, and had fought United States forces in the Tora Bora mountains.","5606":"Think about it: what would make you feel safer \u2014 Osama bin Laden and a hundred of his lieutenants dead, or a democratic Iraq?","5607":"Think about it: what would make you feel safer -- Osama bin Laden and a hundred of his lieutenants dead, or a democratic Iraq? Ari Weitzner New York, May 28, 2007 To the Editor:","5608":"To the prosecutors, Mr. Khadr is the essence of a young man who should be held to adult standards. American officials say his father, Ahmed Said Khadr, who was killed in a shootout with Pakistani forces in 2003, was a senior deputy to Osama bin Laden.","561":"KUWAIT, Sept. 22\u2014 The United Arab Emirates, one of only three countries to have recognized the Taliban government, broke off relations with Afghanistan today because of its refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden, the terror network chief suspected of masterminding the suicide attacks on New York and Washington.","5610":"MR. BLITZER: Congressman Kucinich, if you were president of the United States and the intelligence community said to you, \"We know where Osama bin Laden is, he's in Pakistan. We've got a specific target, but he's only going to be there for 20 minutes. You got to give the order, yes or no, to take him out with a HELLFIRE missile, but it's going to kill some innocent civilians at the same time,\" what would be your decision?","5611":"8:44 p.m. Mrs. Clinton has dominated a good part of the evening; witness this interesting discussion about whether to assassinate Osama bin Laden (assuming he\u2019s caught). Mr. Kucinich said he did not believe in assassination because it could come back to haunt the United States. Mr. Obama, who seemed to be making up for the first debate when he was perceived as not quick enough on the draw to say he would retaliate if we\u2019re attacked, said of Mr. bin Laden, that he would \u201ctake him out.\u201d Mrs. Clinton chimed in that her husband \u2013 who has been mentioned so often tonight that he might as well be running himself \u2014 actually DID try to take out Mr. bin Laden. When all the candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would assassinate Mr. bin Laden, Mrs. Clinton sook the lead: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to engage in these hypotheticals,\u201d she said, speaking for her colleagues on the stage. The audience responded with a big applause. 8:24 p.m. Asked what would happen if diplomacy, which Mrs. Clinton proposed in dealing with Iran, failed, Mrs. Clinton got in a much-applauded dig at Vice President Cheney, saying he\u2019s occasionally sent out on missions: \u201cThat\u2019s hardly diplomatic in my view.\u201d","5612":"In general, Mr. Obama appeared more forceful and poised than he did during the first debate, on April 26 in South Carolina. Later, even he conceded he had stumbled in answering a question about how he would respond to a terrorist attack on American soil. When asked Sunday night about how he would deal with Osama bin Laden, Mr. Obama declared, \u201cYou take him out.\u201d","5613":"Let me get this straight. First, the United States incurs the ire of Osama bin Laden and other Islamic jihadists through its military actions in the Persian Gulf and by stationing forces in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.","5614":"The military judge in Mr. Hamdan\u2019s case, Capt. Keith Allred of the Navy, said the Pentagon had failed to obtain the necessary enemy combatant classification of Mr. Hamdan, who is accused of being the Qaeda driver for Osama bin Laden.","5615":"Let me get this straight. First, the United States incurs the ire of Osama bin Laden and other Islamic jihadists through its military actions in the Persian Gulf and by stationing forces in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.","5616":"The new strategy of the coalition and the Iraqis, ably directed by Gen. David Petraeus, offers the best prospect of reversing the direction of events \u2014 provided that we show staying power. Osama bin Laden said, a few months after 9/11, that \u201cwhen people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.\u201d The United States, in his mind, is the weak horse. American defeat in Iraq would embolden the extremists in the Muslim world, demoralize and perhaps destabilize many moderate friendly governments, and accelerate the radicalization of every conflict in the Middle East.","5617":"In September, President Bush for the first time officially acknowledged the C.I.A.\u2019s secret overseas detentions, saying that the 14 prisoners then in the agency\u2019s hands had been moved to Guant\u00e1namo. A 15th so-called high-level prisoner, an Iraqi Kurd named Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, alleged to be a top aide to Osama bin Laden, was moved to Guant\u00e1namo in April after being held secretly by the C.I.A. for several months.","5618":"Pakistan has a natural affiliation with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The nation was founded by Muslim separatists and has usually had sympathies for like-minded groups. Musharraf himself allied with Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar before the 9/11 attacks, a very popular position in Pakistan, and only moved away from that alliance under threat of American attack. A return to that policy under new leadership would be disastrous to the war effort. In the first place, it would leave the Taliban and AQ as a permanent threat to Afghanistan. Much more worrisome, however, is that it leaves at least a theoretical path for terrorists to get nuclear weapons for their efforts.","5619":"The stakes for the United States are high. Osama bin Laden and other top leaders of Al Qaeda are believed to be hiding in remote tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan and regaining some of their ability to launch international attacks.","562":"Throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan and Lebanon, groups with Islamic names -- if not causes -- have been used to pursue neighboring nations' foreign policy aims, to bolster political factions or undermine the security of local people and outside investors. The Saudi government came to fear Osama bin Laden and stripped his citizenship in the hope that he would never return.","5620":"Last September, after Pakistan\u2019s army suffered heavy casualties in the isolated region, the government signed a peace treaty with tribal elders that allowed militants to operate freely in the region in return for a pledge to halt attacks and infiltration into Afghanistan. American officials say they believe that Osama bin Laden and other senior Qaeda members fled to the North Waziristan area in 2001.","5621":"MIAMI, June 21 \u2014 Over strong objections from the defense, the judge in the terrorism case against Jose Padilla ruled on Thursday that prosecutors could play parts of an old television interview with Osama bin Laden to bolster their case against Mr. Padilla and two co-defendants.","5622":"A group of clerics, the Pakistan Ulema Council, said they had given Osama bin Laden the title Saifullah, or sword of Allah, in response to the British government\u2019s decision to give Salman Rushdie, the author of \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d a knighthood. The chairman of the council, Tahir Ashrafi, said that since Mr. Rushdie, who is considered a blasphemer by many Muslims in Pakistan, had been given the title \u201cSir,\u201d then Mr. bin Laden, a holy warrior in the eyes of the council, should be given a parallel title. The gesture was a more lighthearted reaction to the honor for Mr. Rushdie than the noisy protests of demonstrators in some cities of Pakistan. On Monday, Pakistan\u2019s Parliament passed a resolution condemning the knighthood and said it should be withdrawn.","5623":"The judge in the terrorism case against Jose Padilla ruled that prosecutors could play an old television interview with Osama bin Laden to bolster their case. A15","5624":"A group of clerics, the Pakistan Ulema Council, said they had given Osama bin Laden the title Saifullah, or sword of Allah, in response to the British government's decision to give Salman Rushdie, the author of 'The Satanic Verses,' a knighthood.

The gesture was a more lighthearted reaction to the honor for Mr. Rushdie than the noisy protests of demonstrators in some cities of Pakistan. On Monday, Pakistan's Parliament passed a resolution condemning the knighthood and said it should be withdrawn.","5625":"Al Qaeda has an active presence in Yemen, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, despite government efforts to fight the terrorist network.","5626":"State prosecutors say the bombers acted on a call by Osama bin Laden to attack countries backing the American-led war in Iraq.","5627":"The British royal family is not his whole topic, but it is the centerpiece. The notorious King Farouk of Egypt is supposed to have quipped that there would soon be only the kings of spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts \u2014 plus the British crown \u2014 and he was not the sole scion of a modern ruling family to end up identified with a casino. When King George V went to war with his German relatives in 1914 (lending the expression \u201cking and country\u201d a sour taste it has never lost) there were apparently secure thrones all across Europe. No need to dwell too long on that great fall, from the stuffed two-headed eagle of the Habsburgs to the caliphate that Osama bin Laden now yearns to restore. Paxman writes \u2014 too uncritically in my view \u2014 that \u201cin the years which followed the end of their monarchies, the peoples of Russia, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece \u2014 most of the population of Europe \u2014 found themselves living under dictatorship. Better the crown is worn by a dullard than by someone who thinks he has a mission.\u201d","5628":"They have heard about a dizzying cast of characters in the radical Islamist world, from Osama bin Laden to a man nicknamed Fish-Fish, and listened to opposing views of whether Mr. Hassoun spoke in code on wiretapped calls. (One can imagine the jurors in deliberations, arguing over whether \u201ceating cheese\u201d means waging jihad or enjoying a chunk of Gruy\u00e8re.)","5629":"The target was a meeting of Qaeda leaders that intelligence officials thought included Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden\u2019s top deputy and the man believed to run the terrorist group\u2019s operations.","563":"But it is Afghanistan that President Bush, in his speech Thursday night, pledged to attack unless it delivered up the terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush warned Americans to expect 'a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have seen,' in his fight against terrorism, and it will certainly be that.","5630":"The site struck an irreverent tone that was irresistible across the Web, providing comic relief to the very serious coverage in the main news outlets. And many more than a couple hundred added to the tribute, including a poster of Osama bin Laden regretting his clash with the baggage handler.","5631":"Other American counterterrorism officials expressed similar concerns, saying that Al Qaeda and like-minded groups have recently been able to plot and train more freely in the tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistani border, where Osama bin Laden and his top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are believed to be hiding.","5632":"At a morning news conference where he released a mixed progress report on his troop buildup, Mr. Bush repeatedly invoked the threat of Al Qaeda as a reason to stick with his strategy, saying the group that he referred to as Al Qaeda in Iraq \u201chas sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden.\u201d He acknowledged that public opinion might be against him \u2014 he said that \u201csometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don\u2019t enable you to be loved\u201d \u2014 but suggested that Congress was overstepping its constitutional role by attempting to force a change of policy on him.","5634":"Defense lawyers will probably try to convince jurors that the code theory is nonsense and that the wiretapped conversations \u2014 including one in which Mr. Hassoun and Mr. Jayyousi enthusiastically discussed a CNN interview with Osama bin Laden \u2014 were innocent. There is no evidence that Mr. Padilla ever saw or discussed the interview.","5635":"But the precise relationship between the Al Qaeda of Osama bin Laden and other groups that claim inspiration or affiliation with it is murky and opaque. While the groups share a common ideology, the Iraq-based group has enjoyed considerable autonomy. Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden\u2019s top deputy, questioned Mr. Zarqawi\u2019s strategy of organizing attacks against Shiites, according to captured materials. But Mr. Zarqawi clung to his strategy of mounting sectarian attacks in an effort to foment a civil war and make the American occupation untenable.","5636":"At a morning news conference where he released a mixed progress report on his troop buildup, Mr. Bush repeatedly invoked the threat of Al Qaeda as a reason to stick with his strategy, saying the group he referred to as Al Qaeda in Iraq \u201chas sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden.\u201d","5637":"Many notable militant leaders, too, have graduated from those schools. They include George Habash, a doctor and founder of the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; the late Fathi Shikaki, a doctor and founder of Palestinian Islamic Jihad; Mahmoud Zahar and several other leaders of Hamas who trained as doctors; and Osama bin Laden, an engineer, and Ayman al-Zawahri, his No. 2 in Al Qaeda, once a practicing doctor.","5638":"Mr. Chertoff was promptly hammered for it. His admission of \"a gut feeling\" that America might be vulnerable to a terrorist attack this summer was universally ridiculed as a gaffe. He then tried to retreat, but as he did so, his dire prognosis was confirmed by an intelligence leak. The draft of a new classified threat assessment found that Al Qaeda has regrouped and is stronger than at any time since 2001. Its operational base is the same ungoverned Pakistan wilderness where we've repeatedly failed to capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive for six years.","564":"While American officials have blamed Osama bin Laden for the attacks, they are still struggling to connect him directly to the plot. Investigators believe there were many more conspirators, but despite the efforts of thousands of law enforcement and intelligence agents, the authorities have arrested only a handful of suspects in the United States.","5640":"General Lynch said his troops had promised local people that they would stay in the areas they had taken from the extremists until enough Iraqi forces were available to take over, and said this had helped sustain \u201ca groundswell\u201d of feeling against the extremists. He said locals had pinpointed hideouts of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, an extremist group that claims to ties to Osama bin Laden, that have been used to send suicide bombers into Baghdad, helped troops locate 170 large arms caches. The general also said the locals had founded new neighborhood patrol units called \u201cIraqi provincial volunteers\u201d that supplied their own weapons and ammunition.","5641":"WASHINGTON, July 17\u2014 President Bush\u2019s top counterterrorism advisers acknowledged today that the strategy for fighting Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan had failed, as the White House released a grim new intelligence assessment that has forced the administration to consider more aggressive measures inside Pakistan.","5643":"After years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq and targeted killings in Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere, the major threat to the United States has the same name and the same basic look as in 2001: Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, plotting attacks from mountain hide-outs near the Afghan-Pakistani border.","5644":"The administration, however, seized on the report and, through bald political timing, tried to use it to dampen calls for an end to Mr. Bush\u2019s catastrophic war. That required some particularly twisted logic. Ms. Townsend, for example, dismissed a reporter who asked whether the fact that Al Qaeda has regrouped in the area from which it planned the 9/11 attacks suggested that it was a mistake to divert American forces to Iraq. She said Al Qaeda headed by Osama bin Laden and the terrorists in Iraq that use the name Al Qaeda are the same.","5645":"WASHINGTON, July 17 \u2014 President Bush\u2019s top counterterrorism advisers acknowledged Tuesday that the strategy for fighting Osama bin Laden\u2019s leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan had failed, as the White House released a grim new intelligence assessment that has forced the administration to consider more aggressive measures inside Pakistan.","5646":"Adding to the deception, he said, the deputy leader in Osama bin Laden\u2019s group Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, publicly supported Mr. Baghdadi in a video and Internet statements.","5648":"Adding to the deception, he said, the deputy leader in Osama bin Laden\u2019s group Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, publicly supported Mr. Baghdadi in video and Internet statements.","5649":"\u201cEven if some of the missing persons have some link with Osama bin Laden,\u201d Mr. Siddiqui said, \u201cthey have to be treated in accordance with the law.\u201d","565":"Mr. O'Neill spent the last several years heading major investigations of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, a prime suspect in the attacks at the trade center and the Pentagon. He also investigated the bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","5650":"She\u2019ll likely be reiterating her explanation (that Osama bin Laden views Iraq as the central front in the war on terror) on CNN\u2019s \u201cLate Edition\u201d (along with Khurshid Kasuri, the Pakistani foreign minister) and \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d","5652":"After the attacks on American embassies in Africa and the U.S.S. Cole, the Clinton White House determined that invading a sovereign state to rid it of Osama bin Laden was fraught with too many difficulties. So it relied on pinprick attacks, hoping that covert actions and a cruise-missile attack on a training camp might do the trick. Only after nearly 3,000 Americans had died, did the United States invade.","5653":"Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, said that he believed that Osama bin Laden was living in the border area of Pakistan, and that General Musharraf\u2019s September agreement had backfired.","5655":"Frances Fragos Townsend confirmed on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \u201cthere are no options that are off the table\u201d for the United States in Pakistan\u2019s rugged border area, where Al Qaeda has been regrouping.

Last week, a major intelligence report concluded that the international Al Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden had successfully regrouped, probably in rugged northwest Pakistan, and that it is as strong as it has been in years.","5657":"Separately, the survey found support for terrorist tactics continuing a dramatic decline in predominantly Muslim countries, although in the Palestinian territories, a strikingly high 70 percent of those polled still support suicide bombings in some circumstances. Support for Osama bin Laden fell sharply, plummeting in Lebanon to 1 percent from 20 percent in 2003.","5658":"\u201cThe facts are that Al Qaeda terrorists killed Americans on 9/11, they\u2019re fighting us in Iraq and across the world and they are plotting to kill Americans here at home again,\u201d Mr. Bush told a contingent of military personnel here. \u201cThose who justify withdrawing our troops from Iraq by denying the threat of Al Qaeda in Iraq and its ties to Osama bin Laden ignore the clear consequences of such a retreat.\u201d","5659":"Mr. Bush has become so reckless in his own denials of reality that he seems to think he can get away with saying anything as long as he has his \u201cmain man\u201d to front for him. The president now hammers in the false litany of a \u201cmerger\u201d between Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda and what he calls \u201cAl Qaeda in Iraq\u201d as if he were following the Madison Avenue script declaring that \u201cCingular is now the new AT&amp;T.;\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem to know that nearly 40 other groups besides Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia have adopted Al Qaeda\u2019s name or pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden worldwide since 2003, by the count of the former C.I.A. counterterrorism official Michael Scheuer. They may follow us here well before any insurgents in Iraq do.","566":"Senior administration officials have singled out the ruling Taliban for harboring the terrorist camps used by Osama bin Laden and his network. Both the Taliban itself and the bin Laden forces are likely to be targets of eventual American military action, and there is strong political support in Washington for such a move.","5660":"On Friday, July 13, Michael R. Gordon and Jim Rutenberg reported on the front page of The Times that Bush\u2019s \u201creferences to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and his assertions that it is the same group that attacked the United States in 2001, have greatly oversimplified the nature of the insurgency in Iraq and its relationship\u201d with Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda, which according to a new National Intelligence Estimate (N.I.E.) has found safe haven in Pakistan.","5661":"Critics have also accused the administration of using the term \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d disingenuously in referring to Iraq, to imply that there are links between Iraqi militants and the Qaeda network led by Osama bin Laden that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, when in fact no concrete link has been shown to exist.","5662":"After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, top administration officials spoke of transforming the military to win quick military campaigns with relatively few combat troops, and become more adaptable to fight terrorist leaders like Osama bin Laden and netwroks like Al Qaeda. On Tuesday, Admiral Mullen made clear that he expected the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to impose a strain on the armed services for years to come.","5663":"But when asked by The Associated Press after a Capitol Hill breakfast with constituents whether there was any circumstance where he would be prepared or willing to use nuclear weapons to defeat terrorism and Osama bin Laden, Mr. Obama replied that \u201cThere\u2019s been no discussion of using nuclear weapons and that\u2019s not a hypothetical that I\u2019m going to discuss.\u201d","5664":"During an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Obama, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, initially ruled out using nuclear weapons in the region as part of the effort to defeat terrorism and root out Osama bin Laden.","5665":"That approach carries the message that Washington is hypocritical in its \u201cwar on terror,\u201d jailing the five for the equivalent of trying to find Osama bin Laden in his presumed haven of Pakistan.","5666":"STEPHANOPOULOS: But if your CIA director called them and said, \u201cWe had Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no,\u201d what do you do?","5667":"A spokesman for Mr. Obama, Bill Burton, said: \u201cThe fact that the same Republican candidates who want to keep 160,000 American troops in the middle of a civil war couldn\u2019t agree that we should take out Osama bin Laden if we had him in our sights, proves why Americans want to turn the page on the last seven years of Bush-Cheney foreign policy.\u201d","5668":"Nevertheless, the tale of Clinton\u2019s amazing rebound is absorbing enough to mitigate these weaknesses. The narrative gains some traction when Hamilton recounts the pivotal role of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Clinton\u2019s political resurrection. After his foreign policy blunders in Somalia and Haiti, the disaster finally enabled Clinton to assume the mantle of a strong leader with a clearly defined enemy from which he could protect the public. \u201cResponding to this, the president grew a foot taller as he began to fulfill his new role on the American stage,\u201d Hamilton writes. Oklahoma City also allowed Clinton to depict violent right-wing extremism as a natural outgrowth of the hot antigovernment rhetoric coming from angry conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, which had been undermining his presidency. It is a little-noted oddity of history that long before Osama bin Laden rescued George W. Bush\u2019s faltering first term, Timothy McVeigh did much the same for Bill Clinton. But it is not, alas, an oddity that Hamilton himself makes note of.","5669":"Mr. Giuliani got into a little dispute with Mr. Stephanopoulos, the moderator, about comments he made last week on the Charlie Rose show about going into Pakistan to capture Osama bin Laden. Mr. Giuliani said that he had said he would not take the option of going into Pakistan off the table; Mr. Stephanopoulos, quoting from the Charlie Rose transcript, said that Mr. Giuliani had said: \u201cI would take that option.\u201d","567":"Take Iran. In the 1960's the writer Jalal Al-e Ahmad identified what he called a cultural 'illness' that had stricken the country's cities and towns. He coined a new word to describe it: gharbzadegi -- 'West-stricken-ness,' or 'Westoxication.' He mourned the villager who 'in search of work flees from the village to the town so he can drink Pepsi-Cola and eat a five-rial sandwich and see a Brigitte Bardot film.' No matter that Al-e Ahmad drank alcohol and seldom prayed. The only authentic strain in Iranian culture for him was religion. His message had profound resonance. Two decades later, the elimination of 'Westoxication' was a central goal of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Now Osama bin Laden is accusing Saudi Arabia of becoming Westoxicated by allowing American military forces on its soil.","5670":"The shadow of Osama bin Laden fell across the start of the Edinburgh Fringe festival yesterday as a new show, \u201cJihad: The Musical,\u201d publicized as \u201ca madcap gallop through the wacky world of international terrorism,\u201d prompted an online protest to Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, Agence France-Presse reported.

'Among its supporters are the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.'","5680":"Mr. Turabi was a once-powerful political figure in Sudan who welcomed Osama bin Laden to the country in 1991. Faisal Islamic Bank in Sudan, a past affiliate of the trust, was a major financial sponsor of Mr. Turabi, the complaint contends. And Mr. Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic scholar from Egypt, has been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did condemn the Sept. 11 attacks.","5681":"\u201cThe Americans are killing and destroying a village just in pursuit of one person,\u201d said Mahmadullah, 24, referring to Osama bin Laden. \u201cSo now we have understood that the Americans are a curse on us, and they are here just to destroy Afghanistan.

Never heard of him? Usually this administration oversells every death of a terrorist leader. It underplayed Badri\u2019s demise for a reason. The fine print would further expose the fictional new story line that has been concocted to rebrand and resell the Iraq war as a battle against Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda \u2014 or, as Mr. Bush now puts it, \u201cthe very same folks that attacked us on September the 11th.\u201d","5687":"Like Osama bin Laden and his deputies, the Taliban had found refuge in Pakistan and regrouped as the American focus wavered. Taliban fighters seeped back over the border, driving up the suicide attacks and roadside bombings by as much as 25 percent this spring, and forcing NATO and American troops into battles to retake previously liberated villages in southern Afghanistan.","5688":"Qaeda fighters fought a fierce battle with American-backed Afghan forces in Tora Bora in December 2001. Osama bin Laden is believed to have commanded Qaeda forces in the area before fleeing into Pakistan. American officials declined to give details about the nationality or number of insurgents being attacked.","5689":"Prosecutors also played parts of a 1997 television interview with Osama bin Laden for the jury, in which he called for violent jihad against the United States. They then played wiretapped calls in which Mr. Hassoun and Mr. Jayyousi excitedly discussed the interview.","569":"Mr. Bush's administration might have been clinging to a cold-war mentality, but America's new foes in Afghanistan are clinging to a medieval mindset in a country so ravaged Clinton officials said they tried to 'bomb them up to the Stone Age' (a bombing that only succeeded in lionizing Osama bin Laden). Women are not allowed to go to school and TV's, music and even kites are banned. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of the Taliban, is reputed to be so crazed that when shrapnel hit his eye in a battle with the Russians, he simply cut it out with a knife and kept going.","5690":"But the hard line Davis took in metaphor disguised a more liberal heart, an almost tender inclusiveness. What we tend to remember as the bad-boy Oakland Raiders \u2014 the \u201cm\u00e9lange of odds and ends, oddities and irregulars, factory seconds and seeming chain-gang escapees,\u201d as the writer Mark Ribowsky put it \u2014 was in fact an early template for modern professional football. It is well known that Davis provided feed and care to troubled souls like Alzado and Matuszak. It is less well known that Davis was among the first wave of owners to scout the historically black colleges, from which he pulled, for example Art Shell, the rumbler on the left side of his offensive line. Davis could look at a castoff and see a future star, like Jim Plunkett, who had been cut by the San Francisco Forty-Niners, or Todd Christensen, a washed-up fullback whom Davis converted into a rangy tight end. If Davis was more paranoid and combative than other owners \u2014 he has sued the N.F.L. numerous times \u2014 his players looked upon him as unconcerned with reputation or conventional wisdom. \u201cThe truth of it is I\u2019d been cut twice and had tryouts for four teams,\u201d Todd Christensen told me, \u201cso he could have been Khameini or Osama bin Laden for all I cared.\u201d","5692":"Then the administration charged into Afghanistan, ostensibly in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden, and allowed the terror mastermind to get away, despite having supposedly had him cornered at Tora Bora.","5694":"Fox News is usually considered by Bush officials as a safe harbor. But Mr. Wallace had the most prickly, and probing, interview with Mr. Rove, which is not surprising; Mr. Wallace has a way of needling his guests, Republicans and Democrats alike. Last year, he goaded Bill Clinton into an angry outburst during a discussion of Osama bin Laden.","5695":"America has never had enough troops in Afghanistan, not in 2001, when Osama bin Laden was on the run in the caves of Tora Bora, and not today, when much of the country is still without effective authority. Too few ground troops have meant too much reliance on airstrikes, leading to too many innocent civilian casualties.","5696":"As a former federal prosecutor who worked on terrorism-related cases, I have had firsthand experience doing just what proponents of a national-security court say is impossible. In 2005, I prosecuted two Yemeni citizens who conspired to send money from Brooklyn to members of Al Qaeda and Hamas to support terrorist activities. Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, the main defendant in the case, boasted that he had met Osama bin Laden and previously sent both Al Qaeda and Hamas millions of dollars in assistance.","5697":"An inspector general\u2019s team that reviewed the agency\u2019s performance found that C.I.A. officers \u201cfrom the top down\u201d worked hard against Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, before the Sept. 11 attacks.","5698":"If this story sounds familiar, it is -- except for one thing. The enemy I have just described is not al Qaeda, and the attack is not 9/11, and the empire is not the radical caliphate envisioned by Osama bin Laden. Instead, what I\u2019ve described is the war machine of Imperial Japan in the 1940s, its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and its attempt to impose its empire throughout East Asia.","5699":"But two World War II veterans, John Rocca and Anthony Cellucci, said they had qualms about Mr. Bush\u2019s speech. They said they agreed with Mr. Obama\u2019s call for United States troops to refocus their efforts to find Osama bin Laden and his deputies in Afghanistan and Pakistan.","57":"The kind of global cooperation required in the future, the president said, was in evidence when the authorities foiled a plan by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile living in Afghanistan, to smuggle explosive materials into the United States before the New Year. Links between Mr. bin Laden's associates and terrorist plots uncovered in Jordan and at the United States-Canadian border have been widely reported, but the president's comments today were his most extensive on the subject.","570":"The leading suspect at the center of the terror campaign is Osama bin Laden. The bin, meaning 'son of,' is not capped; Westerners have chosen not to capitalize the Arabic just as they have often chosen to capitalize the Hebrew Ben, which has the same meaning. This has nothing to do with correctness; it is strictly idiosyncratic convention, varying among regions and stylists. (When starting a sentence with bin Laden's name, Times style calls for capitalizing it, which then looks like a mistake.) Bin Laden has been given a shorthand, bogus title, much like vice overlord, fugitive financier and drug kingpin: his is terrorist mastermind.","5700":"The C.I.A. inspector general\u2019s report on the agency\u2019s failures before Sept. 11 was devastating \u2014 but not because it showed that America\u2019s spies missed the rise of Al Qaeda. George Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, rang the Qaeda alarm. He sent a memo to the entire intelligence community saying that he wanted no effort spared in the \u201cwar\u201d with Osama bin Laden.

Depends on Who\u2019s Counting\u201d (Oct. 7): I worked out of The New York Times Baghdad bureau from November 2003 to May 2007. One of the main points you addressed, how the military defines sectarian killings, has long been a major point of contention in Iraq. Reporters there have never had a clear picture of the military definition of the term. A question at the heart of the debate is whether the military counts bombing victims, including ones from the ubiquitous car bombs, when tallying deaths from sectarian violence. You cite a military manual that says the victims of such bombings should be counted. But while in Iraq, I found that in practice, the top commanders generally did not count deaths from bombings as sectarian killings, even though it is clear to even the most casual observer of the war that the bombings are motivated by sectarian and ethnic hatreds. Rocket and mortar attacks also were not counted. Instead, at least during my time in Iraq, American commanders usually counted only people shot dead as victims of sectarian violence. The reasons are obscure. Some critics of the military say the commanders might have done this because it would be easier at some point to prove a downward trend in violence if one looked only at victims killed in shootings, rather than victims killed in shootings and bombings. The American military and Shiite-led Iraqi government have yet to find a way of ending the horrific bombings carried out by Sunni Arab insurgents. Only once did a military officer articulate the military\u2019s point of view on this issue to me. A top general in Baghdad told me the military had chosen to limit its definition of sectarian killings because it wanted to track specifically the type of violence that occurred by shooting, because some officers apparently believed that this type of killing, rather than bombings and projectile attacks, was a more accurate indicator of the level of Shiite-Sunni sectarian hatred out in the streets. Some critics have said that another reason for leaving bombings outside the definition of sectarian violence is directly related to the Bush administration\u2019s pronouncements on Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The military usually attributes large bombings to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and its spokesmen still claim that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is trying to \u201cignite\u201d or \u201cinflame\u201d sectarian civil war in Iraq rather than acknowledging that the largely Sunni Arab group is a crucial player in one side of an already raging Iraqi civil war. As you noted in an earlier column, American officials have long sought to depict Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia as an outside organization with close ties to Osama bin Laden that seeks to destroy the Sunni-Shiite \u201crelationship\u201d in Iraq. Actually, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a component of the Sunni-Shiite civil war, not an outside element. As you know, the reality is that a vast majority of members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia are Iraqi Sunnis who are trying to overthrow the Shiite-run Iraqi government. So critics of the military have asserted that the military has in practice sought to remove bombing victims from the definition of \u201csectarian killings\u201d so that bomb attacks, and their victims, would not be seen as part of an Iraqi civil war. Rather, they would be counted as part of the \u201cterrorist\u201d actions done by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which military spokesmen and Bush administration officials have for years tried to portray as an outside force, not one that is part of the internal Iraqi dynamic. In other words, whether to count bombings when measuring sectarian violence has become embroiled in the politics of defining the main narrative of the Iraq war. Critics say the less the war looks like an internal civil war and the more it looks like a front in the global jihad movement or in the Western war against \u201cIslamo-fascism,\u201d the more the Bush administration can justify its policies and the continuing American military presence in Iraq. The bottom line is that car bombs and other types of bombings, as well as rocket and mortar attacks, are major tactics in the ethno-sectarian civil war that has been unfolding in Iraq for years, and should by anyone\u2019s definition be counted as sectarian violence. Edward Wong Taipei, Taiwan, Oct. 7, 2007 \u25cf Be it 1,654, 1,280 or 827, the number of Iraqi civilians being killed every month is a horrific tragedy. These \u201cnumbers\u201d are actually human beings \u2014 mothers, fathers, sons and daughters \u2014 and this is not acceptable. Nor is the tragedy in this country acceptable \u2014 30,000 civilian deaths every year from gunshot wounds. Why isn\u2019t this number reported on a regular basis, along with the 65,000 wounded? The cost in dollars for medical care is about $15 billion annually and, the cost in human suffering is incalculable. If these figures were coming out of Iraq \u2014 2,500 Americans dead and more than 5,000 wounded a month \u2014 the war would be over. Why do we accept this casualty rate on our local streets with no discussion and little dismay while we (quite rightly) give at least some attention to civilian deaths in Iraq?

And Iran had nothing whatsoever to do with 9/11 \u2014 in fact, the Iranian regime was quite helpful to the United States when it went after Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan.","58":"Furthermore, one of the objects of the Clinton administration's attack -- the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, whom Washington suspects of masterminding the embassy bombings -- is also a nemesis of Russia.

The force is composed largely of Iraqi insurgents and is believed to be foreign-led, according to American intelligence sources, but its ties to Osama bin Laden are unclear at best.","5802":"Governor Romney misspoke twice on the same day confusing your name with that of Osama bin Laden.

By the United Nations\u2019 latest count, there were 28.","5804":"Back in September, General David Petraeus reported a slide in violence that had some impressed and others saying that it might be a fluke. About two months later, many more are acknowledging progress, and Osama bin Laden sounds like one of them.","5806":"Oh!

More than that, the bearded men of the Taliban have challenged America to a fight.

Advisers to Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and President Bush agree that it helped put the incumbent over the top, feeding into his message that it is a dangerous world.","5812":"Mr. Specter suggested that if the Pakistani government further loses control over the rugged border region with Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding, the administration should consider \u201cunilateral action\u201d against al-Qaeda and Taliban targets there.","5813":"A poll in September by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based nonprofit group, showed that Osama bin Laden was more popular in Pakistan than General Musharraf, with 46 percent of respondents giving him a \u201cfavorable\u201d rating against 38 percent for the president.

We do not know exactly where or how this money has been spent, but it is clear that it has not brought about the defeat of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, nor succeeded in capturing Osama bin Laden, nor has it broken the opium trade. It certainly has not succeeded in improving the quality of life of the children and families of Pakistan.","5816":"What does it say when a leader tells his people he must suspend their civil rights in order to combat extremism, then locks up judges, lawyers and human rights activists \u2014 society\u2019s most moderate forces \u2014 while Osama bin Laden and the Taliban run free? And what are those oppressed people supposed to conclude when the reaction of the world and even some of their own leaders is grudging?","5818":"In the days since, the coup in Pakistan has been almost universally condemned as the climactic death knell for Bush foreign policy, the epitome of White House hypocrisy and incompetence. But that\u2019s not exactly news. It\u2019s been apparent for years that America was suicidal to go to war in Iraq, a country with no tie to 9/11 and no weapons of mass destruction, while showering billions of dollars on Pakistan, where terrorists and nuclear weapons proliferate under the protection of a con man who serves as a host to Osama bin Laden.","5819":"General Musharraf dismissed such possibilities in 2005. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that they can ever fall in the hands of extremists,\u201d he said, relaxed and confident, as he was filmed for a New York Times documentary, \u201cNuclear Jihad: Can Terrorists Get the Bomb?\u201d But over the years he has said many things that turned out to be too optimistic, including a declaration at the White House that Osama bin Laden was probably dead.","582":"For those of us watching on television, everything in the last few days has been a disaster movie, complete with explosions, heroes, tragic final phone calls and death. But this movie lurches forward without direction, and for a simple reason: it is missing a worthy monster. In 'King Kong,' we can see the ape on the building, but the monster in our current story is only a rumor. He takes no credit, and we lack an understanding of his motive. We see Osama bin Laden on videotape, always dubbed or narrated, with his spiritually placid eyes, and he is never explained, nor does he explain. Everything about him is vague: his domicile, his army, the source of his power.","5820":"In the gym at the NATO base in Kabul, U.S. soldiers hit the treadmills every morning and gaze at TV screens broadcasting Al Jazeera\u2019s English news channel. When Osama bin Laden makes news, as he did recently with a statement about Iraq, America\u2019s finest work out beneath the solemn gaze of their most wanted enemy.","5821":"In acknowledging one of his first major reversals as governor, Mr. Spitzer hit a few familiarly pugilistic notes, lashing into critics who, Mr. Spitzer said, \u201cequated minimum-wage, undocumented dishwashers with Osama bin Laden.\u201d He also said he still believed his proposal would have benefited New Yorkers, citizens and immigrants alike, and lit into federal officials for failing to fix the nation\u2019s immigration system at the national level.","5823":"In acknowledging one of his first major reversals as governor, Mr. Spitzer did not spare his harshest critics, who he said had inflamed the debate with anti-immigrant rhetoric that \u201cequated minimum-wage, undocumented dishwashers with Osama bin Laden.\u201d He also said he still believed his proposal would have benefited New Yorkers, citizens and immigrants alike, and lit into federal officials for failing to fix the nation\u2019s immigration system.","5824":"The plan, Mr. Lungren charged, would tie the hands of the N.S.A. and give \u201cgreater protection to Osama bin Laden than an American citizen\u201d by preventing intelligence officials from disseminating intercepts that had been inadvertently collected.","5825":"A better word for the defector, in fact, was \u201cfabricator.\u201d With marvelous chutzpah, the source had made it all up. He had landed in Munich in November 1999 looking for asylum and wound up in the grim Zirndorf holding center. He wanted an immigrant visa and money. So, drawing on bits and pieces of his personal experience and a lot of reading on the Internet, he persuaded the German Federal Intelligence Service that he had information it coveted. The United States Defense Intelligence Agency, which got summaries of the German reports but no transcripts, code-named the source \u201cCurve Ball.\u201d The Germans warned the Americans he might be unreliable but would not let any American intelligence officer interview him. After 9/11, as the Bush administration focused its \u201cwar on terror\u201d against Saddam Hussein as well as Osama bin Laden, and despite all the warning signals, the Central Intelligence Agency bought into Curveball sight unseen. Its experts in weapons of mass destruction endorsed his deception as truth. The skeptics within the agency were ignored.","5826":"Mr. Bush has repeatedly called Gen. Musharraf \u201ca friend.\u201d In 2003, the president invited the general to Camp David, a presidential perk reserved for the closest of allies. Last year, at the general\u2019s insistence, Mr. Bush risked a trip to Pakistan, jangling the nerves of the Secret Service by spending the night in the country presumed to be home to Osama bin Laden.","5827":"While Ms. Townsend\u2019s tenure saw no major terror attacks on United States soil, it also yielded scant progress in fighting the Al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan, a failure that Ms. Townsend acknowledged this summer. Even before the latest political crisis in Pakistan, a vital ally, American officials were expressing doubts that the government of General Pervez Musharraf was losing the fight in the rugged northwest region where Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding.","5828":"As this debate proceeds, Mr. Bush and his allies will tell Americans that these reforms \u2014 and the Democrats \u2014 will make it impossible to eavesdrop on Osama bin Laden. That\u2019s not true. American intelligence has most of the tools it needs to do that already, and the Democratic bills give them the few extra ones they may be missing. Mr. Bush will present Americans with a false choice between effective intelligence and protecting their freedoms. It is possible, quite easily, to have both.","5829":"The Republicans delighted in another flip-flop. Six weeks later, Mr. Kerry gave a speech at New York University declaring that he would not have voted for the war, calling it a \u201cprofound diversion\u201d from the real threat, Osama bin Laden. Mr. Edwards had argued against the speech in a conference call into the early morning hours. While Mr. Kerry was hailed for showing resolve, the campaign never fully recovered from the accusation that the Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 unlike Mr. Bush \u2014 did not know what he stood for.","583":"Certainly, it seems to me that the idea of an enormous intelligence breakdown is ludicrous; again, this was not like a book, not like a movie; this was men armed with nothing but knives and box cutters relying on simple speed to keep people off balance long enough to accomplish their goals. In the case of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, they failed. With the other three, however, they succeeded quite nicely. Cost of weaponry? Based on what we know now, less than $100. This qualifies them as cut-rate, low-tech, stealth guerrillas flying well under the radar of American intelligence. We must realize this and grasp an even more difficult truth: although it is comforting to have a bogyman, and every child's party needs a paper donkey to pin the tail on, this Osama bin Laden fellow may not have been the guy responsible. It wouldn't hurt to remember that the boys who shot up Columbine High School planned to finish their day by hijacking a jetliner and flying it into -- yes, that's right -- the World Trade Center. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris weren't exactly rocket scientists, and the guys who did this didn't have to be either. All you had to be was willing to die, and these guys were. It could happen again. And now that crazos the world over see that it's possible to get 72 hours of uninterrupted air time on a budget, it will almost certainly happen again.","5830":"They contend that all of the detainees either are suspected of insurgent activity or are an \u201cimperative threat\u201d to security. Some American officials also believe that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown insurgent group that claims a loose allegiance to Osama bin Laden, may by itself have as many as 10,000 members in Iraq.","5831":"And Al Qaeda knows it went too far, which is why, as David Ignatius pointed out in The Washington Post, Osama bin Laden, in a little-noticed Oct. 22 audiotape, scolded his followers for tactics that had alienated Iraqis. \u201cMistakes have been made during holy wars,\u201d bin Laden said.","5832":"If there is one outlet for the neighborhood\u2019s wellspring of male energy, it is soccer. In the summer, hundreds of boys gather on bleachers to watch as players glide across a worn, concrete pitch, some of them barefoot. Sitting around the bleachers one afternoon in July, a group of teenagers talked to me about their heroes. They said they worshipped Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, the Muslim of Algerian descent who conquered the soccer world from France. They loved the Prophet Muhammad. The mere mention of Osama bin Laden elicited a sea of upturned thumbs.","5833":"Mr. Clinton became angry, complaining that Pakistan had promised but failed to bring Osama bin Laden to justice from Afghanistan, Mr. Riedel recounted.

At his trial, Mr. Trabelsi said that he had met Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and that he intended to kill American soldiers.","5867":"At the same time, militant Islam has also found a foothold. A sizable, largely poor Muslim population concentrated along the coast \u2014 and proximity to the volatile states in the Horn of Africa, including Somalia and Sudan \u2014 have made Kenya especially vulnerable, in the views of counterterrorism experts, to the call for jihad. Since the early 1990s, the mosques of Mombasa and other towns have resonated with militant Islamic rhetoric. Radical imams have preached violence against Westerners, attacked the Kenyan government as the lackey of the United States and Israel and called for the implementation of Shariah. Members of the Qaeda cells that blew up the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998, were recruited in mosques near the Indian Ocean beaches where hundreds of thousands of Western tourists flock each year. Kenya is \u201ca good place\u201d for militant Islamists to blend in, I was told by Al Amin Kimathi, the director of the Muslim Human Rights Forum in Nairobi, which accuses the Kenyan government of discrimination against the country\u2019s roughly four million Muslims (in a total population of 37 million).

By focusing on the 19 suspected hijackers, investigators have traced a network of links to Mr. bin Laden, leading back through operatives in the United States and abroad.","5870":"Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, spent the day asserting their own personal expertise: their private conversations with Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Musharraf, their visits to Pakistan and their concerns about fallout affecting the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","5871":"In seeking the recent control order, the Australian government adopted the view that Mr. Hicks was a threat to national security. Among the evidence the government introduced were letters he had written to his parents when he was in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Those include a smaller number of hard-core Arabs, like Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda\u2019s second in command, as well as a larger number of Uzbeks, Tartars and Tajiks who have influence them to take on new agendas, Pakistani security officials familiar with the region said.","5874":"In an audiotape released Saturday, Osama bin Laden urged Iraq's Sunni Arabs not to join the Awakening Councils.","5875":"Talk about prestigious and prominent bylines: the table of contents of one new publication includes Thucydides, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Osama bin Laden, Pope Urban II, Lenin ...and Lewis H.

In the message, the leader of Al Qaeda spoke disparagingly about the Awakening Council, an American-organized security force of more than 70,000 Sunni Arabs who have renounced Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown Sunni insurgent group that American intelligence says is led by foreigners.","5877":"In the speech Mr. Giuliani, who has seen his standing in the polls erode both here and nationally, continued to amp up the way he speaks about terrorism and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which brought him to national prominence. In it he quoted Osama bin Laden, warned of the dangers of the world, and said suggested a new name for the current generation of Americans: \u201cI think it wouldn\u2019t be unfair to describe us as the 9/11 generation, because how we handle this is going to say something about us in history.\u201d Standing in front of a giant American flag, and below a museum display of mannequins of soldiers surrounded by sandbags, Mr. Giuliani said that he believed the country could double the size of its forces using its present resources, but called for expanding the military to be able to deal with other challenges as well.","5878":"An enemy without borders. Hate without boundaries. A people perverted. A religion betrayed. A nuclear power in chaos. Madmen bent on creating it. Leaders assassinated. Democracy attacked. And Osama bin Laden still making threats. In a world where the next crisis is a moment away.","5879":"In December, the insurgent group stepped up attacks against the Awakening Council in Diyala to about one a week, according to United States military officials. On Saturday, jihadist Web sites posted an audio recording of the Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, also a Sunni, calling Awakening Council members \u201cinfidels\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d for siding with the Americans. The extent of the insurgent group\u2019s links to Mr. bin Laden\u2019s network is unclear.","588":"Members of the Saudi royal family are also taking seriously threats against their rule from Osama bin Laden, an outcast from one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent families. From exile he has called on Muslims to overthrow the monarchy for allowing in 'infidel' forces.

Al Jazeera has often been accused of helping make Mr. bin Laden into a celebrity, and indirectly helping him to recruit more people across the Arab and Islamic world to his cause.","5884":"But the judge granted a defense request to keep another video under seal. Prosecutors charge that the second video was a \u201cjihadist recruitment video\u201d passed by the defendant Mohamed Shnewer to another inmate. Judge Kugler said that the video, which the government said was seized from Mr. Shnewer\u2019s computer, was \u201cinflammatory\u201d and contained images including the destroyer Cole, Osama bin Laden and people who were \u201ckilled or maimed.\u201d","5885":"At the time he started, in 2004, Al Jazeera was still being reviled and celebrated around the world for its willingness to show videos of Osama bin Laden, what appeared to be its sympathy for Iraqi insurgents and its gory footage of Iraqi war victims. Mr. Rashed was hired to take Al Jazeera on and provide a new direction for journalism in the region.","5886":"BRIAN ROSS: (From videotape.) After more than six years of trying, the United States still does not have a reliable way to spot nuclear material that terrorists might smuggle into the country. Watch as ABC News twice did in demonstrations without being caught, and after six years of trying the United States has yet to capture the man who says it his religious duty to get nuclear weapons, Osama bin Laden. And in the last 18 months U.S. officials say his al Qaeda has regrouped using safe havens along the Pakistani border to train and dispatch hundreds of new recruits. And just as troubling, amidst all the turmoil in Pakistan, the influence of bin Laden continues to grow there, a country with many nuclear weapons. Charlie?

No, says Mr. Obama. Strike when we have actionable intelligence. Mr. Edwards says more forcefully, \u201cIf I knew where Osama bin Laden was, I would go get him.\u201d But, he says, the real problem with United States policy is that it is ad hoc. Mrs. Clinton offers an analysis and says she has a five-point plan for an approach to Pakistan \u2014 be sure America doesn\u2019t \u201cignite\u201d a dangerous situation. She seems to be trying to supply an awful lot of detail, thereby suggesting that Mr. Obama lacks her depth on the subject.","5888":"Osama bin Laden is hardly the first of them. Consider the assassins of Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president who made peace with Israel in 1979. His murderers\u2019 manifesto tried to justify Sadat\u2019s killing with Shariah reasoning. Their case was weak \u2014 and they knew it. So they turned themselves into tabloid terrorists, exploiting emotion, inflating language and sensationalizing their target\u2019s crime.","5889":"In part, the White House discussions may be driven by a desire for another effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri. Currently, C.I.A. operatives and Special Operations forces have limited authority to conduct counterterrorism missions in Pakistan based on specific intelligence about the whereabouts of those two men, who have eluded the Bush administration for more than six years, or of other members of their terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, hiding in or near the tribal areas.","589":"Before striking the seat of the Taliban government and Osama bin Laden's suspected hiding places in Afghanistan with bombs, ensuring the hatred of Afghans and other Muslims, let's drop food and news to win their hearts and minds.","5890":"But who is that enemy? It's not Osama bin Laden. Our enemy is a spiritual enemy because we are a nation of believers. You go back and look at our history, and you will find that we were founded on faith. Look at what the writers of the Constitution said. We are a nation of believers. We were founded on faith. And the enemy that has come against our nation is a spiritual enemy. His name is Satan. And if you do not believe that Satan is real, you are ignoring the same Bible that tells you about God. Now I'm a warrior. One day I'm going to take off this uniform and I'm still going to be a warrior. And what I'm here to do today is to recruit you to be warriors of God's kingdom.","5891":"While the underlying motives of terrorists are manifold and complex, American foreign policy has often been one of their complaints. From very early on, Osama bin Laden said one of his goals was getting the United States to remove its military presence from Saudi Arabia, home to Islam\u2019s holiest shrines.","5892":"Mr. Giuliani\u2019s campaign has been marginalized in recent weeks. Efforts to inject itself into the news cycle \u2014 including the release of a television commercial featuring Osama bin Laden and the smoldering wreckage of the World Trade Center \u2014 have had mixed results and been largely overshadowed by the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Giuliani plans to unveil his tax proposal in Florida this week \u2014 after New Hampshire, whose Republican voters are widely known as tax-averse, has voted.","5893":"\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Osama bin Laden; any action against him will be free, if we know where he is, if we have good intelligence,\u201d Mr. Musharraf told The Straits Times of Singapore. \u201cThe methodology of getting him will be discussed together, and we\u2019ll attack the target together.\u201d","5894":"To prevent the idea of terrorism from prejudicing the trial, Judge F.

The cost of these plots suggests that putting Osama bin Laden and other international terrorists out of business will require more than diplomatic coalitions and military action. Washington and its allies must also disable the financial networks used by terrorists.","5900":"Pakistan is fast evolving into the same drug-financed chaos, financing Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, which Afghanistan has already become. Afghanistan supplies 92 percent of the world\u2019s heroin-producing opium, and Pakistan now transports a growing 36 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s illicit opium, according to a State Department report last year.","5901":"Early in 2006, Greenhouse wrote an article about briefs filed in support of an appeal by a prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, a man who was once a bodyguard and driver for Osama bin Laden.

And he happens to be Greenhouse\u2019s husband.","5902":"Remember September 2006? It was a little over a month before Election Day when Bill Clinton gave an interview to Fox News Channel\u2019s Chris Wallace. The peg for the interview was a summit held by the Clinton Global Initiative, one of the former president\u2019s many philanthropic activities. Wallace asked several questions about the initiative, but four minutes into the interview also brought up criticisms of the Clinton administration\u2019s counterterrorism policies that had been aired in Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Lawrence Wright\u2019s history of Al Qaeda, \u201cThe Looming Tower.\u201d Whereupon Clinton went \u2026 ballistic. His face turned red. His voice rose. He tore into Wallace, accusing the veteran journalist, who over the decades has worked for several \u201cmainstream\u201d networks and whose credibility seldom has been questioned, of being a right-wing shill. He claimed the \u201cneocons\u201d who now say he did too little to capture or kill Osama bin Laden had in fact during the 1990s been highly critical of his administration\u2019s emphasis on counterterrorism, that they \u201cthought I was too obsessed with bin Laden\u201d and \u201chad no meetings on bin Laden for nine months after I left office.\u201d","5903":"The White House\u2019s desire to find Osama bin Laden continues to be strong, with reported plans for a new covert push within Pakistan emerging in The New York Times earlier this month. But the leader of that country, President Pervez Musharraf, sounds sick and tired of hearing about the Al Qaeda chief.","5904":"American and Iraqi officials blame Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for most of the killings, which spiked after the Dec. 29 release of an audio recording in which Osama bin Laden called the volunteer tribesmen \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201cinfidels.\u201d While the organization is overwhelmingly Iraqi and Sunni, American military officials say it has foreign leadership, though its links with Mr. bin Laden himself are unclear.","5905":"Osama bin Laden\u2019s son is now doing TV shows.

He says, \u201cDad is very sorry about that whole attack thing.\u201d Well, that\u2019s good enough for me.","5906":"When President Pervez Musharrraf sniffed at the importance of Osama bin Laden and his deputy on Wednesday, it didn\u2019t seem to be anything personal. There were simply bigger threats to handle right now, he said, namely the Islamic militants operating in the tribal areas out West and assassinating opposition leader Benzir Bhutto.","5907":"When I saw the posters announcing his imminent return, I wondered whom he would be fighting this time. In \u201cRambo: First Blood Part II,\u201d the cumbersomely titled centerpiece of the earlier trilogy, he went back to Vietnam to collect payback both from the Communists and, indirectly, from the pusillanimous desk jockeys who supposedly messed up that war the first time around.

And they each spoke of a need for more economic development in Afghanistan and more accountability with regard to aid sent to Pakistan.","5909":"It is now up to the House to protect Americans\u2019 rights. Mr. Bush has already started issuing the ritual claims that if his bill is not passed instantly, Osama bin Laden will be telephoning his agents in the United States and no one will know. Let us be clear, Mr. Bush has always had the authority to order emergency wiretaps \u2014 and get court approval after the fact. That has never been the problem with FISA.","591":"All six countries have sizable expatriate populations from less privileged Arab countries who often identify with the Palestinian cause and even with the Saudi-born refugee, Osama bin Laden, who is the prime suspect in the attacks.","5910":"Terrorism is right outside the door.

One of the things a lawyer does before accepting a case is to perform a conflicts check. We check to determine whether we have cases pending against the client that is asking us to represent its interests. And we determine whether any of our existing clients may have litigation against that client or has a standing objection to us representing that party. If so, the conflict is disclosed to the client(s), and if waivers cannot be obtained, then the representation cannot be accepted. It seems to me that anyone who writes for a newspaper needs to do a similar analysis before she decides to embark on a series such as the kind undertaken by Linda Greenhouse. Given the length of the articles, a box at the beginning of the article disclosing the relationship between Ms. Greenhouse and her husband, Eugene Fidell, should have been provided. The reader could then decide whether to bother reading the story. I have reviewed several of Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s articles and I suppose we will have to disagree on the issue of bias in Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s approach. Knowing now that she is married to a legal advocate for someone who was a driver and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden makes it clear to me why she chose to highlight certain legal positions being taken by the prisoner\u2019s legal team and to play down the administration\u2019s perspective as discussed in their responsive briefs.

But on the day of Berger\u2019s first visit, the few out-of-town visitors who did not have special permission to enter the archives were turned away. The building had been closed to the public for months, undergoing a $125 million renovation. The pair of 6.5-ton bronze doors at the public entrance were locked tight. The archives\u2019 most precious documents \u2014 the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights \u2014 had been removed from their display cases in July 2001 and placed in storage at a secret location as part of the renovation. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the archives was in no hurry to return them to public view, since the building was considered a potential target if al-Qaeda carried out a second wave of attacks. The new goldplated titanium display cases being built for the documents would seal the Declaration, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights in argon gas beneath layers of bulletproof, bombproof glass, protecting them from anything that Osama bin Laden\u2019s terrorist followers might have in mind.","5922":"According to transcripts released by the Pentagon, the United States military charged, among other things, that Mr. Hekmati was \u201chigh in the Al Qaeda hierarchy,\u201d acted as a smuggler and facilitator for it, and was \u201cpart of the main security escort for Osama bin Laden.\u201d He was also accused of attending a terrorist training camp near Kandahar and of involvement in assassination attempts against Afghan government officials.","5924":"Mr. McCain, who was joined by his wife and 95-year-old mother, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, gave a hawkish speech and drew cheers by telling the crowd, \u201cIf I have to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, I will find him.\u201d","5925":"The director, Mike McConnell, told lawmakers that Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, remained in control of the terrorist group and had promoted a new generation of lieutenants. He said Al Qaeda was also improving what he called \u201cthe last key aspect of its ability to attack the U.S.\u201d \u2014 producing militants, including new Western recruits, capable of blending into American society and attacking domestic targets.","5926":"But I agree with him on doing whatever it takes to be successful in Iraq, and finding and executing Osama bin Laden.","5927":"The budget document said that several suspects on the administration\u2019s list were expected to be captured \u201cin the near future,\u201d so the department asked for $12 million, rather than the $6 million budgeted this year. Who are the authorities about to bag? The budget doesn\u2019t say, of course, but one can infer from the totals involved and the fact that the bounties on the heads of Osama bin Laden and his deputy are each \u201cup to $25 million\u201d that the department has less prominent villains in its crosshairs than those two.","5928":"The charges, to be filed in the military commission system at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, would involve as many as six detainees held at the detention camp, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the former senior aide to Osama bin Laden, who has said he was the principal planner of the plot.","5929":"\u201cAfter Columbine and 9/11, the parents were very upset,\u201d Captain Bonfante said. \u201cThey wanted the schools shrink-wrapped. I\u2019m sure Osama bin Laden is not coming to Old Bridge for one of our schools, but we recognized we needed an improved safety system for the kids.\u201d","593":"CAIRO, Sept. 23\u2014 Among top lieutenants to Osama bin Laden, several are Egyptians, including a surgeon from Cairo who ranks second in the hierarchy of Mr. bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, and is seen by some intelligence experts as his most likely successor.","5930":"One official who had been briefed on the war-crimes case said the charges were expected to be lodged against six detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo, including Mr. Mohammed, who is said to have presented the idea of an airliner attack on the United States to Osama bin Laden in 1999 and then coordinated its planning.","5931":"General Hartmann said Mr. Mohammed is believed to have presented the idea of an airliner attack on the United States to Osama bin Laden in 1999 and then coordinated its planning.","5932":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Long before Osama bin Laden founded Al Qaeda and initiated the Sept. 11 attacks against the United States, Imad Mugniyah was perhaps the world\u2019s most feared terrorist.","5933":"The Taliban franchise that has battled the army for months in the Swat Valley is held by an outfit whose founder marched thousands of local youths to their death in a campaign in Afghanistan in 2002. Upon returning, he virtually solicited his own arrest by Pakistani authorities to escape the vengeance of the victims\u2019 families. The group is now led by one \u201cMullah Radio\u201d who, armed with an FM station, preaches that polio vaccinations are a Zionist plot and that the 2005 earthquake was retribution for a sinful existence. A worrisome crank, yes, but hardly Osama bin Laden.","5934":"After the 2001 attack on the Pentagon, Mr. McWethy kept reporting live from a nearby lawn, Mr. Westin said. Afterward, he reported from Tora Bora in Afghanistan on the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","5935":"Abdul W. Azimi, a meat slicer in Portland, Me., sued his employer, Jordan Meats, for what an appeals court called \u201cmyriad and outrageous\u201d mistreatment. Mr. Azimi found pieces of pork in his jacket, a picture of Osama bin Laden in his locker and his shoes in the toilet. A Maine jury ruled in his favor but awarded him no damages, leaving him with only a judicial declaration that his employer had violated the law.","5936":"It is Ms. Bhutto\u2019s contention in this book that dictatorship breeds extremism and that democracies \u2014 and here, she sounds a lot like President Bush \u2014 \u201cdo not go to war with democracies\u201d and \u201cdo not become state sponsors of terrorism.\u201d She quotes passages from the Koran in support of her argument that Islam preaches tolerance and pluralism (\u201cYou shall have your religion, and I shall have my religion\u201d), and she compares Osama bin Laden\u2019s \u201cattempt to exploit, manipulate and militarize Islam\u201d to terrorist acts committed by other religious fanatics: \u201cwhether Christian fundamentalists\u2019 attacks on women\u2019s reproductive clinics or Jewish fundamentalist attacks on Muslim holy sites in Palestine.\u201d","5937":"Parviz Khan, the Birmingham man who pleaded guilty last month to plotting to kidnap and behead a British Muslim soldier, was sentenced to life in prison. Described by witnesses as a keen cricketer and pubgoer until contacts with Islamic militants radicalized him on a trip to Pakistan, he was ordered to serve at least 14 years for the plot, and for supplying militants in Afghanistan with money and equipment. The plot was uncovered by Britain\u2019s security services. In secret recordings played in court, Mr. Khan was heard teaching his 5-year-old son to carry out a beheading. \u201cHow do you cut them with a knife?\u201d he said to the boy. \u201cShow me. Like this.\u201d At another point, he asked the boy, \u201cWho do you love?\u201d The boy replied, \u201cI love Sheik Osama bin Laden.\u201d Mr. Khan then asked, \u201cWho do you kill?\u201d The boy\u2019s reply: \u201cAmerica kill. Bush I kill, and Blair kill.\u201d","5938":"Here is another apology for the list: on Monday, an image of Osama bin Laden appeared over Mr. Matthews\u2019 shoulder during an introduction to a segment about Barack Obama, TVNewser notes. Mr. Matthews apologized fifteen minutes later.","5939":"Susan Rice, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama, responded that Mr. McCain was seriously distorting Mr. Obama\u2019s words. In a speech last summer at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, Mr. Obama said that if elected president, he would act if he had information that terrorists were in Pakistan\u2019s border area, thought to be a hiding place for Osama bin Laden.","594":"In Afghanistan, reports indicated that the Taliban government that has harbored Osama bin Laden was beginning its own preparations for war, ordering troop reinforcements along the border with Pakistan, building new bunkers and installing antiaircraft batteries.","5940":"The question of what to do next in Pakistan is likely to preoccupy the Bush administration in its last year. Officials say there is clear, if unstated, pressure to make a last effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden before Mr. Bush leaves office. But several senior officials in the State Department have been warning that the administration\u2019s full-scale backing of Mr. Musharraf was a wrong-headed strategy that could now blow up.","5941":"Sudan\u2019s relationship with the West has been troubled ever since Omar al-Bashir seized power in 1989 and embraced militant Islam, playing host to a variety of jihadists, including Osama bin Laden. The relationship hit its lowest in 1998 when the Clinton administration bombed a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory it claimed was producing chemical weapons, though the allegation has never been proved.","5942":"Fouad Mourtada, a 26-year-old engineer, was sentenced by a Casablanca court to three years in prison for creating a fake profile of the king\u2019s brother on Facebook, the Internet social networking site, the official news agency MAP reported. He was accused of \u201cvillainous practices\u201d and of stealing the identity of the crown prince, Moulay Rachid. The case has ignited the Moroccan blogosphere, which used it as a prime example of deteriorating freedom of expression in the North African kingdom. Hundreds of prank profiles exist on Facebook, for everyone from President Bush to Osama bin Laden. At least four fake Moulay Rachid Facebook pages have now been set up, apparently from the safety of overseas. The defense said it would appeal the sentence, MAP reported. MAP announced at the time of Mr. Mourtada\u2019s arrest that no Moroccan royals maintained Web sites or blogs.","5943":"The Korengal Valley is a lonely outpost of regress: most of the valley\u2019s people practice Wahhabism, a more rigid variety of Islam than that followed by most Afghans, and about half of the fighters confronting the U.S. there are homegrown. The rest are Arabs, Pakistanis, Chechens, Uzbeks; the area is close to Pakistan\u2019s frontier regions where Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other Al Qaeda figures are often said to be hiding out. The Korengal fighters are fierce, know the terrain and watch the Americans\u2019 every move. On their hand-held radios, the old jihadis call the Americans \u201cmonkeys,\u201d \u201cinfidels,\u201d \u2018\u2019bastards\u201d and \u201cthe kids.\u201d It\u2019s psychological warfare; they know the Americans monitor their radio chatter.","5945":"Mr. Obama adds that on Pakistan, he had said that if we have actionable intelligence about Osama bin Laden, and Pakistan can\u2019t strike against him, we should.","5946":"Conversations with a score of voters indicated that Mrs. Clinton seemed to benefit from the enduring popularity of her husband, whose presidency is largely associated with better times here, even if he pushed through Nafta, the trade agreement whose mere mention provokes as much ire as the name Osama bin Laden.","5947":"\u201cI\u2019ve been paying attention, John McCain,\u201d Mr. Obama said, speaking to a crowd of 7,000 in the St. John Arena on the Ohio State campus. \u201cSo John McCain may like to say he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of Hell, but so far, all he\u2019s done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq.\u201d","5948":"\u201cI\u2019ve been paying attention John McCain,\u201d Mr. Obama said, speaking to a crowd of 7,000 people in the St. John Arena on the campus of Ohio State University. \u201cSo John McCain may like to say he likes to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, but so far all he\u2019s done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq.\u201d","5949":"An insurgent group operating in Iraq, called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, is actually a homegrown Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign led. The extent of its links to Osama bin Laden\u2019s network is not clear. Some leaders of the group have sworn allegiance to Mr. bin Laden, but the precise links and extent of affiliation are unknown, and it was created after the American invasion.","595":"Beyond news organizations in the United States, there is the BBC in Britain, which has cultivated knowledge on terrorist movements. Al-Quds al-Arabi, a London-based Arabic newspaper, and Ha'aretz in Israel have also made such coverage routine. Rahimullah Yusufzai of The News of Pakistan, a part-time correspondent for ABC, the BBC and Time, covers Afghanistan -- whose Taliban government has sheltered Osama bin Laden -- as a local story.","5950":"Now, Colonel Davis has taken his most provocative step, completing his transformation from Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s chief prosecutor to its new chief critic. He has agreed to testify at Guant\u00e1namo on behalf of one of the detainees, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for Osama bin Laden.","5951":"As with his early opposition to the Iraq war, Mr. Obama has proved to be prescient once more. His Pakistan stance anticipated both the latest Bush administration policy \u2014 the C.I.A. killed the senior Qaeda commander Abu Laith al-Libi in just such a unilateral strike within Pakistan in late January \u2014 and Mr. McCain\u2019s own campaign posture. When Mr. McCain promises to follow Osama bin Laden to \u201cthe gates of hell,\u201d he too is vowing to go after Al Qaeda in Pakistan without restraint.","5952":"\u201cI used to love Osama bin Laden,\u201d proclaimed a 24-year-old Iraqi college student. She was referring to how she felt before the war took hold in her native Baghdad. The Sept. 11, 2001, strike at American supremacy was satisfying, and the deaths abstract.","5953":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, compile three of four excerpts from Iraqi teen blogs to present as a handout. Some suggestions include: [NOTE: The following blog entries do not reflect the views of The Learning Network or The New York Times.] \u201cSyria is a beautiful country- at least I think it is. I say \u201cI think\u201d because while I perceive it to be beautiful, I sometimes wonder if I mistake safety, security and normalcy for \u2018beauty\u2019\u0085The first weeks here were something of a cultural shock. It has taken me these last three months to work away certain habits I\u2019d acquired in Iraq after the war. It\u2019s funny how you learn to act a certain way and don\u2019t even know you\u2019re doing strange things- like avoiding people\u2019s eyes in the street or crazily murmuring prayers to yourself when stuck in traffic. It took me at least three weeks to teach myself to walk properly again- with head lifted, not constantly looking behind me.\u201d (From \u201cBaghdad Burning,\u201d October 22, 2007, found online at http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/ \u201cI was born in 29/1/1992, I grow up among well educated family.

Allow students several minutes to read and respond, and then have them share with the class. Explain that these are excerpts from the blogs of young Iraqis\u2019 in English. Does anything about the language or voices surprise students? If so, what? If not, why not? How, if at all, do they think Internet accounts and profiles such as these might impact the way the outside world views the situation in Iraq? Why? 2. As a class, read and discuss the introductory paragraphs of the article \u201cViolence Leaves Young Iraqis Doubting Clerics\u201d (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080305wednesday.html), ending right before the section labeled, \u201cYou Cost Us This,\u201d and focusing on the following questions: a. According to the article, why are many young Iraqis growing disillusioned and skeptical? b. What are some of the specific reasons given to explain this trend? c. How does Iraq compare to other parts of the Middle East when it comes to religious authority? 3. Next, divide students into small groups to finish reading and discussing the article. Each group is responsible for answering the following discussion questions on the remaining sections of the article (copied onto a handout for easier student access): \u201cYou Cost Us This\u201d a. What do you think it means to \u201cdeprogram\u201d religious extremists? b. How has Iraqis\u2019 relationship to religion changed from pre-war times up to now, according to the article? c. Who are Iraq\u2019s newest religious leaders, according to the article? d. What do you think it means that \u201cthe American liberation tasted sweetest to the Shiites\u201d? \u201cWeary of Bloodshed\u201d a. How has religious-based violence differed for Shiite and Sunni youth, according to the article? In what ways is it similar? b. What evidence does the article offer to support the toll religious-based violence has taken on the youth population? \u201cDifferent Motivations\u201d a. How do young Iraqi detainees differ from adults, according to the article? b. What role does money play in religious violence? c. Why did the 24-year-old Iraqi college student interviewed previously support Osama bin Laden, and why did she stop? \u201cWorried Parents\u201d a. What are some of the concerns Iraqi parents have regarding their teenage children, according to the article? b. What makes some of the religious insurgent recruiters so persuasive to boys? c. What thoughts do you have about the lives of young people in Iraq now that you have read this article? 4. Explain to students that now that they have read about the experiences of several different young Iraqis, both in the blog entries and in today\u2019s article, they will be writing their own one-page point-of-view pieces from the perspective of an Iraqi teen. Write the following formats on the board (or have students brainstorm some, if time allows): -blog (or MySpace or Facebook profile page) -letter to a family member -personal diary -script of a dialogue between two friends Then assign, or have students choose, one of the following profiles (written on the board, or printed on index cards): -a 14-year-old girl whose family has moved from Tikrit, Iraq to Jordan to stay with relatives until the fighting ends -a 15-year-old boy who has never been to school and sells matches on the streets of Baghdad to help his family eat -an 18-year-old female first-year college student in Baghdad who has learned that her younger brother has recently joined an insurgent group -a 16-year-old boy from Fallujah who wants to earn extra money to help his middle class family rebuild their home [NOTE: We acknowledge the complexity of Iraq\u2019s ethnic and religious populations, and have chosen not to use those categories to modify the above profiles. Depending on the depth of your students\u2019 understanding of the situation in Iraq, you may wish to encourage them to address these aspects in their point-of-view pieces.] 5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Have students spend the remainder of the period drafting their point-of-view pieces. Be sure to remind them that the focus of this assignment is to \u201cwalk in the shoes\u201d of other people their age from a different part of the world. They should keep in mind how their profile person\u2019s daily life, concerns, and general perspectives might be both different and similar to their own. Before the end of class, explain that students will be presenting their work in the following period. They should be sure to complete and thoroughly proofread their pieces at home. In the next period, have students share their pieces in groups, followed by a class discussion. Did students find it difficult to \u201cwalk in the shoes\u201d of an Iraqi teen? Why or why not? How do issues like money, religion, and culture affect kids around the world?

My argument, simply stated, was and is that Islamist militants are attacking America because of what it does in the Islamic world and not because of the way America's people think, vote, behave, and believe or not believe in God. I readily acknowledge that many of the Islamists confronting us detest our society and lifestyle and would never duplicate them in any country they would govern.

In \u201cImperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror,\u201d which he wrote anonymously while still serving as a C.I.A. officer, Scheuer anatomized Al Qaeda and the threat it posed. His earlier book, \u201cThrough Our Enemies\u2019 Eyes: Osama bin Laden, Radical Islam, and the Future of America,\u201d was more of a harangue. Nonetheless, it offered insights into bin Laden\u2019s motivations as well as the context of the Islamic world in which he operated.","5963":"She says she had 10 to 12 such sources, people with whom she also discussed subjects like the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the treatment of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.

Indeed, Pagden quotes Osama bin Laden at length for the view that the greatest crime of the United States \u2014 for which 9/11 was punishment \u2014 was that \u201cyou separate religion from your politics, contradicting the pure nature which affirms Absolute Authority to the Lord your Creator.\u201d Pagden adds that \u201cmost Muslim theologians and jurists would have to agree\u201d with bin Laden.","5976":"And Osama bin Laden has released another anti-American speech.

WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, prepare the following prompt as a handout for students to respond to in their journals: \u201cOn April 15, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI, the elected leader of the Catholic Church, arrived in Washington, D.C. to begin his first visit to the United States. The New York Times, among other major newspapers, has covered the visit in depth, offering various angles on the journey and what it means. Imagine that you are a reporter assigned to place the visit in a local context and would like readers to consider one angle about the pope\u2019s visit that you think is important. Write a lede that could begin a New York Times article that addresses the following questions that reporters must answer when delivering news: Who?: Pope Benedict XVI, Catholics in the U. S. What?: First visit to the U.S. since his election in 2005 Where?: Washington, D.C. and New York City When?: April 15 \u2013 20, 2008 As you conduct your research, you must also seek the answers to the \u201cHow\u201d and \u201cWhy\u201d questions in your lede.\u201d As needed, explain to students that a lede is another word for the opening paragraph of a story. Then prompt students to consider which elements, provided above, might be the most essential to include in the lede. How will their paragraphs offer comprehensive information and still pique readers\u2019 interest? After a few minutes, ask for volunteers to share their ledes. Then distribute or project four actual ledes written for news articles published in The Times, as seen below. Have students compare their ideas with the Times stories. What information was included in the first paragraph? What was not? Why might that be? Paragraph 1: \u201cLess than two weeks ago, as final preparations were being made for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the United States, the bishop of Camden, N.J., announced plans to close or merge nearly half the parishes in his diocese. Meanwhile, Catholics in New Orleans, Boston, New York, Toledo, Ohio, and nearly three dozen other dioceses are mourning the loss of parishes and parochial schools they grew up in.\u201d Paragraph 2: \u201cFar from tamping down emotions, Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s expression of remorse on Tuesday for the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandal prompted an angry and skeptical response from victims, who said they wanted actions, not words from the Vatican.\u201d Paragraph 3: \u201cMany years have passed since the Democratic Party was as much a part of American Catholic identity as weekly Mass and parochial school. But it still came as a shock to many Democrats to lose the Catholic vote, a key group in must-win states like Ohio, in the 2004 presidential election.\u201d Paragraph 4: \u201cPortions of the sky above, the water around, and streets all over New York will be sealed off next week when Pope Benedict XVI arrives in the city. As a religious leader and a head of state, recently accused by Osama bin Laden of leading a crusade against Muslims, the pope presents city and federal law enforcement authorities with a security challenge of considerable complexity.\u201d Finally, have students share opinions about what questions each of the ledes answers. Discuss what new questions might arise from reading the ledes and determine the section of the newspaper where each lede might be found. 2. As a class, read and discuss the article \u201cUncertain Church Awaits Pope in U.S.\u201d ( http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080417thursday.html), focusing on the following questions: a. What problems is the Catholic Church in the United States currently facing? Why? b. What steps have Catholic leaders in the United States taken to alleviate some of these problems? c. How might the pope address these problems? d. What is the sexual abuse scandal to which the article makes reference? e. In what ways has it impacted the church? f. To what extent do you think the pope\u2019s visit may relieve some of the problems faced by the church in the United States? Review the graphic \u201cThe Changing Face of American Catholics,\u201d found at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/13/us/20080412_CATHOLIC_GRAPHIC.html, focusing on the following questions: g. According to the central graphic labeled \u201c2005: 64.8 million Catholics in the United States,\u201d which state claims the largest population of Catholics and which states claims the smallest population of Catholics? h. What ethnic group appears to be responsible for the increased number of Catholics? i. In which presidential elections did Catholic voters most closely align with voters as a whole in their choice of president? Who were the presidential candidates in those years? j. In which presidential elections did they diverge most? Who were the candidates in those years? k. On which social issues does the Catholic population align and diverge most when compared with the nation as a whole? 3. Before class, prepare a chart with the following information to distribute to students: COLUMN A: NEWSPAPER SECTIONS -International -National/Politics -Science/Health -Economics/Business -Education/Schools -Dining/Travel -Arts/Entertainment/Sports -Technology/Automobiles ROW ONE: TYPES OF NEWS ITEMS -National angle -Local angle -Human interest -News analysis -Opinion piece -Interviews -Photographs -Multimedia -Graphs or charts Explain to the class that they will each assume the role of a New York Times National editor who is required to assign continuous news coverage about Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s first visit to the United States. It is their responsibility to decide what aspects of the story to cover, where to send reporters, what graphics and images will be essential, and how to use both the print and online versions of the newspaper to their best advantage. Work with the class to brainstorm the angles reporters should cover in their assignments. To begin, have them discuss as a group why the story is considered important. Why might reporters be interested in covering aspects of the story? What opportunities might they have to examine the breadth and depth of issues related to the pope\u2019s visit? Then arrange the class into eight groups and assign each group one news category on their charts. Have students work in their groups to create reporting assignments by first brainstorming various angles in reporting the story for their section. As they define their assignments, have them fill in their charts with a short description of the angle they might cover and what method of reporting they might use in doing so. As students work, remind them to consider issues such as: the role of religion in contemporary life, issues facing the Catholic Church, changes to religious belief over time, world religions and social issues influenced by belief; as well as the security issues facing world leaders who travel around the world, the role of religious leaders as celebrities or the impact of state visits on a region\u2019s economy. Direct students to the following resources to fuel their investigations: -Special section of The Times for the 2008 Papal visit to the U.S., found at http://www.nytimes.com/national/nationalspecial2/index.html -\u201cCatholic Views, Catholic Voices,\u201d found at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/13/us/20080413_CATHOLIC_VOICES_FEATURE.html -\u201cThe Changing Face of American Catholics,\u201d found at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/13/us/20080412_CATHOLIC_GRAPHIC.html -Times Topic: Pope Benedict XVI, found at http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/benedict_xvi/index.html Toward the end of class, have students share and comment on their charts. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students follow the coverage of the pope\u2019s travels in the United States and clip articles, images, commentary and other items published in The Times that relate to the news angle they investigated in class. At the end of the week, have them write a summary of the news coverage that addresses the following questions (written in their journals before the end of class): \u201cHow effective do you think the coverage is in presenting a balanced, thorough and relevant story for readers in your community and the nation, as a whole? What other issues do you think might have been interesting or important, if any?\u201d Have students consolidate the articles they collected into a special edition of The Times.","6014":"President Bush\u2019s effort to cultivate Christian fundamentalists by assuming the mantle of a \u201cChristian\u201d presidency has brought him close to Christian dominionalists who believe that their kind of Christians alone should have full political rights. They believe that non-Christians, including Mormons, such as Mitt Romney, should not be elected to public office. President Bush has continually associated his presidency, particularly the war on terrorism, with a crusade of good against evil. Gen. William Boykin, the army leader who was charged with the hunt for Osama bin Laden, claimed to Christian audiences that America is an object of hatred because we are a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d Boykin went on to repudiate Islam as a false religion, claiming that Muslims worship an idol and not the true God.","6015":"\u201cWhere in the World Is Osama bin Laden?\u201d is not so much a documentary as the movie equivalent of a nonfiction stunt book. You know the kind I mean: An author spends a year doing something just nutty and topical enough to earn a nice advance and shares the resulting insights with the public. And indeed Morgan Spurlock, the director of this film, has also written a tie-in volume that recounts, in somewhat greater detail than the movie, his half-joking search for the world\u2019s most notorious terrorist.","6016":"Searching through today\u2019s headlines about the hunt for Osama bin Laden \u2014 a topic that those two groups rarely share \u2014 The Lede found it seizing the full attention of the film critics but the partial attention of Congress and the blogosphere.","6017":"Mr. Finlayson, the trombonist, said his father, who fought in World War II and Korea, and was awarded a shelf of medals, flew the flag on the porch only on national holidays. \u201cI suppose if Osama bin Laden showed up at Kennedy Airport wearing the Stars and Stripes on his turban, he just might get through,\u201d Mr. Finlayson said.","6018":"The entity Mr. McCain was referring to \u2014 Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, also known as Al Qaeda in Iraq \u2014 did not exist until after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. The most recent National Intelligence Estimates consider it the most potent offshoot of Al Qaeda proper, the group led by Osama bin Laden that is now believed to be based on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.","6019":"These officials did not have the time or the foresight to plan for the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq or the tenacity to complete the hunt for Osama bin Laden. But they managed to squeeze in dozens of meetings in the White House Situation Room to organize and give legal cover to prisoner abuse, including brutal methods that civilized nations consider to be torture.","602":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23\u2014 United States intelligence officials said today that they were certain that Osama bin Laden was still in Afghanistan and that they did not believe that he had tried to flee the country for another haven.","6020":"Al Qaeda often uses Arab television stations to release videos of news from its leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, who are widely believed to be hiding in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. The use of the same pipeline for this video suggests a possible link between the ambassador\u2019s captors and the Qaeda network.","6021":"The heat, here, includes national catastrophes like the Great Depression, Pearl Harbor, the gas crisis of the 1970s, Osama bin Laden and Hurricane Katrina \u2014 all of which are shown in a dramatic video montage.","6022":"BLUE BELL, Pa. \u2014 The six-week Pennsylvania primary drew to a contentious finish Monday as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton invoked images of Pearl Harbor and Osama bin Laden in a television advertisement that questioned Senator Barack Obama\u2019s ability to lead in a crisis.","6023":"After a weekend of sharp exchanges, the Clinton campaign began airing a new television commercial featuring images of Osama bin Laden and the attack on Pearl Harbor, and closing with a terse question: \u201cWho do you think has what it takes?\u201d The Obama campaign circulated a flyer from Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, saying: \u201cVote your hopes, not your fears.\u201d","6024":"On the eve of this crucial primary, Mrs. Clinton became the first Democratic candidate to wave the bloody shirt of 9/11. A Clinton television ad \u2014 torn right from Karl Rove\u2019s playbook \u2014 evoked the 1929 stock market crash, Pearl Harbor, the Cuban missile crisis, the cold war and the 9/11 attacks, complete with video of Osama bin Laden. \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen,\u201d the narrator intoned.","6025":"The aide said Mrs. Clinton would continue to raise questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s readiness to face the many economic and national security challenges facing the country. He did not rule out running some version of an advertisement that the campaign ran in the final days of the Pennsylvania race showing images of the Great Depression, Pearl Harbor and Osama bin Laden and questioning Mr. Obama\u2019s fitness to lead in perilous times.","6026":"Mr. Myrick, 44, has actually been busy in Morocco shooting \u201cThe Objective,\u201d a military-horror-thriller-buddy movie set in Afghanistan that suggests that Osama bin Laden is not the only seemingly supernatural force haunting the mountains there.","6027":"I am sick of Democrats who are so namby-pamby they won\u2019t address the real challenges facing us, including Osama bin Laden. Maybe if Al Gore or John Kerry had run tougher campaigns, we wouldn\u2019t have had eight disastrous years of President Bush.","6028":"I am sick of Democrats who are so namby-pamby they won't address the real challenges facing us, including Osama bin Laden. Maybe if Al Gore or John Kerry had run tougher campaigns, we wouldn't have had eight disastrous years of President Bush.","603":"Ultimately, though, a great deal hinges on how the American retaliation unfolds. Arab allies of the United States are themselves eager to uproot terrorist networks, like the one run by Osama bin Laden, because they have long feared that such groups could topple their governments.","6031":"But how negative has the Clinton campaign been, really? Yes, it ran an ad that included Osama bin Laden in a montage of crisis images that also included the Great Depression and Hurricane Katrina. To listen to some pundits, you\u2019d think that ad was practically the same as the famous G.O.P. ad accusing Max Cleland of being weak on national security.","6033":"\u201cI\u2019d say the score is Kim Jong-il eight, and Bush zero,\u201d said Graham Allison, a Harvard professor and author of \u201cNuclear Terrorism,\u201d who was in Washington on Thursday to testify about Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cAnd if you can build a reactor in Syria without being detected for eight years, how hard can it be to sell a little plutonium to Osama bin Laden?\u201d","6035":"Next month, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who was once a driver for Osama bin Laden, could become the first detainee to be tried for war crimes in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. By now, he should be busily working on his defense.","6036":"If the architect of this destruction was Osama bin Laden, who is a qualified engineer, then he would certainly know something about the stress equations of the World Trade Center. He would also know something about the effects of ignited fuel: at 500\u00b0C (a third of the temperature actually attained), steel loses 90 percent of its strength. He must have anticipated that one or both of the towers would collapse. But no visionary cinematic genius could hope to re-create the majestic abjection of that double surrender, with the scale of the buildings conferring its own slow motion. It was well understood that an edifice so demonstrably comprised of concrete and steel would also become an unforgettable metaphor. This moment was the apotheosis of the postmodern era \u2014 the era of images and perceptions. Wind conditions were also favorable; within hours, Manhattan looked as though it had taken ten megatons.","6037":"\u201cIf character really doesn\u2019t matter, why don\u2019t they sign Osama bin Laden to play wide receiver? They need one, he\u2019s 6-foot-4, and we know nobody can catch him.\u201d","6039":"Australian television comics escaped punishment on Monday when a prosecutor dropped charges lodged against them for bringing an Osama bin Laden look-alike, above, through security at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Sydney in September, Agence France-Presse reported. The team from the show \u201cThe Chaser\u2019s War on Everything\u201d came within yards of a hotel where President Bush was staying when they posed as part of a Canadian motorcade and their three-car convoy was waved through security checkpoints. They were halted after one of the comedians from the show emerged dressed as Mr. bin Laden from a car. The 10 men and one woman working on the show were charged with entering a restricted area without justification. Nicholas Cowdery, the director of public prosecutions for New South Wales, said that the circumstances were unusual, and that the charges had been dropped. He noted that the comics, driver and crew, carrying fake security passes, had been waved into the secure zone by the police. He said, \u201cPolice permission in fact constitutes special justification for entry.\u201d","604":"Among the 27 individuals and organizations on a list attached to the order were three charities that the government believes knowingly or unwittingly channeled money to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network.

And in sharp contrast to Qaeda experts like the former C.I.A. officer Michael Scheuer (who argue that the Iraq war has served as a recruitment tool for Osama bin Laden) and a new State Department report (which notes the growth of Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe, and the growing ability of al Qaeda itself to plot attacks from Pakistan), Mr. Zakaria contends that \u201cover the last six years, support for bin Laden and his goals has fallen steadily throughout the Muslim world.\u201d","6048":"The ruling, in the case against Salim Hamdan, a detainee who was a driver for Osama bin Laden, transformed what had been something of a Pentagon soap opera over how to prosecute detainees into a formal ruling that gave new force to critics\u2019 accusations of improper political influence over this country\u2019s first use of military commissions since World War II.","6049":"NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Hassan al-Turabi, a flamboyant Islamist leader who was once friends with Osama bin Laden, was arrested on Monday morning on suspicion of fomenting a rebellion.","605":"War on terrorism must go well beyond Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. While I am prepared to be patient and to give our president as much latitude as he needs to proceed, I will consider this war a failure if one year from now Muammar el-Qaddafi still runs Libya and Saddam Hussein still runs Iraq.","6050":"Hassan al-Turabi, a flamboyant Islamist leader who was once friends with Osama bin Laden, was arrested on suspicion of fomenting a rebellion. Sudanese officials released Mr. Turabi from jail by the end of the day, but they said he might have helped a rebel force from Darfur that staged a bold attack on Khartoum, the capital, on Saturday. Mr. Turabi's Islamic political party is widely known to have links with the Darfurian rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement.

Mohammed Ali Hamadei, the suspect in a 1985 Lebanese hijacking, and Ramadan Shallah, the Syria-based head of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, are both worth up to $5 million.","6052":"The timing of the announcement was unexpected, coming days after a military judge in another case disqualified General Hartmann from participating in that case, saying the general was so closely aligned with the prosecution that it was not clear he could carry out his role with the required neutrality. That case is against a detainee who was a driver for Osama bin Laden.","6053":"Dramatizations of historical events, particularly political ones, have frequently given trouble to writers and producers trying to create compelling entertainment. In 2006 ABC made changes to \u201cThe Path to 9/11\u201d after complaints from former Clinton administration officials that it portrayed them as less than vigilant in their pursuit of Osama bin Laden. CBS dropped plans to show \u201cThe Reagans,\u201d a 2003 mini-series, after Republican and conservative groups protested its portrayal of President Reagan as forgetful and unsympathetic to AIDS victims. (The series was broadcast on Showtime.)","6054":"Glen Johnson of the Associated Press says Mr. McCain \u201csees \u2018spasmodic\u2018 but reduced violence in Iraq and Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden dead or captured and government spending curbed by his ready veto pen.\u201d","6055":"In Afghanistan, he said, an increase in actionable intelligence will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden, and \u201cthere is no longer any place in the world al Qaeda can consider a safe haven.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u201cThere still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since September 11, 2001.\u2019\u2019","6056":"The threat from a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan has been greatly reduced but not eliminated. U.S. and NATO forces remain there to help finish the job, and continue operations against the remnants of al Qaeda. The Government of Pakistan has cooperated with the U.S. in successfully adapting the counterinsurgency tactics that worked so well in Iraq and Afghanistan to its lawless tribal areas where al Qaeda fighters are based. The increase in actionable intelligence that the counterinsurgency produced led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden, and his chief lieutenants. There is no longer any place in the world al Qaeda can consider a safe haven. Increased cooperation between the United States and its allies in the concerted use of military, diplomatic, and economic power and reforms in the intelligence capabilities of the United States has disrupted terrorist networks and exposed plots around the world. There still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since September 11, 2001.","6058":"The town, about 100 miles from Peshawar, is the same place where a similar strike in 2006 was aimed at Ayman al-Zawahri, the deputy to Osama bin Laden.","6059":"In Afghanistan by 2013, Mr. McCain predicted in his speech, intelligence will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden. In addition, Mr. McCain forecast, the threat from the Taliban will have been \u201cgreatly reduced\u201d; there will be no place in the world that Al Qaeda can consider a safe haven; and \u201cthere still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001.\u201d","606":"The 27 individuals and organizations linked to Osama bin Laden and whose assets President Bush has ordered frozen are only the first cluster of a far larger group of individuals, companies and relief organizations that the United States plans to single out, an administration official said yesterday.","6060":"So, this week we\u2019ve seen John McCain\u2019s vision for the country in 2013, after he\u2019s wrapped up his first term as president. Osama bin Laden will be dead and the American economy will be prosperous, he said.","6061":"\u201cGeorge Bush and John McCain have a lot to answer for,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a midday forum here, listing the Iraq war, the strengthening of Iran and groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, Osama bin Laden\u2019s being still at large and stalled diplomacy in other parts of the Middle East among their chief failings.","6062":"Listening to the speech was like walking through the gates of Fantasyland, which Disney always said was the happiest kingdom of them all. The war in Iraq will have been won. Crack intelligence work will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden. Taxes will be lower and the U.S. economy will be swell. And maybe best of all (I\u2019m not sure for whom), work will have begun on 20 brand-new nuclear reactors.","6063":"Asked what Mr. Bush could do now to help the Republican Party, Mr. Fleischer paused and said, \u201cOsama bin Laden gets captured on his watch.\u201d","6064":"CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Osama bin Laden vowed on Friday to fight Israel for the liberation of the Palestinians, claiming their cause was at the heart of Al Qaeda\u2019s holy war with the West.","6065":"The judge, Capt. Keith J. Allred of the Navy, postponed the trial of Salim Hamdan, a former driver for Osama bin Laden, which had been scheduled to begin June 2. The trial was postponed to July 21.","6067":"Alameddine\u2019s novel also draws on ancient tradition to make an old form authentically new. At times, the stunning creative drive in \u201cThe Hakawati,\u201d with its wealth of stories and characters, can be almost overwhelming. One of its ruses teased me throughout: was the narrator\u2019s first name, Osama, an intentional reference to Osama bin Laden? After all, his last name, al-Kharrat, means \u201cthe fibster\u201d in Arabic. (This last name was bestowed on the narrator\u2019s grandfather, who performed as a hakawati in bars and cafes.)","6068":"Mr. Boll denounced the decision as politics. (The film portrays President Bush as not only in league with Osama bin Laden but also in love with him.) \u201cWe still aim for 1,000 screens,\u201d he said. (Mr. Boll\u2019s own company is distributing the film.)","607":"I wonder what Osama bin Laden did in his cave in Afghanistan yesterday?","6070":"And\u2026Osama bin Laden has issued a new video. You can get it on Nutflix, if you want to order it.","6071":"Al Jazeera English is not actually banned, but the reputation of its Arabic sibling as the preferred outlet for videos from Osama bin Laden has made the English-language version too hot to handle for some cable operators. A lack of space on crowded cable systems has also made it difficult for operators to offer Al Jazeera English.","6072":"CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Osama bin Laden released a message on Sunday denouncing Arab leaders for what he called their sacrificing of the Palestinians.","6073":"Rewards for Justice has failed to put a dent in al-Qaeda\u2019s central command. Offers of $25 million each for al-Qaeda founders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri have attracted hundreds of anonymous calls but no reliable leads, officials familiar with the program say. For a time, the program was generating so little useful information that in Pakistan, where most al-Qaeda chiefs are believed to be hiding, it was largely abandoned.","6074":"Now here\u2019s what\u2019s troubling to me. This Osama bin Laden, remember when he was wanted dead or alive? Remember that? That was like eight years ago. And now he is still recording and releasing audiotapes and videotapes. It is not right, I tell you, ladies and gentlemen. In fact, there is a new audiotape from Osama bin Laden and you can tell, you know, you can tell this one is current because in this tape he takes credit for making that guy fly in the JetBlue restroom.","6075":"Infantile, irreverent and boorish to the max, \u201cPostal\u201d explodes with bad attitude and lousy filmmaking.

That question lurks behind \u201cThe Bin Ladens,\u201d by the Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker writer Steve Coll. The world\u2019s most famous terrorist owes his fortune and his standing to a family business that Coll calls \u201cthe kingdom\u2019s Halliburton.\u201d Like Halliburton, the Saudi Binladin Group specializes in gigantic infrastructure projects.

Two days before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, her husband carried out a bombing in Afghanistan that killed the anti-Taliban resistance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud at the behest of Osama bin Laden. Her husband was killed, and she took to the Internet as the widow of a martyr.","608":"WHO WAS SINGLED OUT -- Administration officials said that the 27 individuals and organizations whose assets were frozen include the top lieutenants to Osama bin Laden and the entities most directly tied to his Al Qaeda network.

Tycoons from Dubai are pumping in a billion dollars just on their own, largely for the country\u2019s port, a gateway to the region. There is even a project on paper to build a multibillion-dollar, 18-mile bridge across the Red Sea, captained by Tarek bin Laden, the half brother of Osama bin Laden.","6081":"In March, after Danish newspapers reprinted cartoons satirizing the Prophet Muhammad, Osama bin Laden issued a threat in an audio message posted on the Internet, saying, \u201cPublishing these insulting drawings is the greatest misfortune and the most dangerous.\u201d","6082":"The caricatures were commissioned by the newspaper Jyllands-Posten and first published in 2005, setting off sometimes violent protests throughout the Muslim world. In February, after the Danish police arrested two Tunisians and a Dane of Moroccan descent on charges of plotting to kill one of the cartoonists, 17 Danish newspapers republished the cartoons as a statement of solidarity and press freedom. That ignited a new round of global protests, and prompted a threatening audio message from Osama bin Laden on March 20.","6083":"The divide over the nature of the threat turned nasty, even by the rough standards of academia, when Dr. Hoffman reviewed Dr. Sageman\u2019s book this spring for Foreign Affairs in an essay, \u201cThe Myth of Grass-Roots Terrorism: Why Osama bin Laden Still Matters.\u201d He accused Dr. Sageman of \u201ca fundamental misreading of the Al Qaeda threat,\u201d adding that his \u201chistorical ignorance is surpassed only by his cursory treatment of social-networking theory.\u201d","6084":"\u201cGaining the cooperation of an Al Qaeda member is a formidable task, but it is not impossible,\u201d Mr. Cloonan said. He said he saw Qaeda operatives who had pledged loyalty to Osama bin Laden \u201ccross the threshold and cooperate with the F.B.I. because they were treated humanely, understood what due process was about and were literally seduced by our legal system, as strange as that might sound.\u201d","6085":"Closer still, the First Lady was the first member of his inner circle to criticize the tough talk.

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, issued a statement calling Mr. McCain\u2019s remark \u201ca crystal clear indicator that he just doesn\u2019t get the grave national security consequences of staying the course. Osama bin Laden is freely plotting attacks, our efforts in Afghanistan are undermanned, and our military readiness has been dangerously diminished.\u201d","6088":"\u201cIt no longer makes sense for the government to pursue these cases through military commissions,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Brian L. Mizer, who said he would quickly press a federal court challenge on behalf of his client, Salim Hamdan, a former driver for Osama bin Laden.

From his base in northwestern Pakistan, the aging Maulavi Haqqani has maintained a decades-old association with Osama bin Laden and other Arabs. Together with his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani, 34, he and these allies now share a common mission to again drive foreign forces from Afghanistan.","6091":"As bad as all that is, the second consequence is worse by far. Oil revenues are enriching the enemies of the United States, and potentially limiting our own options in containing the threat they present. Iran alone receives more than 66 billion dollars a year from oil sales, even as that regime finances terrorists, threatens Israel, and endangers the peace of the world with its designs on nuclear weapons. Moreover, by relying upon oil from the Middle East, we not only provide wealth to the sponsors of terror -- we provide high-value targets to the terrorists themselves. Across the world are pipelines, refineries, transit routes, and terminals for the oil we rely on -- and Al Qaeda terrorists know where they are. Osama bin Laden has been quite explicit in directing terrorists to attack the oil facilities on which so much of America's economy depends. They have come close more than once. And we are one successful at tack away from an economic crisis of monumental proportions.","6092":"A London-based Muslim cleric who was known as Osama bin Laden\u2019s spiritual leader in Europe was released under severe restrictions on Tuesday, after a court decision that blocked his deportation to Jordan.","6093":"The Kuebler strategy is obvious: to irritate the powers that be into sending his client, the last citizen of a Western country at Guant\u00e1namo, home to Canada.

The fact that John McCain\u2019s top adviser says that a terrorist attack on American soil would be a \u2018big advantage\u2019 for their political campaign is a complete disgrace, and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change.

Otherwise, Bush and his administration will drive you to abyss and loss.","6113":"The release of the unnamed Algerian is the second time in a little more than two weeks that a suspect named by prosecutors as having close ties to Osama bin Laden, but not charged, has been let out on bail in Britain pending a final court ruling on government deportation proceedings.","6114":"The detainee at the center of both subplots is Salim Hamdan, a onetime driver for Osama bin Laden who was, depending on one\u2019s viewpoint, either a Qaeda loyalist with high-level ties or little more than an errand boy.","6115":"Mr. Malone\u2019s self-published his book, \u201cBin Laden\u2019s Plan: The Project for the New Al Qaeda Century,\u201d in 2005. In it, he casts himself as something of a Cassandra, direly warning of the threat posed by Al Qaeda to an unbelieving world. His writings are not so much rants as a recitation of many of the events that have marked al Qaeda\u2019s history of violence. His central thesis is relatively straightforward: that Al Qaeda represents a threat to Western civilization and that Osama bin Laden has so far been winning a \u201clong-awaited chess match\u201d with President Bush.","6116":"Mr. Malone is a 1997 graduate of the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford, where he played basketball, according to local news reports.

Democrats look like they\u2019re going to be nominating Barack Obama, Democrats for Barack Obama, and Republicans, John McCain going to be their nominee probably. And listen to this, John McCain has now vowed to capture Osama bin Laden. Well, by God, I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled. Not to be outdone, Barack Obama has vowed to get us out of the All-Star Game.","6127":"Aside from wreaking havoc on Pakistan\u2019s government and possibly sheltering Osama bin Laden, the tribal fighters holding sway over the Swat Valley in the North-West Frontier Province, the area where the new case was found, have also made it very difficult for aid organizations to carry on vaccination drives.","6128":"Hanging in the balance is an American program training Pakistani soldiers in fighting militants in the tribal areas, where Osama bin Laden was believed to be fighting.

Above a fireplace where an American flag burns is a portrait of Osama bin Laden.","613":"Israel, a state that mingles Judaism and democracy, does not thereby placate the likes of Osama bin Laden. And it is difficult to imagine Muslim radicals cozying up to an America that granted its dominant religion, Christianity, a more robust role in public life.","6130":"On Friday, while appearing on 'Morning Joe' on MSNBC, Mr. Rather, the former CBS News anchor who is now managing editor of HDNet, mistakenly referred to Mr. Obama as Osama bin Laden. Yup, the full name.","6131":"Last week, in the aftermath of The New Yorker\u2019s now notorious cover cartoon depicting Barack Obama in Muslim dress and his wife in \u201960s-style black militant gear \u2014 the two sharing an affinity for Osama bin Laden and a penchant for burning the American flag in the Oval Office \u2014 the country was abuzz with a question that is generally the preserve of doctoral candidates in English literature and cartoon-enraged Islamic militants: Are some subjects off limits to satire? Some people went further and asked if the magazine\u2019s cover qualified as satire at all. That is more to the point.","6132":"Even as Mr. Hamdan, Osama bin Laden\u2019s former driver, faced trial here, in Washington Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey called for legislation that the administration says it needs to control the scores of legal cases from terror suspects challenging their detention at Guant\u00e1namo in federal courts.

This, though, is far from settled. Osama is politically motivated: bring down the West, establish a caliphate. The Joker is a sociopath: he instills terror to instill terror (to \u201cwatch the world burn,\u201d as Alfred puts it).

He had a big sign that said \u201cOsama bin Laden.\u201d","614":"My guidance office has spent hours teaching conflict mediation instead of violence. We must focus our response to the terrorist attacks on 'diplomatic, intelligence and law enforcement aspects of American policy,' as you recommend, and tone down rhetoric that aggravates anti-American hostility and serves to draw the United States into the war between the West and the Muslim world that Osama bin Laden seems to have orchestrated so methodically.","6140":"Did you realize Osama bin Laden had a driver? Well, they caught the guy and they arrested him and he\u2019s now on trial and his name is Salim Hamdan. And he\u2019s on trial now, and here\u2019s the thing about this guy: he was a devoted employee. I mean, he loved working for Osama bin Laden, and maybe you saw him at airports. He would always show up at airports waiting for Osama bin Laden. He was the guy holding the sign that read, \u201cFanatical whack job.\u201d","6142":"And the former driver for Osama bin Laden is on trial for war crimes.

Mr. Hamdan's title may seem too trivial to be the first person tried under the 2006 law passed by Congress after the Supreme Court struck down the Bush administration's first plan for trials at the island prison. But the prosecution began to explain what driving the Qaeda leader meant, and they have given the military panel the kinds of details that carry a punch. PAGE A11","6145":"The arguments on Wednesday occurred in a hearing at which the military judge said he was considering barring the testimony of a federal agent about a 2003 interrogation at which prosecutors say Mr. Hamdan conceded that he had once sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader for whom he was a driver.","6146":"Jalaluddin Haqqani, the militia commander, battled Soviet troops during the 1980s and has had a long and complicated relationship with the C.I.A. He was among a group of fighters who received arms and millions of dollars from the C.I.A. during that period, but his allegiance with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda during the following decade led the United States to sever the relationship.","6147":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 After military prosecutors rested their case against Osama bin Laden\u2019s former driver, the military judge on Thursday closed the courtroom to the news media and other observers for the first time so the tribunal could hear defense testimony in secret.","6148":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Defense lawyers for Salim Hamdan, Osama bin Laden\u2019s former driver, rested their case on Friday after less than two days, bringing testimony to a close in the first American war crimes trial since World War II.","6149":"While 73 percent of American adults use the Internet (only 35 percent 65 or older), according to a survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, it\u2019s likely that many of them would rather have a president who can get Osama bin Laden than get online. And there is a common belief that says being president should be more a \u201cvision\u201d job than a \u201cmanagement\u201d job, and that the clutter of a digital life can only distract from the Big Picture and Deep Thoughts a leader should be concerned with. In other words, would we really want a president \u201cfriending\u201d from the Oval Office, scouring Wikipedia for information on Iran\u2019s nuclear program or fielding e-mail from someone claiming to be \u201cNigerian general\u201d seeking an American bank account for embezzled millions?","615":"Meanwhile, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell welcomed a speech by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in which he pledged to arm opponents of the de facto Taliban government in Afghanistan, which is believed to be harboring Osama bin Laden.","6150":"And yet the tribunals that just opened hardly have the feel of history in the making. They haven\u2019t merited much discussion in the presidential campaign; nor are we a nation riveted by the trial of the first defendant, a former driver for Osama bin Laden named Salim Hamdan. Instead of a landmark case, one that serves as a resonant reminder of the gulf separating us from our enemies, we have detachment and ambiguity \u2014 not just about the extent of Hamdan\u2019s guilt but also about the wisdom of the entire tribunal process as well as many other aspects of the prosecution of the war on terror.","6151":"The advantage of that haven in Pakistan, even beyond the lawless tribal realms, has allowed the Taliban leadership to exercise uninterrupted control of its insurgency through the same clique of mullahs and military commanders who ran Afghanistan as a theocracy and harbored Osama bin Laden until they were driven from power in December 2001.","6152":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Secret evidence at the war crimes trial of Salim Hamdan, Osama bin Laden\u2019s driver, showed that Mr. Hamdan offered \u201ccritical details\u201d to American forces \u201cwhen it mattered most\u201d in the early days of the war in Afghanistan, Mr. Hamdan\u2019s military lawyer said Monday in his closing argument.","6153":"\u201cThere\u2019s something so shocking about this,\u201d said Anne Pasternak, president and artistic director of Creative Time. \u201cOur hope is that it forces a consideration of an issue that people may not be thinking about \u2014 but they should be thinking about.\u201d Especially, she said, when at the arcade next door people are shooting at Osama bin Laden in post-9/11 video games.","6154":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 As the military panel at the trial of a former driver for Osama bin Laden deliberated for a full day Tuesday without reaching a verdict, the presiding military judge said he might have given the members incorrect legal instructions about how the international law of war is to be applied here.","6155":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 A panel of six military officers convicted a former driver for Osama bin Laden of one war crime Wednesday but acquitted him of another, completing the first military commission trial here and the first conducted by the United States since the end of World War II.","6156":"It was a war of retaliation and pursuit. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration demanded that the Taliban government surrender Osama bin Laden, who was commanding the Qaeda network from Afghanistan. The Taliban\u2019s refusal prompted the start of the American bombing campaign on Oct. 7.","6157":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 A panel of six military officers convicted a former driver for Osama bin Laden of one of two war crimes charges on Wednesday but acquitted him of the other, completing the first military commission trial here and the first conducted by the United States since the aftermath of World War II.","6158":"GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 Rejecting a prosecution request for a severe sentence, a panel of military officers sentenced the convicted former driver for Osama bin Laden to five and a half years in prison on Thursday. The sentence means that the first detainee convicted after a war crimes trial here could complete his punishment by the end of this year.","6159":"And as you may have heard, Osama bin Laden\u2019s driver found guilty of supporting terrorism. Osama bin Laden very upset today. He said, \u201cFrom now on, when I hire a driver, I\u2019m going to do a background check.\u201d","616":"Others have expressed their opinions, in particular, about Osama bin Laden, whom the Bush administration has described as the primary suspect in the terrorist attack. 'Ben -- You In A Heap of Trouble Boy'; 'RIP Sammy'; 'Osama Been Hiding.'","6160":"Indeed, that title is now held by another forum, run by the military, in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, where the trial of Osama bin Laden\u2019s former driver came to an end this week.","6161":"Last week was hardly the first time that we have found ourselves scratching our heads in anguished confusion about what, exactly, President Bush is trying to achieve by trashing the Constitution at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. But the sentencing of Osama bin Laden\u2019s driver, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, to five and a half years in prison is a good moment to stop and reflect.","6162":"The verdict in the first war crimes trial at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, is in: One poorly educated Yemeni, with an impish sense of humor and two little girls, is guilty of supporting terrorism by driving Osama bin Laden. With credit for time served, the sentence is no more than five months.","6163":"But we do know that it has taken almost seven years for our government to convict Salim Ahmed Hamdan, Osama bin Laden\u2019s driver, of material support of terrorism. What about those who allegedly financed the terrorists, like the Saudis? Wouldn\u2019t this be considered material support of terrorism? When will they be tried?","6164":"3. Not even close! America will cry enough from Saakashvili. It always happens to U.S.A. - nourishes scum to ruin other nations, and in the end becomes the victim and is forced to fight to the death against its own creation. So it was with Osama bin Laden, or even with Japan, whose military machine America was sponsoring at the beginning of the 20th century against Russia, and then came Pearl Harbor.","6165":"Who is to blame for Sept. 11? Most of us would point our fingers at the 19 hijackers who died that day, as well as at Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants. It was their bloody thoughts that were transformed into bloody deeds. But we can also blame those who might have prevented the catastrophe yet failed to do so \u2014 the national security adviser, who ignored warnings of imminent attack; the F.B.I., which did not heed reports of suspicious activity at a flight school in Minnesota; or the screeners at Logan International Airport who allowed box cutters past their security systems. And then there are the culprits of a more conceptual kind \u2014 American foreign policy, which perhaps saw its proverbial chickens come home to roost; or Islam, which is said to have stewed in its resentments for centuries; or globalization, which transmits grievances and conspiracies across borders as rapidly as capital and goods. If you want to blame someone for Sept. 11, you have quite a few options. Yet for seven years, we have been arguing about who is to blame, without giving much thought to the nature of blame itself.","6166":"Even during the heat of the war in Afghanistan, Mr. McCain kept an eye on Iraq. To Jay Leno in mid-September, Mr. McCain said he believed \u201csome other countries\u201d had assisted Osama bin Laden, going on to suggest Iraq, Syria and Iran as potential suspects. In October 2001, when an Op-Ed page column in The New York Times speculated that Iraq, Russia or some other country might bear responsibility for that month\u2019s anthrax mailings, Mr. McCain interrupted a question about Afghanistan from David Letterman on that night\u2019s \u201cLate Show.\u201d \u201cThe second phase is Iraq,\u201d Mr. McCain said, adding, \u201cSome of this anthrax may \u2014 and I emphasize may \u2014 have come from Iraq.\u201d (The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it came from a federal government laboratory in Maryland.) By October, United States and foreign intelligence agencies had said publicly that they doubted any cooperation between Mr. Hussein and Al Qaeda, noting Al Qaeda\u2019s opposition to such secular nationalists. American intelligence officials soon declared that Mr. Hussein had not supported international terrorism for nearly a decade.","6167":"So while Obama talked of confronting evil, McCain spoke of defeating it. Obama took the view that evil is generally abroad in the world; McCain focused on radical Islam and 9/11. Obama claimed that all of us must be metaphorical \u201csoldiers\u201d against evil; McCain paid tribute to actual American soldiers. And McCain couldn\u2019t resist saying again Saturday night that if he has to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to get him and bring him to justice, he\u2019ll do so.","6168":"Al Qaeda and other groups have said that the United Nations is a priority target. In November 2001, Osama bin Laden declared, \u201cUnder no circumstances should any Muslim or sane person resort to the United Nations. The United Nations is nothing but a tool of crime.\u201d Last year, Al Qaeda specifically denounced the humanitarian agencies of the United Nations as \u201cdirect enemies aiming to change the fabric of Muslim society.\u201d","6169":"Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf has resigned. He had assigned a task force of his military to help the U.S. find Osama bin Laden. And both of those guys were working very hard.","617":"Among the 27 individuals and organizations on a list attached to the order were three charities that the government believes knowingly or unwittingly channeled money to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network. The groups were Makhtab al-Khidamat, the Wafa Humanitarian Organization and the Al Rashid Trust. [Page B4.]","6170":"Mr. McCain: \u201cDefeat it.\u201d And pursue Osama bin Laden, he said, to \u201cthe gates of hell.\u201d","6171":"With an engaging writing style and eye to detail, Mr. Mahler, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, takes the reader through Mr. Hamdan\u2019s evolution from a street urchin to one of a handful of \u201chigh value\u201d enemy combatants. Recruited from the dirty streets around the Martyrs\u2019 Mosque, Mr. Hamdan joined a ragtag group of jihadists trying to find a path through Afghanistan to Tajikistan to fight the Russian-backed government. When their path was blocked by the fearsome warlord Ahmed Shah Massoud, they ended up starving and wandering jihadists without a cause. They eventually found food and a cause in the camp of a radical sheik recently thrown out of Sudan: Osama bin Laden.","6172":"How the candidates interpret the larger strategic meaning of Iraq uncovers an even deeper divide. Senator McCain sees Iraq as one theater \u2014 the central theater \u2014 among many in the long war. Underlying that analysis is a traditional understanding of geopolitical realities: Iraq is an inherently strong and oil-rich nation in the Arab heartland (a view shared, as it happens, by Osama bin Laden). Senator Obama sees Afghanistan and the tribal areas that have been Al Qaeda sanctuaries as the key front. While he realizes that these may be inherently poor and powerless regions in the traditional sense, he still sees the struggle as a \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d and Al Qaeda in particular. In sum, we have a choice between the broad and narrow interpretations of what the war is.","6173":"What of the Kashmiris themselves, who have repeatedly found themselves reduced to pawns in the geopolitical games and domestic politics of their neighbors? In 1989 and \u201990, when few Kashmiris had heard of Osama bin Laden, hundreds of thousands of Muslims buoyed by popular revolutions in Eastern Europe regularly petitioned the United Nations office in Srinagar, hoping to raise the world\u2019s sympathy for their cause. Indian troops responded by firing into many of these largely peaceful demonstrations, killing hundreds of people and provoking many young Kashmiris to take to arms and embrace radical Islam.","6174":"As Mr. Brand recounts in \u201cMy Booky Wook,\u201d many of his earliest professional victories were accompanied by an unhealthy dollop of vice: as an adolescent he attended (and was expelled from) a series of increasingly prestigious theater schools, where he was introduced to an array of increasingly potent controlled substances. In his 20s he became a popular host for British MTV, only to be fired from that job for showing up at the studio on Sept. 12, 2001, high on drugs and dressed as Osama bin Laden.","6175":"When John McCain said we could just muddle through in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.","6176":"On Iraq, the Democratic line has long been that the war \u201cdistracts us from the real threats we face,\u201d the real threat being \u201cthe terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11.\u201d It is as though the story of America\u2019s interests in the Islamic world began on that September morning, and that our subsequent strategy should be defined only in reference to Al Qaeda. Enumerating the scope of United States interests and involvements in the Middle East is more than this blog can bear, but ask yourself this question: if Osama bin Laden and the rest of his gang disappeared tomorrow, how much would that really change things? The region would still be a breeding ground for conflict, not only between the peoples of the region, but for the world\u2019s great powers dependent upon energy supplies.","6177":"With violence rising in Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden still at large, there are ample signs of the United States\u2019 continued battles with terrorism. But Mr. Bush and his advisers say that seven years without an attack has lulled many Americans.","6178":"At a stop on Friday in western Pennsylvania, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s biggest applause lines was reprised from his Denver speech, mocking Mr. McCain for pledging to follow Osama bin Laden to the \u201cgates of hell\u201d but not, in the view of Democrats, supporting sufficient military force in Afghanistan to capture him.","6179":"For many years, reality was out of vogue with Republicans. They ignored the reality of Iraq and Katrina, of Pakistan and Osama bin Laden.","618":"While saying that Russia was ready to open its airspace to help in search-and-rescue operations, he made no mention in his speech of whether Moscow would provide troops to back any American operation to track down the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden.","6181":"What are we to make of a fighting man who has forgotten a war? Who has forgotten, in fact, our principle war: the one against Al Qaeda, the terrorist force that attacked our country? In a 45-minute speech, John McCain did not mention Afghanistan because it is there that his choice to fight in Iraq had its most serious negative consequences. It\u2019s in Afghanistan that the cost of pulling troops to fight in Iraq meant that we still have not found Osama bin Laden, or the rest of Al Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership. It is in Afghanistan that veterans have been forced to patch metal on a pick-up truck to create some protection for themselves as they drive through mined canyons. It\u2019s there that veterans have buried fellows who died to gain ground \u2014 and given up that ground days later, for lack of troops to hold it. Despite his own, moving service in war, it is in Afghanistan that Senator McCain has broken his trust with today\u2019s armed services.","6182":"By all accounts, Pakistan\u2019s spymasters were never terribly discriminating about who showed up in their training camps. In 1998, when President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes against camps in Afghanistan following Al Qaeda\u2019s bombings of American embassies in East Africa, several trainers from Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, were killed. Osama bin Laden was supposed to be there when the missiles struck but apparently had already left.","6183":"CLINTON: I\u2019ve got a little news flash for you, Annie Oakley.

I admit you\u2019ve had a profound influence on America, and I\u2019m not just talking about all the women wearing up-dos and rimless titanium $375 Kazuo Kawasaki designer frames. You and John are now at war with four countries \u2014 Russia, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, even as Osama bin Laden has opened a storefront in a strip mall in Pakistan to make TV ads.","6184":"In the 1980s, Jalaluddin Haqqani was cultivated as a \u201cunilateral\u201d asset of the C.I.A. and received tens of thousands of dollars in cash for his work in fighting the Soviet Army in Afghanistan, according to an account in \u201cThe Bin Ladens,\u201d a recent book by Steve Coll. At that time, Mr. Haqqani helped and protected Osama bin Laden, who was building his own militia to fight the Soviet forces, Mr. Coll wrote.","6185":"CAIRO \u2014 Seven years later, it remains conventional wisdom here that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda could not have been solely responsible for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and that the United States and Israel had to have been involved in their planning, if not their execution, too.","6186":"Last week, we heard a lot of tough talk in St. Paul, but we didn\u2019t hear much about the Bush-McCain record.

It had been warned that the country\u2019s financial casinos were courting disaster.","6204":"Under insistent American demands for these tribal sanctuaries to be denied to the militants, Pakistan carried out a military offensive in August in Bajaur, the smallest and most northerly of seven so-called tribal agencies that range for about 250 miles along Afghanistan\u2019s eastern border. The tribal areas of most concern to the American military, North and South Waziristan, long suspected of harboring Osama bin Laden and other top Qaeda leaders, lie far to the south.","6205":"For the men in front of Johnson\u2019s, there was plain symmetry between the Iraq war and the financial crisis: Young people shipped out to a trillion-dollar bloodbath in the Middle East, in pursuit of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction; and banks collapsing on top of mortgages handed out to people without enough money for a bag of groceries.

In effect, these greedy geniuses built on Wall Street a doomsday machine that threatens to take us all down if they are made to bear the full cost of their financial mismanagement.","6213":"THE rising violence in Afghanistan and fractious political situation in Pakistan have become leading issues in the American presidential campaign and the debates between the candidates. Indeed, after seven years of war in the region, it\u2019s time to ask a very impolite set of questions: If we did, by chance, capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, would Afghanistan still matter? Would there be public support for sending more American troops to stabilize a country that has rarely in its history enjoyed strong central government and that abuts a tribal area in Pakistan that neither the British nor the Pakistanis have ever been able to control? Is the war in Afghanistan, deep down, anything more than a manhunt for a handful of individuals?

Perhaps the capture of Osama bin Laden or even a major terrorist attack could refocus the race on issues favoring Republicans, but barring such an unforeseen event, Mr. McCain will continue to sail against the political winds. Nothing that happened Tuesday night changed the fundamental trajectory of a race that now overwhelmingly favors Mr. Obama; indeed the policy divide between the two candidates offers compelling and unmistakable evidence as to why that is the case.","6223":"During the last debate and as he has done before, John McCain dangled a carrot before the voters by emphatically declaring that if elected, he will \u201cget\u201d Osama bin Laden.

Whether the tape\u2019s effect truly was decisive is debatable, but it is clear that Mr. bin Laden gave that election a very big jolt in the direction where Mr. Bush wanted to fight it, much the way the Wall Street crisis in September moved the 2008 election onto Democratic turf.","6228":"Last weekend, the chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia climbed on a folding chair and addressed campaign volunteers with a rallying cry linking Senator Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden. \u201cBoth have friends that bombed the Pentagon,\u201d said the chairman, Jeffrey M.

After Mumbai, it is suddenly all anyone can do just to keep Indians and Pakistanis from war.","6293":"But on April 23, 2006, Osama bin Laden seemed to signal an open alliance with groups like Lashkar, and their goals. He issued a proclamation denouncing \u201ca Crusader-Zionist-Hindu war against Muslims.\u201d He referred to the United States, Israel and India in the statement, as it was broadcast and translated by Al Jazeera. \u201cA U.N. resolution passed more than half a century ago gave Muslim Kashmir the liberty of choosing independence from India,\u201d it said. \u201cGeorge Bush, the leader of the crusaders\u2019 campaign, announced a few days ago that he will order his converted agent Musharraf to shut down the Kashmir mujahedeen camps, thus affirming that it is a Zionist-Hindu war against Muslims.\u201d","6294":"Unlike Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants, who have been forced to retreat to mountain redoubts in western Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, Lashkar commanders have been able to operate more or less in the open, behind the public face of a popular charity, with the implicit support of official Pakistani patrons, American officials said.","6295":"In an outburst, Mr. bin al-Shibh said he wanted to congratulate Osama bin Laden, adding, \u201cWe ask him to attack the American enemy with all his power.\u201d","6296":"Finally, while Mr. Bush mentioned the killing or capture of hundreds of Qaeda members around the world, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, he also noted that Al Qaeda\u2019s top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, whom Mr. Bush did not identify by name, have evaded capture.","6297":"The son of Irish immigrants to Brooklyn, Mr. Fitzgerald was raised in New York City and made his reputation there prosecuting Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who plotted to bomb local landmarks; trying four men for the East African embassy bombings; and helping to build a criminal case against Osama bin Laden.","6298":"As you reported, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the intelligence community acted properly in its surveillance of Wadih el-Hage, a naturalized United States citizen and close Osama bin Laden associate, after the 1998 terrorist bombings of American embassies in Africa.","6299":"While the names of those arrested or charged were not released, Ms. Pellens said that Malika el-Aroud, the jihadist writer, was among those charged. She had traveled to Afghanistan for training by Al Qaeda with her first husband, who was assigned by Osama bin Laden to assassinate Afghanistan\u2019s chief anti-Taliban fighter just before Sept. 11, 2001. He succeeded in killing the man, Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Northern Alliance, in a suicide bombing.","63":"LEBANON: 29 ON TRIAL -- A military court began the trial of 29 people who are accused of planning attacks on American and Israeli targets in Jordan on the orders of Osama bin Laden.

How can I know this, three years out of touch with the secret stuff? The answer is rather simple: because Osama bin Laden is still the head of Al Qaeda. And no one has been held accountable for failing to catch him.","6302":"CHICAGO \u2014 He has read \u201cGhost Wars,\u201d the history of the long adventure by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan and its fruitless effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden.

Most people I know would have circulated that message so widely that the sheer volume of cackling in response would have driven the clueless husband and his goody-two-shoes wife into the mountains of Afghanistan \u2014 where, presumably, Mrs. Gandhi would have located Osama bin Laden and brought him peaceably to justice.","6306":"Such an initiative would reinforce the all-too-accepted but false notion that \u201cIslam\u201d and \u201cthe West\u201d are distinct entities with utterly different values. Those who want to promote dialogue and peace between \u201ccivilizations\u201d or \u201ccultures\u201d concede at least one crucial point to those who, like Osama bin Laden, promote a clash of civilizations: that separate civilizations do exist. They seek to reverse the polarity, replacing hostility with sympathy, but they are still following Osama bin Laden\u2019s narrative.","6307":"But as I outline, there\u2019s a bit of hope. All the whispers in Khartoum are that the handful of key players are thinking about dumping Bashir as he becomes a drag on their own ambitions. China is inching away from Bashir. Qatar\u2019s minister of state for foreign affairs is engaging in serious, first-rate diplomacy to try to resolve Sudan\u2019s mess, the first time an Arab state has played that role. And Sudan is fearful of the Obama administration, and in the past when the regime has been afraid it has been more cooperative \u2013sending Osama bin Laden away, cooperating on terror financing and agreeing to the 2005 agreement that ended the north/south war.","6308":"In the case of the Yemeni, Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alwi, Judge Leon said it was unnecessary to rule on a government claim that he had been a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden. He ruled that there was no evidence that Mr. Alwi ever fought American forces, but said his close ties to Taliban and Qaeda forces were sufficient to establish that he was an enemy combatant.","6309":"There was no evidence that he had ever met Osama bin Laden, or had been to Afghanistan, the two senior American officials said. But in the atmosphere of fear and confusion in the months after Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Iqbal was secretly moved to Egypt for further interrogation, said one of the senior American officials.","631":"Among the blacklisted 27 are 12 individuals, including Osama bin Laden; 11 groups, including Al Qaeda; 1 corporation and 3 charities.","6310":"Our aim in Afghanistan ought to be what it originally should have been: the capture and prosecution of Osama bin Laden.","6311":"Eventually Mahmood\u2019s religious intensity, combined with his sympathy for Islamic extremism, scared his colleagues. In 1999, just as Kidwai was beginning to examine the staff of the nuclear enterprise, Mahmood was forced to take an early retirement. At a loss for what to do, Mahmood set up a nonprofit charity, Ummah Tameer-e-Nau, which was ostensibly designed to send relief to fellow Muslims in Afghanistan. In August 2001, as the Sept. 11 plotters were making their last preparations in the United States, Mahmood and one of his colleagues at the charity met with Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, over the course of several days in Afghanistan. There is little doubt that Mahmood talked to the two Qaeda leaders about nuclear weapons, or that Al Qaeda desperately wanted the bomb. George Tenet, the C.I.A. chief, wrote later that intelligence reports of the meeting were \u201cfrustratingly vague.\u201d They included an account that there was talk of how to design a simple firing mechanism, and that a senior Qaeda leader displayed a canister that may have contained some nuclear material (though almost certainly not bomb-grade).","6312":"It was the home of Ahmed al-Hada, a middle-aged Yemeni who had become friends with Osama bin Laden while fighting alongside him against the Russians in Afghanistan. Hada came from a violent family tribe based for generations in Dhamar Province, about sixty miles south of Sanaa. In a valley of squat, mud-brick houses and green terraced farms, the region was sandwiched between two volcanic peaks in the Yemen Highlands. The area had achieved some fame as a center for the breeding of thoroughbred horses. It also gained fame for kidnappings.","6313":"SANA, Yemen (Reuters) \u2014 Yemen freed Osama bin Laden\u2019s former driver last week after he served out his prison term following his return in November from the American prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, his lawyer said Sunday.","6314":"Our original goal was to go in there and take on Al Qaeda. It was to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. It was not to adopt the 51st state of the United States. It was not to try to impose a form of government, no matter how much we believe in it and support it, but that is -- that is the mission, at least, as it is being defined today.","6315":"Ten suspected Islamic militants went on trial Tuesday in an Indonesian court, accused of killing a Christian schoolteacher and plotting to bomb a cafe. The defendants, including a Singaporean who is suspected of having met Osama bin Laden, face sentences of up to life in prison if convicted on charges of illegal possession of explosives, murder, plotting a terrorist attack and harboring fugitives. The men are suspected of being members of the terrorist network Jemaah Islamiyah, their indictment said. The men were arrested in police raids last July in which authorities seized 22 explosive devices packed with bullets. The explosives were apparently intended to cause maximum damage at a bar frequented by non-Muslims, Kafe Bedudel, in a resort town on the island of Sumatra.","6316":"By failing to be smart about how we combine our hard and soft power in the struggle against jihadist terrorism, we fall into the trap set by Al Qaeda\u2019s Osama bin Laden and Hezbollah\u2019s Hassan Nasrallah, who want to cast the conflict as a clash of civilizations. But Islamists, much less all Muslims, have a diversity of views. America needs to be wary of strategies that help its enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner.","6317":"A short recap of its failings: The judge in the first military commission trial incorrectly instructed a jury on the definition of a \u201cwar crime\u201d (a concept one would have thought rather basic to a \u201cwar crime\u201d trial). The same judge gave the defendant \u2014 who had been a confidant and bodyguard of Osama bin Laden himself \u2014 a get-out-of-jail-free card. (I\u2019ve been critical of various aspects of using the criminal justice system to counter terrorism, but one thing cannot be denied: terrorists convicted in our courts have gotten appropriately severe sentences \u2014 decades or more in prison.) Finally, a general in the appointing authority (the body that oversees the commission process) suggested that statements derived from waterboarding could be used as evidence.","6318":"Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, in a taped audio message, called on Muslims everywhere to fight Israel in a holy war.","632":"No one argues that if the United States has solid evidence against Osama bin Laden, they should not hunt him down. But the recent history of American involvement in the region sways the public away from supporting Washington.","6320":"SESSIONS: Mr. Hahn, yesterday I compared the fact that the people -- that some of these people didn't actually murder somebody or set off a bomb to the fact that neither did Osama bin Laden or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. They didn't actually do it; they got people who flew the airplanes and caused all the destruction.","6321":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A son of Osama bin Laden who spent years under Iranian house arrest has left Iran and is now probably operating inside Pakistan, a senior American intelligence official said Friday.","6322":"\u201cDefeat it.

Beating back the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, and rooting out Qaeda training camps on the Pakistani border in eastern Afghanistan with the goal of finding Osama bin Laden, are all central parts of American policy, even absent a modern cohesive Afghan state.","6329":"I want the President to succeed in the war on terror. But I fear he\u2019s making the error of mirroring, of thinking that those with very different cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs share the same drives, motivations, and goals as those of the average American. The members of the Muslim world who follow Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri do not do so because they think these guys can deliver better education or health care. They follow them for a lot of reasons\u2014because they want to fight the infidel, to avenge past humiliations, because they just want to kill people\u2014but nobody signs on to al-Qaeda for the health-care plan and tuition benefits.","633":"For instance, experts said, what can be done online to track a group of criminals depends in part on what those criminals have done online. The organization led by Osama bin Laden, whom President Bush has called the prime suspect in the attacks, is known not to trust high technology for important messages, relying on face-to-face communication instead.","6330":"Consider, for example, the case of the \u201c20th hijacker,\u201d Mohammed al-Qahtani. Recently, Judge Susan J. Crawford, the senior official for the Pentagon\u2019s military commissions, ruled that he had been tortured and therefore could not be prosecuted.

These discussions produced a double-barreled national-security strategy that dominated President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure. The first element of the strategy was to identify and eliminate terrorist networks that already existed. The second was to prevent new networks from flourishing by promoting open, democratic societies that, the thinking went, would be less susceptible to Al Qaeda\u2019s message than closed ones.

'Bunnies, dogs,' she murmured. 'This guy is relentless.'","6350":"But you might reply that it depends on how one defines the word good. In a world of easily identified devils \u2014 Osama bin Laden, Kim Jong-Il, Bernard Madoff \u2014 most of us feel we\u2019re basically on the side of the angels. We work hard, pay our bills, try to raise our children well, volunteer a bit here and there and, when in doubt, abide by the golden rule. (Don\u2019t we?) Why not give ourselves the benefit of the doubt?","6352":"Celebrity birthday today. Osama bin Laden turned 52 today, and apparently he\u2019s going through a mid-life crisis because he bought himself a bright red 1965 camel.","6353":"Monologue | Aired Wednesday night on CBS: Hey, you know Osama bin Laden? Well, he celebrated his 52nd birthday recently. Unfortunately, people think he\u2019s starting to lose it. For example, earlier today, he walked into a cave and said, \u201cWhat did I come in here for?\u201d","6354":"They may have to put him in a cell that separates him from the general population because this guy is really hated. He\u2019s like Osama bin Laden, O.J. Simpson and Rush Limbaugh rolled into one person.","6355":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (Reuters) \u2014 Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda\u2019s leader, accused moderate Arab leaders of plotting with the West against Muslims and urged his followers to prepare for jihad, in a recording broadcast Saturday by Al Jazeera television.","6356":"Osama bin Laden turned 52 years old yesterday. You can tell Osama was getting older. Like today, he declared a jihad on erectile dysfunction.","6357":"Monologue | Aired Monday night on CBS: Here\u2019s a guy that won\u2019t go away, that Osama bin Laden. We got another audiotape from bin Laden. Have you heard it? He attacks moderate Arab leaders, he calls for renewed jihad, and he gives his N.C.A.A. picks.","6359":"A descendant of India\u2019s leading political dynasty said Wednesday that he was a victim of a political conspiracy in connection with inflammatory comments against Muslims. Varun Gandhi, left, a great-grandson of India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, is a candidate of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in this spring\u2019s general election. The local news media have shown videotape in which he appears to say he would cut off the hands of Muslims who threatened Hindus, and compared a rival Muslim candidate to Osama bin Laden. The country\u2019s Election Commission ordered Tuesday that he face criminal charges; Mr. Gandhi said the tape had been doctored. \u201cThat is not my voice. Those are not my words,\u201d he said on Times Now, a news channel in New Delhi. Mr. Gandhi is also the nephew of the head of India\u2019s governing Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi, from whom he is estranged.","6361":"I heard this today, a new audiotape from Osama bin Laden was released. On the tape, he says he doesn\u2019t care what anyone says, he\u2019s not giving back his bonus money.","6362":"The arrest concerned accusations of financial fraud and other charges, but government lawyers would later argue that Mr. Marri was a \u201csleeper agent\u201d for Al Qaeda who had met with Osama bin Laden and had pledged to come to the United States as part of a broader attack plan to follow Sept. 11. He arrived in this country on Sept. 10, 2001.","6364":"In their written statement, decorated with crossed swords, the three Pakistani Taliban leaders reaffirmed their allegiance to Mullah Omar, as well as the leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.","6365":"The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, Pakistan. In the nearly eight years since 9/11, al Qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier. This almost certainly includes al Qaeda's leadership: Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe-haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with followers, plot attacks, and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan. For the American people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.","6366":"The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, Pakistan.

They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe-haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with followers, plot attacks, and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan.

As I was saying yesterday you have to at things through some very American-tinted lenses to see a \u201cregional\u201d consisting of Pakistan and Afghanistan somewhere on the map. Pakistan\u2019s \u201cregional\u201d outlook is all about India, and Russia and China see Afghanistan as existing in a \u201cregion\u201d of Central Asian states that border them. America\u2019s interests in Afghanistan are narrow and a little bit idiosyncratic\u2014relating to the contingent fact that Osama bin Laden took his operation there about a decade ago\u2014but there are also enduring facts of geography and culture that shape other countries\u2019 responses.","6368":"President Obama said yesterday that he believes that Osama bin Laden is plotting new attacks against the United States. Obama came up with this theory when he picked up any newspaper from the last eight years.","6369":"In arguing that \u201creligion\u2019s power\u201d has \u201ccontinued to increase,\u201d they contradict considerable evidence to the contrary. (The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, released this month, found that \u201cthe U.S. population continues to show signs of becoming less religious, with one out of every five Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008.\u201d) In arguing that modernity and religion are compatible, Mr. Wooldridge and Mr. Micklethwait play down that Osama bin Laden and other radical jihadis embrace highly puritanical, backward-looking forms of Islam that stand in direct opposition to much of modernity. (The authors also fail to grapple with the anti-progressive impulses of Christian and Jewish fundamentalism.) And in arguing that religion is increasingly a matter of choice, they ignore the plight of people (like women under Taliban rule) who are forced to live by strict religious codes they themselves may not believe in.","637":"The administration, which has been critical of 'nation building' missions for the United States military, appeared to be trying to walk a fine line between increasing pressure on the Taliban, who have given refuge to Osama bin Laden, the accused terrorist, and finding itself enmeshed in an eventual attempt to rebuild the ruined state of Afghanistan under a new government.","6370":"The government had backed away from the anthrax accusations but had continued to hold the detainee, Dr. Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi, asserting that he had worked for a charity that had terrorist ties and that he had met with Osama bin Laden.","6371":"Under Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, the United States is scheduled next year to take over from the Europeans the command in southern Afghanistan, which has seen the worst resurgence of violence. The United States will retain the command in fiercely contested eastern Afghanistan, across from Pakistan\u2019s lawless tribal areas, where Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, has said that Osama bin Laden and important Qaeda leaders reside.","6372":"In October during the campaign for the presidency, Mr. Frederick made headlines when he said that then Senator Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden \u201cboth had friends that bombed the Pentagon,\u201d a reference to Mr. Obama\u2019s acquaintance with William Ayers, a member of the Weather Underground radical group in the 1960s. The comment drew a rebuke from Mr. Obama\u2019s Republican opponent, Senator John McCain.","6373":"Theologically, Sheik Adil reflects the general evolution of Saudi thinking over the last two decades. During the 1980s he met Osama bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam, a leader of the jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan. He initially sympathized with their radical position and anger toward the West. Later, he said, he began to find their views narrow, especially after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.","6374":"And in a letter to Ms. Napolitano, David Rehbein, the commander of the American Legion, wrote, \u201cTo continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical disgruntled military veteran is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam.\u201d Ms. Napolitano indicated that she would meet with Mr. Rehbein upon her return to Washington.","6375":"The memo summarizes the C.I.A.\u2019s judgment that Abu Zubaydah, then 31, had risen rapidly to \u201cthird or fourth man in Al Qaeda\u201d and had served as \u201csenior lieutenant\u201d to Osama bin Laden. It said he had \u201cmanaged a network of training camps\u201d and had been \u201cinvolved in every major terrorist operation carried out by Al Qaeda.\u201d","6376":"\u201cThe harm is that if we ever return to those policies, one is they can train against them now,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cDo we really think that having advanced interrogation techniques is something we don\u2019t want to use if we find Osama bin Laden?\u201d","638":"Why has it taken thousands of lives and the horrific devastation of our country's financial and defense centers for the United States government finally to decide on sweeping measures to freeze the assets of Osama bin Laden and other known terrorists?","6380":"The federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan is a towering presence, more than big enough to have handled such history-in-the-making cases involving a Gotti, a Madoff, and several men who have pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden.","6381":"The F.B.I. was careful to stress that it considers Mr. San Diego, and other extreme animal rights activists, worthy of being placed on a list headed by violent extremists like the leaders of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and Ayman Al Zawahiri:","6382":"His father, Ahmed Said Khadr, who was killed by government forces in Pakistan, was thought by Canadian intelligence officials to be an associate of Osama bin Laden. Nathan Whitling, a lawyer representing Omar Khadr, said he thought that the Canadian government\u2019s reluctance to seek his client\u2019s repatriation was a political calculation based on public antipathy in Canada toward Mr. Khadr\u2019s family.","6383":"Neither man gave up Osama bin Laden. Every good interrogator knows that a detainee can give up information that sells out the men and operations below him. They need only protect their leader for the organization to survive. The fact that Osama bin Laden is still alive is proof that waterboarding does not work.","6384":"At times his account is thoughtful and nuanced, as in his discussion of the role of torture in the French campaign in Algeria, but on other occasions he generalizes with breathtaking self-confidence. Speaking about a fifth of the world\u2019s population, he asserts that \u201cMuslims liked to point out\u201d and \u201cMuslim girls toe the line at home\u201d and \u201cmost Muslims do not seem to grasp the fact that.\u201d Sometimes he is quite funny, as when he compares Osama bin Laden to \u201csuperannuated rock stars\u201d like Bono and Bob Geldof, though it is not always clear that he means to be.","6385":"Second, Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda aspired to deliver a devastating blow to America. They \u201cwere involved in an extraordinarily sophisticated and professional effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction. In this case, nuclear material,\u201d Michael Scheuer, the former C.I.A. bin Laden expert, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2004. \u201cBy the end of 1996, it was clear that this was an organization unlike any other one we had ever seen.\u201d","6386":"They say this swine flu is pretty rough, if you happen to get it. In fact, on the news today, I heard a commentator say, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t wish this on your worst enemy.\u201d People always say that about something that\u2019s really bad. But are you all hoping that Osama bin Laden or Bernard Madoff doesn\u2019t get this?","6387":"It is not new for Islamic extremists to cite Western counterterrorism reports. Ayman Zawahri, the deputy of Osama bin Laden, has referred at least twice in his taped statements to \u201cStealing Al Qaeda\u2019s Playbook,\u201d a 2004 article also published by the center. But recently Mr. Maqdisi has taken this hall-of-mirrors phenomenon to a new level, complaining bitterly that secular Western analysts generally understand him better than many in his own community.","6388":"Americans who are experts on the Pakistani system worry about what they do not know. \u201cFor years I was concerned about the weapons materials in Pakistan, the materials in the laboratories,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, who ran the Energy Department\u2019s intelligence unit until January, and before that was a senior C.I.A. officer sent to Pakistan to determine whether nuclear technology had been passed to Osama bin Laden.","6389":"The second case involved the Umma-Tameer-E-Nau, which was founded by Pakistani nuclear scientists with close ties to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It was headed by Bashiruddin Mahmood, a retired senior Pakistan Atomic Energy Agency official who had headed Pakistan\u2019s Khushab Atomic Reactor. He discussed Al Qaeda\u2019s nuclear aspirations with Osama bin Laden.","639":"That makes them perfectly suited to the war the United States is now preparing to wage. If men like Osama bin Laden are hiding in remote caves or underground bunkers, military experts say, no one is more likely to overpower them than the commandos of Delta Force.","6390":"The White House reiterated Friday its focus on thwarting terrorism in the two countries, but said it would not focus solely on Osama bin Laden.","6391":"This unworkable, dual sovereignty of the divinely appointed and the popularly elected lies at the heart of Iran\u2019s problems and is the cause of its debilitating factional strife. Coughlin has little feel for the role Iran\u2019s warring factions play in its foreign policy, and often relates only half the story. He paints a picture of Iran as a state in cahoots with Al Qaeda, writing that Tehran masterminded the escape of operatives fleeing from Afghanistan, including Osama bin Laden\u2019s son Saad, and provided them safe haven. He states that \u201cthe presence of such prominent Al Qaeda militants in Iran . . . was yet another issue that would undermine Khatami\u2019s attempts to improve relations with the West.\u201d","6392":"Obama has, moreover, made climate change a national-security issue. Just days after taking office, he described the long-term threat of climate change as one that \u201cif left unchecked, could result in violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines and irreversible catastrophe.\u201d This was highly contentious in the past. When the intelligence community went to Capitol Hill last year to request resources to look closer at climate change, one Republican lawmaker exclaimed incredulously, \u201cWe are going to take analysts away from looking for Osama bin Laden, and we are going to put them on the \u2018March of the Penguins\u2019!\u201d","6394":"The Qaeda operatives are foreigners inside Pakistan, and experts say that the group\u2019s leaders, like Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, appear to be wary of claiming credit for the violence in the country, possibly creating popular backlash against the group.","6395":"Somewhat disturbingly, the source for the \u201ctop story\u201d on Pakistan Daily today is Pakistan\u2019s president, Asif Ali Zardari. As an anonymous article on the site reports accurately, in an interview with NBC News which aired on Sunday, Mr. Zardari claimed that he \u201cknew\u201d that Osama bin Laden was an American \u201coperator\u201d during the 1980s.","6396":"President Obama\u2019s national security advisor says he just doesn\u2019t know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. Same thing with Larry King \u2014 we don\u2019t know.","6397":"Mr. Ghailani also said that he had once met Osama bin Laden, as well as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the Qaeda figure held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay who has said that he was the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.","6398":"Having Osama bin Laden in one\u2019s sights is one thing. Devoting precious resources to his capture or death, rather than focusing on protecting the Afghan and Pakistani populations, is another. The goal should be to isolate extremists from the communities in which they live. The best way to do this is to adopt policies that build local partnerships. Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies must be defeated by indigenous forces \u2014 not from the United States, and not even from Punjab, but from the parts of Pakistan in which they now hide. Drone strikes make this harder, not easier.","6399":"Nor did the deal Mr. Abedi described mention either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahri, the two senior Qaeda leaders believed to be hiding in Pakistan under the protection of the Taliban or some other armed group.","64":"Both intentions present problems for the United States, which keeps Sudan on its list of nations supporting international terrorism because, the Clinton administration says, the Sudanese government maintains links with Osama bin Laden, a financier of Islamic militancy.","640":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 25\u2014 Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, met senior Iranian leaders today in Tehran on what he termed a historic visit, part of a flurry of diplomacy aimed at gaining cooperation from Iran as the United States musters a coalition against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan.","6400":"Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people. And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face. We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country. But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States. Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans. These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.","6401":"These, he said, are prisoners who in effect remain at war with the United States, even after some seven years at Guant\u00e1namo. He listed as examples detainees who received extensive explosives training from Al Qaeda, have sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden or have otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans.","6402":"American officials said the United States would still take custody of the most senior Qaeda operatives captured in the future. As a model, they cited the case of Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, an Iraqi Kurd who is said to have joined Al Qaeda in the late 1990s and risen to become a top aide to Osama bin Laden, and who was captured by a foreign security service in 2006. He was handed over to the C.I.A., which transferred him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in April 2007. He was one of the last detainees shipped there.","6403":"Larry King said the one person he would most like to interview is Osama bin Laden. Not because bin Laden\u2019s so fascinating, just because they both lived in caves.","6404":"Stress laughed at that remark, when it was later recounted. \u201cBlocher\u2019s Switzerland is people in the mountains making cheese,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you also have a Switzerland where people struggle to make ends meet. His party doesn\u2019t represent the Switzerland where I grew up, which is made up of people who came to build the country, literally to build its buildings and streets. The Swiss People\u2019s Party campaigns by using Osama bin Laden in posters about the threat of immigration. For me this is just unfair.\u201d","6405":"The lawsuit, brought by a number of insurance companies for the victims and their families, accuses members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia of providing financial backing to Al Qaeda \u2014 either directly to Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders, or indirectly through donations to charitable organizations that they knew were in turn diverting money to Al Qaeda.","6406":"At the McClatchy newspapers\u2019 Washington bureau, the reporters Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel detailed 10 whoppers. With selective quotations, Cheney falsified the views of the director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, on the supposed intelligence value of waterboarding. Equally bogus was Cheney\u2019s boast that his administration had \u201cmoved decisively against the terrorists in their hideouts and their sanctuaries, and committed to using every asset to take down their networks.\u201d In truth, the Bush administration had lost Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, not least because it started diverting huge assets to Iraq before accomplishing the mission of vanquishing Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. That decision makes us less safe to this very minute.","6408":"Much that is known of Mr. Hanashi was provided by military officials at his hearings at Guant\u00e1namo. They said he had ties to Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, an Iraqi Kurd now at Guant\u00e1namo who intelligence officials say was a top aide to Osama bin Laden.","6409":"Updated | 9:59 a.m. If President Barack Obama\u2019s trip this week to the home countries of both of Al Qaeda\u2019s top leaders achieves nothing else, it appears to have already succeeded in annoying Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.","6410":"CAIRO \u2014 Just as President Obama arrived in the Middle East, the television channel Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape on Wednesday that it said was from Osama bin Laden, accusing Mr. Obama of planting new seeds of \u201chatred and vengeance toward Americans.\u201d","6411":"In a new audiotape, Osama bin Laden condemned Mr. Obama for planting what he called new seeds of \u201chatred and vengeance\u201d among Muslims, while in Jerusalem, senior Israeli officials complained that Mr. Obama was rewriting old understandings by taking a harder line against existing Israeli settlements.","6412":"Talk about a guy who won\u2019t go away. How about Osama bin Laden? I mean, come on. Come on with this guy. And there\u2019s another one of those aggravating tapes that he sends out from time to time and they put them on the Al Jazeera network. There\u2019s a new tape and people say, \u201cWell, how do we know this is a current tape?\u201d Well I\u2019ll tell you how you can tell that this is a current tape. At the end of the tape, he wishes Jay luck on the new 10 p.m. show.","6413":"Mr. Obama structured his speech almost like a Friday Prayer, blending a political, social and religious message. In style and substance, some regional analysts said, it sought to undermine the message of radical terrorists like Osama bin Laden.","6414":"On Wednesday, in an audiotape, Osama bin Laden specifically cited the fighting in Swat and Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, blaming the Obama administration for the campaign and for sowing \u201cnew seeds to increase hatred and revenge on America.\u201d","6415":"By the way, I think this is good news. The C.I.A. announced that they have a new lead on Osama bin Laden. They think that he\u2019s been hiding out in the $2,500 dollar seats at Yankee Stadium. They think that\u2019s where he is.","6416":"Just the day before, in fact, a pre-emptive audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden warned his followers not to trust whatever Mr. Obama would say. And as it turned out, his fear was justified. In the view of Fawaz Gerges, the president\u2019s speech was above all else about the war on terror, a direct attack on Mr. bin Laden and the mindset he promulgates.","6417":"The military charged that he received weapons and explosives training at a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in late 1998, and that he later served as a bodyguard and cook to Osama bin Laden.","6418":"The shift of fighters is still small, perhaps a few dozen, and there is no evidence that the top leaders \u2014 Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri \u2014 are considering a move from their refuge in the Pakistani tribal areas, according to more than half a dozen senior administration, military and counterterrorism officials interviewed in recent days.","6419":"Many of the 88 members are retired civil servants and tradesmen who fix up used motorboats and spend weekends chasing bluefish and drinking Budweiser. The bar is open to the public, but is usually filled with raucous members comparing pensions and overtime pay and making fall hunting dates. The bathroom is distinguished by a urinal bearing a decal of Osama bin Laden \u2014 for target practice. A retired police officer is the bartender, and retired firefighters work in the kitchen.","642":"HAMBURG, Germany, Sept. 25\u2014 German police are investigating financial ties between two hijackers who rammed airplanes into the World Trade Center towers and a Syrian businessman here who controls a Hamburg bank account belonging to a founder of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.","6420":"That honeymoon, if it was one, is over. Conservatives have legitimate ideological beefs with Obama, rightly expressed in sharp language. But the invective in some quarters has unmistakably amped up. The writer Camille Paglia, a political independent and confessed talk-radio fan, detected a shift toward paranoia in the air waves by mid-May. When \u201cthe tone darkens toward a rhetoric of purgation and annihilation,\u201d she observed in Salon, \u201cthere is reason for alarm.\u201d She cited a \u201cjoke\u201d repeated by a Rush Limbaugh fill-in host, a talk-radio jock from Dallas of all places, about how \u201cany U.S. soldier\u201d who found himself with only two bullets in an elevator with Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Osama bin Laden would use both shots to assassinate Pelosi and then strangle Reid and bin Laden.","6421":"Mr. Ghailani has pleaded not guilty. Military authorities have also said that he was later a bodyguard and cook to Osama bin Laden.","6422":"BERLIN \u2014 A prominent Saudi cleric who has extolled Osama bin Laden and preached violence against Shiites, Jews and Christians slipped quietly into Germany for medical treatment in April and even received police protection in the hospital before his departure last month, government and medical officials acknowledged Wednesday.","6423":"9 P.M. (National Geographic) C.I.A. CONFIDENTIAL This series about the C.I.A.'s mission after 9/11 looks at how agents infiltrated Afghanistan with the assignment of decimating Al Qaeda and hunting down Osama bin Laden. At 10, the series examines the organization's new battlefield in the war on terror: Pakistan.","6424":"He and other defense lawyers said that rather than supporting Al Qaeda, the Saudis were sworn enemies of its leader, Osama bin Laden, who was exiled from Saudi Arabia, his native country, in 1996. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute tragedy what happened to them, and I understand their anger,\u201d Mr. Kellogg said of the victims\u2019 families. \u201cThey want to find those responsible, but I think they\u2019ve been disserved by their lawyers by bringing claims without any merit against the wrong people.\u201d","6427":"Mr. Ghailani, a Tanzanian who is believed to be in his mid-30s, became a fugitive after the attacks, and later worked as a bodyguard and cook for Osama bin Laden, military authorities have said.","6428":"In the interviews, Mr. Hussein described Osama bin Laden as a \u201czealot\u201d and denied that Iraq had any substantive ties to Al Qaeda. Both that claim, and the assertion that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, were later confirmed by American intelligence agencies.","6429":"He became a fugitive after the attacks, and later was a bodyguard and cook for Osama bin Laden, the military has said. He has pleaded not guilty.","643":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following questions in their journals (written on the board prior to class): \u201cWhere do you get your news? Do you think your sources are reliable? Why or why not?\u201d Students then share their responses. What different types of news sources can students name? How are these sources similar and different? 2. As a class, read and discuss \u201cSaudi Arabia Cuts Ties with Taliban,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. What did Saudi Arabia announce on September 25, 2001? b.

It is strongly suggested that you engage students in a discussion of the historical and political contexts of the Taliban regime and its relationship with the United States and other countries before starting the main activity (see Background section above). You may wish to create a timeline on the board starting with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and ending with the current crisis. Divide students into small groups, and give each group three articles, each from a news source from a different country, all published on the same day and focusing on the Taliban. Sources may include, but are not limited to, American, continental European, Middle Eastern (Arab and Israeli), and Latin American sources. Groups should read the articles (either aloud as a group or individually, rotating the articles among them until all articles are read), and then respond to the following questions (one student in the group should act as the \u201csecretary\u201d; questions written on the board for easier student access): \u201cConsider all of the articles read in class today to answer these questions: \u2013Look at the headlines of the articles. What can you tell about the articles from their headlines? \u2013Which articles contain photographs? What do they depict? What emotions do you think they are supposed to evoke? \u2013How are the articles similar in their accounts of the subject or event? \u2013How are the articles different? \u2013What information do some articles provide that others do not? Why do you think that is? \u2013What information do some articles omit that others include? Why do you that is?\u201d Allow students the opportunity to discuss their findings, either at the end of class or in a future class. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Ask students to watch at least one international news report on television this evening, jotting down notes about how these news reports explore the issues discussed in the articles read in class. Then, each student writes a brief (one to two page) thoughtful evaluation of the information presented, comparing and contrasting print and television news reports of the same topic. Students should be sure to watch with same critical perspective from which they read their print news reports.","6430":"BEHIND THE NEWS The interviews point up Mr. Hussein's striking miscalculation of the risks he faced and the United States' mistaken estimate of the threat Iraq really posed. In the interviews, Mr. Hussein also described Osama bin Laden as a 'zealot' and denied that Iraq had any substantive ties to Al Qaeda. Both that claim, and the assertion that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, were later confirmed by American intelligence agencies.","6431":"Monologue | Aired Tuesday night on CBS: Here\u2019s something wacky.

And she says that she suspected the marriage was in trouble when he told her he was going for a hike on the Appalachian Trail.","6433":"Two friends showed The Times the Facebook communications of four of the men, including one whose profile picture was, until recently, of Osama bin Laden.","6434":"The program was designed in the frantic weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks when President George W. Bush signed a secret order authorizing the C.I.A. to capture or kill operatives of Al Qaeda around the world. To be able to kill Osama bin Laden or his top deputies wherever they might be \u2014 even in cities or countries far from a war zone \u2014 struck top agency officials as an urgent goal, according to people involved in the discussions.","6435":"Overall, the United States spent more than $430 billion for military and diplomatic efforts over the first five years and deployed military forces to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. This amount was larger than the annual gross domestic product of 89 percent of the world's countries. Afghanistan was where much of the planning and training for the September 11 attacks took place and, at least initially, it was the central front of America's \"war on terror.\" And rightly so. Following his capture, Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, head of al Qa'ida's military committee and Osama bin Laden's principal operative for the attacks, boasted: \"I was Emir [commander] of Beit al Shuhada [the Martyrs' House] in the state of Kandahar, Afghanistan, which housed the 9/11 hijackers. There I was responsible for their training and readiness for the execution of the 9/11 operation.\"","6436":"There is a new Osama bin Laden tape.

Before you make your judgment, before you decide, if it weren\u2019t for Dick Cheney and his secret assassination squad, Osama bin Laden would be alive today.","6438":"Few operations are riskier than a targeted killing, but the idea of eliminating a very bad guy has an alluring simplicity. Had the Clinton administration found a way to kill Osama bin Laden, might that have scuttled the 9/11 plot? Had a Bush administration hit team taken out Saddam Hussein, might Mr. Bush not have led the country into a messy, costly war?","6439":"He became a fugitive after the attacks, and later served as a bodyguard and cook for Osama bin Laden, military authorities have said. He has pleaded not guilty, and could face the death penalty if the government decides to seek it.","644":"SEATTLE, Sept. 26\u2014 Nearly forgotten until Sept. 11, an Algerian-born operative for Osama bin Laden's network was sitting in a federal detention center just south of here, awaiting sentencing for his role in a plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport during the 2000 millennial celebrations.","6440":"Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is also a Saudi national although the authorities stripped him of his passport in the 1990s.","6441":"Ms. El Aroud, a Belgian citizen, has become one of the most prominent Internet jihadists in Europe.

They believe now, intelligence believes, that a U.S. missile attack about six months ago killed one of Osama bin Laden\u2019s sons. And the C.I.A. believes that it was the hot-tempered Sonny.","6445":"\u201cAcross from Dabic\u2019s apartment in New Belgrade, there lived a woman who worked at Interpol,\u201d Vekaric of the I.C.T.Y. told me. \u201cEvery morning this woman switched on her computer and there was a picture of Radovan Karadzic and Osama bin Laden. And each morning she would say good morning to Dragan Dabic.\u201d She never suspected who her neighbor was.","6446":"The same day that President Obama spoke to the Muslim world from Cairo University, Osama bin Laden released a long statement on Islamic Web sites and on Al Jazeera. As the Egyptian Middle East expert Mamoun Fandy noted: \u201cObama beat Osama hands down. Ask anyone about the content of Obama\u2019s speech and they will tell you. Ask them what Osama said and most people will say, \u2018Did he give a speech?\u2019\u00a0\u201d","6447":"Khomeini's fatwa reflected the recognition that jihad's proper targets don't just include Western vessels and buildings. They also, and more fundamentally, include Western freedoms \u2014 above all, the foundational freedom: freedom of speech. What has emerged from this recognition is a new phase of jihad whose advantages include not requiring jihadists to engage in combat to the death but only in such low-risk activities as the writing of letters of complaint to government officials, participating in \"intercultural dialogue,\" and the occasional rally, march, riot, flag-burning, or act of embassy vandalism. Not only do the participants in this modern brand of jihad take virtually no chances (there is little likelihood of arrest and even less of conviction), but they also enjoy the assistance of non-Muslims who, when not supporting these New Age jihadists out of a misguided sense of sympathy or outright fear, are motivated by ideology \u2014 namely, the pernicious doctrine of multiculturalism, which teaches free people to belittle their own liberties while bending their knees to tyrants, and which, as we shall see, has proven to be so useful to the new brand of cultural jihadists that it might have been invented by Osama bin Laden himself.","6448":"The report also shows a moment in the film in which Mr. Abu Aita\u2019s words are apparently mistranslated. When he asks, in Arabic, for a question about Osama bin Laden to be repeated, his response is rendered in English as a veiled threat against Mr. Baron Cohen.","6449":"As for the putatively existential challenge posed by Islamic radicalism, that project will prove ultimately to be a self-defeating one. What violent Islamists have on offer \u2014 a rejection of modernity that aims to restore the caliphate and unify the ummah [community] \u2014 doesn\u2019t sell. In this regard, Iran \u2014 its nuclear aspirations the subject of much hand-wringing \u2014 offers considerable cause for hope. Much like the Castro revolution that once elicited so much angst in Washington, the Islamic revolution launched in 1979 has failed resoundingly. Observers once feared that the revolution inspired and led by the Ayatollah Khomeini would sweep across the Persian Gulf. In fact, it has accomplished precious little. Within Iran itself, the Islamic republic no longer represents the hopes and aspirations of the Iranian people, as the tens of thousands of protesters who recently filled the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities made evident. Here we see foretold the fate awaiting the revolutionary cause that Osama bin Laden purports to promote.","645":"Mr. Bush has begun suggesting that the Taliban should be overthrown. But engineering the ouster of the Taliban, which have let Osama bin Laden hide out in Afghanistan for years, could engulf Afghanistan in civil war, aggravate a growing refugee crisis on Afghanistan's borders and even destabilize Pakistan. Any of these developments would embolden terrorists and undercut American interests.","6450":"As important as the violence has been the defection of some leading political figures. In April, Tareq al-Fadhli, an important ally of Mr. Saleh, joined the southern secessionist movement. Mr. Fadhli is an influential tribal figure who fought with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and helped organize former jihadists to fight against a southern secession movement on Mr. Saleh\u2019s behalf in 1994.","6451":"Next stop, Afghanistan: for America, for the insurgents, for me, in a new assignment after five years of reporting from Iraq. This is not a desert war; it\u2019s a mountain war. Mountains are hard to see around: the person with the best vantage point wins. Americans learn fast. They will do their best, but these aren\u2019t their mountains. The weather will be harder: scorching in summer, freezing in winter. You only need to have your car get stuck once in the snow in a high pass \u2014 as I did during the Id holiday on an earlier reporting trip to Afghanistan in 2002 \u2014 to realize how incredibly lonely the country can be, how easy it is to die, both from human adversaries and the elements. Max Becherer/Polaris, for The New York Times Afghanistan\u2019s Panjshir Valley Then, an Afghan driver, wearing sandals in the snow and carrying six cousins in his car, which sensibly had chains on its wheels, saved me and my translator. Our host had somehow already heard what had happened to us and laughed uproariously at our stupidity for driving without chains. But how had he known we were there? Phones did not work. As it happened, one of the men who had rescued us had told a couple of soldiers at a checkpoint; they had radioed the amusing news to colleagues down the mountain and so it went, ahead of us. \u00a0It was a reminder that news about foreigners travels quickly in Afghanistan. A stray word can save you \u2014 or be your undoing. Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAn American helicopter over Afghanistan\u2019s Korengal Valley It wasn\u2019t straightforward in Iraq, and it will surely be harder in Afghanistan. The country has many languages and ethnic groups. The Afghan Army is far more rudimentary than Iraq\u2019s, the Afghan police nearly nonexistent. The country is run, mostly, by warlords, with provinces broken into districts controlled by clans and tribes. The Americans are on their own \u2014 or lumped with those other invaders that the Afghans have gotten rid of. The central government has always been a nice idea, but it is too remote to do much. Parts of the country look like Tolkien\u2019s Mordor \u2013 nothing grows but thorns. Different country, but the same questions: Who are the Americans saving, and who are they fighting? The certain enemies are the Arab lieutenants and acolytes of Osama bin Laden, operating deep in the mountains, but the Americans do not seem to know exactly where they are hiding. The American military is all too aware that most of those killed by air strikes are Pakistani and Afghan Taliban fighters, along with whoever happens to be with them: women, children, old men. Still, the United States is there, escalating a war in a difficult place, hostile to outsiders, where Americans have already been for nearly eight years. The question again may come: Who is whose enemy?","6452":"It always starts this way, the same strident message coming over a mobile radio handset. Sometimes it interrupts steak and mash in the chow hall, lifting weights in the gym or smoking a stogie on the makeshift cigar porch at the airfield overlooking the mountains where Osama bin Laden once lurked \u2013 and perhaps still does.","6453":"What effect will the elections have on the prevention of 9/11-type strikes against the United States? What are the possibilities for eliminating Osama bin Laden, those sympathetic to him?\u2026 \u2014 JFF","6454":"But Mr. Abbasi\u2019s reaction \u2014 a response that, Ms. McHale acknowledged, apparently reflects the feelings of about 25 percent of the population, according to a recent poll \u2014 demonstrated just how tough the job is. For all of the administration\u2019s efforts to call attention to the nonmilitary ties that would bind the two countries, America is still being judged by many Pakistanis as an uncaring behemoth whose sole concern is finding Osama bin Laden, no matter the cost in civilian Pakistani lives.","6455":"After Osama bin Laden released a threatening videotape four days before the election, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld pushed Mr. Ridge to elevate the public threat posture but he refused, according to the book.

And I reacted the same way a lot of them did \u2014 by going temporarily insane. I like to think that most people who got caught up in that bellicose hysteria experienced the attacks as a spectatorial event, as unreal, and so their reaction was also unreal \u2014 like the \u201cpayback-time\u201d montage in an action film or the impotent revenge scenarios we play out in our heads. It wasn\u2019t until I actually went to New York City a week after the attacks that I understood how empty and inappropriate an emotion anger was to bring to the circumstances; it was like picking fights at a wake. New Yorkers, who had been so profoundly wounded, hadn\u2019t given in to rage; what they were, mostly, was sad. I hesitate to say this, but that was not only a ghastly time; it was also it was a beautiful time, in the same way that a friend\u2019s funeral can be beautiful. New Yorkers seemed to have had their shells torn off, the gelid stuff of their inner selves exposed and flinching at the air. Jealously tended hierarchies temporarily evaporated, and the worthless currency of human decency reacquired street value. Strangers made eye contact and got too choked up to speak. I heard about a wave of tender and desperate spontaneous sex \u2014 it would be the opposite of the truth to call it \u201ccasual.\u201d Graffiti appeared that actually spoke instead of just marking territory, like the overheard murmurs of a city talking to itself or fitfully dreaming. I saw a spray-painted message that would\u2019ve seemed trite or sentimental a week before: YOU ARE ALIVE. Sept. 11 came at the end of an idyllic but somehow flaccid decade when a half-century\u2019s threat of mass immolation seemed suspended, and the single biggest news story in the U.S. was not Kosovo or Rwanda but an act of fellatio. Suddenly seeing the same people we sit in traffic or ride mass transit with dying horribly may have made some of us take leave of our reason, but it also restored things to a truer perspective. It reminded us, briefly, that life is real. \u2014Tim Kreider Some Comfort My reactions to 9/11 included shock and sorrow, of course, but also an unfamiliar, and not entirely unpleasant sensation: belonging. My wife and I were vacationing in Yellowstone National Park. We were staying at a lodge whose appeals included a \u201cmedia free\u201d environment. The rooms had no televisions or radios, and cell phone service was spotty. For a couple of hyper-connected people like ourselves, this was pure bliss. On the last morning of our stay, I was enjoying a breakfast of blueberry pancakes when the waitress asked, nonchalantly, if we would be flying or driving later. Driving, I said. Good, she replied, because every airport in the country was closed. Something about a couple of planes hitting the World Trade Center in New York. More coffee? Within minutes, the unbelievable, unfathomable, details broke through our self-imposed information blackout. The hotel staff found a television, somewhere, and hooked it up in the lobby. A few dozen of us gathered around, as if the Sony Trinitron were a fireplace on a cold January night, the flickering light conveying not only news but, oddly, comfort as well. We experienced those horrible events together, much more so than if we were sequestered in our rooms. Nobody said much (What was there to say after all?) but that didn\u2019t matter. Suffering shared is suffering diminished, a quirk of human nature for which I remain deeply grateful. \u2014 Eric Weiner Hell, No At about 8 a.m. on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, my 6-year-old son, Jack, and his father, Max, left our home on Union Street in Brooklyn and headed for Jack\u2019s new school in Manhattan. Shortly after, I left with my daughters \u2014 Maria, Jack\u2019s twin, and 3-year-old Grace \u2014 to deliver Maria to her own first grade class in Brooklyn. It was about 8:30 when Jack and Max changed trains at the World Trade Center subway station. Just before 10:00 Grace and I returned to sign Maria out of school. At about 10:30 we paused on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Union Street to watch the black plume ascend in a rush two miles away. This image burned itself into my memory. I prayed. By 11:00 I knew my husband and son were safe. We sat in my church for a short while and saw many unfamiliar faces there. On the way home, we saw the straggling head of the procession of those who\u2019d fled the financial district on foot via the Brooklyn Bridge. Beige with ash, lost-looking and spent, they filed down Seventh Avenue under the brilliant sun. Once home, I sealed our windows, fielded calls, gave the girls lunch, and set them down on the floor by my desk to color. Each year as 9/11 approaches, my children ask about the day. Recently I mentioned a conversation I had two weeks after the event with a relative who seemed to suggest we should move out of New York. Grace, now 10, was slightly appalled. As she sees it, her parents\u2019 choice to rear a family in one of the great cities of the world is a gift. New York City has always been an experiment in hope. Somehow my children, like many of their friends who lived through and remember 9/11, see their hometown as a kind of holy city worth fighting for, a Promised Land, whose strength, courage and resilience nourishes them. Young as they are, they feel it belongs to them. They know they have inherited it, even as they grow into it, and someday, embody it. \u2014 Michele Madigan Somerville Foundations Six weeks before Sept. 11, 2001, a local was leading me around the cemetery in Aden, in southern Yemen. In sad truth, the whole town looked like a set of gravestones: few shops, no playgrounds, goats foraging in the main street, old women knocking at the windows of the occasional car. It was hard to believe that, when I\u2019d visited at the age of two, Aden was the busiest port in the world outside Manhattan, buzzing with activity until a series of wars brought it down. Harder still to put it into the same sentence as Santa Barbara, where I returned from Yemen to hear about planes, apparently overseen by Osama bin Laden (whose home village is not far from Aden), flying into the World Trade Center. Eight years on, Santa Barbara \u2014 like most places in the U.S.\u2014 is a lot closer to Yemen than it was then: less sure of everything, fearful of disturbances from abroad, even in places in economic ruins. No feeling person would ever say that senseless murder, the inciting of fear or loss of confidence are good things. But perhaps they ask us what the foundations of our happiness are and on what we base our rosier hopes. I met cheerful souls among the headstones in Aden, and I know a few in Santa Barbara. But if that cheer is genuine, I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019d be feeling better or worse now than they were on Sept. 11, 2001. Only more compassionate, perhaps. Looking to our circumstances for strength, solace or support is like dancing at the edge of a very deep grave. \u2014 Pico Iyer","6472":"Mr. Daniels first discussed the hijackers display on Thursday, at a news conference focusing on the museum\u2019s design.

Then at the end, when he\u2019s really worked up, he yells, \u201cAnd Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time!\u201d","6481":"Most of the assessments of Al Qaeda written for the eighth anniversary of 9/11 last week were rather harsh about the current state of Osama bin Laden\u2019s operation.","6482":"A reader of The Lede named Sarah has drawn our attention to the fact that the author of a book apparently recommended to Americans this week by Osama bin Laden has responded to the shout-out. In a comment on this blog, Sarah also pointed out that this was not the first time the leader of Al Qaeda had issued a rant on tape in favor of a book:","6483":"Osama bin Laden has released yet another new audiotape. See, they\u2019re audiotapes. I don\u2019t think he quite gets the Twitter thing. He can\u2019t \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have the opposable thumb, I guess.","6484":"Moreover, the Obama advisers said they had gotten strong cooperation in the fight against Al Qaeda, particularly from Pakistan, which has led to a string of successful capture-or-kill missions against what they call high-value targets, like the top Taliban leader in Pakistan and the son of Osama bin Laden.","6485":"Ayman al-Zawahri, the No. 2 leader of Al Qaeda, left, and other members of the terrorist group appeared in a new video released Wednesday to mark the eighth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, assailing President Obama and Arab leaders for their policies on Israel. The two-part video, titled \u201cThe West and the Dark Tunnel,\u201d also reviews the global financial crisis and other events of the past year. Osama bin Laden, who like Mr. Zawahri is believed to be hiding along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, appeared in a separate video released this month.","6486":"And you know the big surprise, Osama bin Laden was supposed to address the U.N. but he dropped out at the last minute because of mercury poisoning.","6487":"Though his own administration would fail to take effective pre-emptive action against al Qaeda, Mr. Clinton identified Osama bin Laden to Mr. Branch as a clear and present danger, who, he said, bore an eerie resemblance to the fictional villains in James Bond movies \u0097 a transnational presence owing no allegiance to a nation state and endowed, in Mr. Branch\u2019s words, with \u201cenormous private wealth and a network of operatives in many countries, including ours.\u201d","6488":"While many important facts remain unknown, those allegations alone would distinguish Mr. Zazi from nearly all the other defendants in United States terrorism cases in recent years. More often than not the earlier suspects emerged as angry young men, inflamed by the rhetoric of Osama bin Laden or his associates. Some were serious in intent. More than a few seemed to be malcontents without the organization, technical skills and financing to be much of a threat. In some cases, the subjects appeared to be influenced by informants or undercover agents who pledged to provide the weapons or even do some of the planning.","649":"The Defense Department rushed long-range B-1 and B-52 bombers to the region almost at once. But they have no obvious targets. Bombing Kabul might only create more refugees, who would most likely pour into Pakistan, potentially destabilizing a country on whom the United States is heavily dependent for intelligence on the whereabouts of the terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden. Bombing in the ruggedly mountainous countryside is problematical.","6490":"FRANKFURT \u2014 In a new recording, the leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, urged European nations on Friday to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, with a veiled threat of reprisals and an allusion to past bombings in Madrid and London.","6491":"Life at the mosque was disrupted after the attacks. Worshipers there, a large white structure with a turquoise minaret on 33rd Avenue, became deeply divided. When the imam, Mohammed Sherzad, spoke out against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, pro-Taliban members of the mosque revolted, praying in the basement or the parking lot, and eventually ousted the imam, who opened a smaller mosque nearby.","6492":"Mr. Rabiah said that he traveled to Afghanistan in October 2001 to aid refugees, but government lawyers said it was to be with Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cThe evidence in the record strongly supports al-Rabiah\u2019s explanation,\u201d Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote, citing letters that he wrote to his family describing his travels.","6493":"A new recording from Osama bin Laden urged Europe to withdraw from Afghanistan. The tape seemed particularly directed at Germany, which is on alert before parliamentary elections on Sunday. PAGE A6","6495":"The major oil producing nations have fared little better. Seventy years after the discovery of its first great reservoir, Saudi Arabia remains a medieval principality with a bare patina of modernity. The country\u2019s long reign as the world\u2019s No. 1 oil supplier has been good for the Saudi princes but a Faustian bargain for the rest of us, having led to the petrodollar-funded spread of extremism and the rise of Osama bin Laden. Post-Soviet Russia has become a kind of petro-fascist state where the head of Lukoil slavishly keeps a picture of Vladimir Putin on his desk rather than photos of his family. Venezuela is resurrecting socialism, this time as farce, under the buffoonish Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who hosts a TV talk show called \u201cAl\u00f3 Presidente\u201d while turning his national oil company into a \u201cdevelopment agency with oil wells\u201d that furthers his hold on power. Iran\u2019s whole modern history has been twisted out of shape by its oil riches, starting with the American-British coup that toppled Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 and restored Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.","6496":"Between 2002 and 2009, the view that suicide bombings are \u201coften or sometimes justified\u201d has declined, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project, from 43 percent to 12 percent in Jordan; from 26 percent to 13 percent in Indonesia; and from 33 percent to 5 percent in Pakistan (excluding some sparsely populated, embattled areas). Positive ratings for Osama bin Laden have fallen by half or more in most of the countries Pew polled.","6497":"According to the criminal complaint filed in the case, an agent posing as a senior member of a Qaeda sleeper cell befriended him, and he responded to the call. He pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden, saying \u201cI love him as I love my father,\u201d expressed anger over the invasion of Gaza by the Israelis and vowed he was \u201cready for the jihadi life,\u201d the complaint said.","6498":"All of this points up, again, the calculus that links the two wars in terms of resources and the choices that were made \u2014 and are now being re-made \u2014 in fighting them. The Bush administration made its choice, many might think fatefully, when it made its primary commitment to the war in Iraq, making Afghanistan a secondary affair \u2014 some would say a backwater \u2014 and allowing the Taliban to regroup, re-arm and rise again to the point where they have effective control, or at least deny the allies control, of as much as 70 percent of the country. In his election campaign and since, Mr. Obama has made it clear where he thinks the primary threat to the United States lies \u2014 in Afghanistan, the crucible that produced the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Even those who fear a new deterioration in the security situation in Iraq doubt that Al Qaeda will ever again thrive there as they did in the chaos of the early post-Saddam years, so deep and broad is the antipathy among Iraqis, whether Sunni, Shiite or Kurd, for the extremist doctrines of Osama bin Laden.","6499":"This is the best news I\u2019ve heard in a long time. The C.I.A. announced a brand new plan to capture Osama bin Laden. They\u2019re going to invite him to Zurich, Switzerland, to have him pick up a lifetime achievement award.","65":"American tourists were to have been singled out in those attacks, prosecutors contend. The defendants are said to have been enlisted and trained by associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Muslim militant now based in Afghanistan, who is accused of responsibility for the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","650":"MADRID, Sept. 26\u2014 Spanish authorities said today that they had arrested six men from an Islamic terrorist cell connected to Osama bin Laden who are suspected of assisting militants planning suicide attacks against American targets in Europe.","6500":"If we shudder at the idea of sitting down with Osama bin Laden, then negotiating with Iran should make us equally nauseated.","6501":"President Obama said in August, \u201cIf left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which Al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans.\u201d Some of his advisers now say the opposite: Taliban control will not lead to terrorist havens.

The Bush administration regularly cited its successes in eliminating high-level Qaeda figures, too, and yet the organization seemed to replenish itself.

I remember soldiers telling us how they had been welcomed by the locals, who gave them fresh cucumbers. As we went around the town, though, we soon met people whose houses had been raided by the American military, their belongings destroyed. We met with some young men who had just been released from American detention. They complained that after getting used to clean drinking water at the American prison, they were suffering diarrhea after again drinking the water at home. A book with the face of Osama bin Laden on its cover lay on the floor of the house where we interviewed them.","6507":"At the same time, the Bush administration also touted successes in eliminating senior Al Qaeda figures, only to find new recruits taking their place. And the Obama administration appears no closer than its predecessor in tracking down Osama bin Laden, his deputy, Ayman al-Zawarhi, or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Afghan Taliban leader.","6509":"Mr. Ghailani, a Tanzanian believed to be in his mid-30s, faces federal charges of conspiring in the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by Al Qaeda.

Nothing in their history or ours suggests that either is possible.","6511":"Thomas E. Gouttierre, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, said that \u201cas a symbolic figure, Omar is a centrifugal force for the Taliban,\u201d playing a similar role to that of Osama bin Laden in Al Qaeda. But Dr. Gouttierre credits the Taliban\u2019s success not to any military genius on the part of Mullah Omar but to more worldly advisers from Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service and Al Qaeda.","6512":"Earlier this decade, the same impatience for action and a desire to see American troops on the ground was tangible in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The speedy, and much-welcomed, involvement of Americans alongside Northern Alliance rebels against the Taliban in Afghanistan followed, and those forces quickly drove the Taliban from Kabul. But there was no similarly decisive victory against Osama bin Laden or his lieutenants. So, in the end, a lack of easy targets and eye-catching victories in Afghanistan became a problem that has festered and now confronts a new president, much as Vietnam was festering when it was handed off to Richard Nixon by Lyndon Johnson.","6513":"From the safety of a window seat 30,000 feet above the ground aboard a commercial flight to Kabul, the dangerous tribal areas and mountain ranges that separate Pakistan from southern Afghanistan are a truly majestic sight. This is one of the most rugged and dangerous parts of the world, a vast area that is completely off limits to Westerners because it is controlled by an array of Pashtun tribes loyal to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Some experts believe that Osama bin Laden continues to find refuge somewhere along these forbidding mountains eight years after the attacks of Sept. 11.","6514":"TARIM, Yemen \u2014 This remote desert valley, with its towering bluffs and ancient mud-brick houses, is probably best known to outsiders as the birthplace of Osama bin Laden\u2019s father.

If Al Qaeda has moved to Pakistan, will these troops in Afghanistan add what to the effort to defeat Al Qaeda?\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnd how much will this cost? How much in terms of more dollars? How much in terms of American blood?\u201d","6517":"General Gration said the administration\u2019s new approach was also intended to prevent Sudan, which once provided refuge to Osama bin Laden, from again serving as a terrorist haven.","6518":"McChrystal\u2019s tenure as JSOC\u2019s commander was not flawless. JSOC never got its most wanted quarry, neither Osama bin Laden nor Ayman al-Zawahiri. One of JSOC\u2019s units, Task Force 6-26, was cited for abusing detainees, many of them at a site known as Camp Nama, in Baghdad. McChrystal himself was not implicated, but at least 34 task-force members were disciplined. \u201cThere were cases where people made mistakes, and they were punished,\u201d McChrystal told me. \u201cWhat we did was establish a policy and atmosphere that said that is not what you do. That is not acceptable.\u201d","6519":"Evil repels analysis. Poets from the time of Homer have sung of war, but only a monster sings of atrocities. So, too, with journalism and scholarship. We are admonished not to ascribe rational motives to Osama bin Laden or Hitler, or to their followers. To admit of motives is to reduce the moral to the psychological, and thus to the comprehensible, and thus perhaps to the acceptable. Our understanding of unspeakable acts is limited on the one hand to the irreducible moral fact of evil, and on the other to the dynamics of mob psychology \u2014 of mass lunacy.","652":"Our goal should not be to eliminate Osama bin Laden but rather to eliminate all terrorism. We should focus on all countries that advocate terrorism or harbor and support terrorists. They should either abandon their ways or be ostracized, and we should not be allied with them.","6520":"FOR the next seven months and 10 days, Atiqullah and his men kept the three of us hostage.

Osama bin Laden\u2019s first wife \u2014 it\u2019s always the first wife \u2014 is coming out with a book that gives a rare glimpse into the personal life of the infamous al Qaeda leader. She says Osama bin Laden was very tough on their children and was a strict disciplinarian. Well there\u2019s a shock.","6525":"Well here\u2019s some good terrorist gossip. Osama bin Laden\u2019s first wife has written a book about him. And you know, typical ex-wives, they always make the guy look like the bad one.","6526":"Before 9/11, the Afghan Taliban hosted Osama bin Laden and the other leaders of Al Qaeda, but the groups are now separated geographically, their leaders under pressure from intensive manhunts. On jihadist Web sites, analysts have detected recent tensions between Al Qaeda, whose proclaimed goals are global, and the Afghan Taliban, which have recently claimed that their interests lie solely in Afghanistan.","6527":"Oh, speaking of terrorists, Osama bin Laden\u2019s first wife has written a book about him. And of course, bin Laden, very embarrassed. Imagine having a wife who\u2019s literate.

Mr. Obama also owes it to the American people that Afghanistan will never again become a sanctuary for Osama bin Laden from which to plan another strike against the United States homeland.","653":"In the Persian Gulf, it was Desert Storm following Desert Shield. Operation Infinite Reach never reached its target in the 1998 attack on Osama bin Laden. And the networks jump in with 'America's New War' or the like accompanied by theme music and colorful graphics.","6530":"This thesis has been much contested, but it holds up remarkably well. Even 9/11 didn\u2019t undo the work of \u201989. Osama bin Laden is no Hitler, and Islamism isn\u2019t in the same league as the last century\u2019s totalitarianisms. Marxism and fascism seduced the West\u2019s elite; Islamic radicalism seduces men like the Fort Hood shooter. Our enemies resort to terrorism because they\u2019re weak, and because we\u2019re so astonishingly strong.","6531":"Mr. Kashmiri, the gravestone says, was a member of Harkat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based militant group fighting in Kashmir. In the 1990s, the group also fought alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

This episode, however, does not support a broad assertion that the courts cannot protect classified information.","6535":"Walid Muhammad Salih bin Attash, known as Khallad, has told investigators that he played many roles in Al Qaeda, from acting as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden to selecting and training many of the hijackers for the Sept. 11 attacks.","6536":"Mr. Khashoggi was born into opportunity, if not outright privilege. His father was the personal physician to King Abdul-Aziz ibn Saud, the founder of the modern state of Saudi Arabia.

Preoccupied with building a costly missile defense system to counter a spurious menace from Russia and with maintaining \u201cfull spectrum dominance\u201d over the rest of the globe, most Bush administration officials blithely ignored the danger emanating from the caves of Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden and his acolytes plotted against America. Confronted by a small group of mostly Saudi nationals armed with box cutters, the central nervous system of the country\u2019s defense agencies went into a state of cataleptic shock. The only decisive action taken on 9/11 came not from the military, but from the courageous passengers who stormed the cockpit of United Airlines Flight 93, leading the hijackers to crash the plane over Pennsylvania farmland before it could reach its intended target in Washington.","6539":"He will be the most senior leader of Al Qaeda to date held to account for the mass murder of nearly 3,000 Americans, facing trial in Manhattan while his boss, Osama bin Laden, continues to elude a worldwide dragnet.","654":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26\u2014 A public accounting of the evidence against Osama bin Laden and his allies has been delayed indefinitely by an internal struggle over declassifying secret information, government officials said today.","6540":"For example, three of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most influential radical clerics \u2014 Nasir bin Hamad al-Fahd, Ali al-Khudair and Ahmed al-Khalidi (once described by Osama bin Laden as \u201cour most prominent supporter\u201d) \u2014 have disowned Mr. bin Laden.

It is not far from Tora Bora, the place where Osama bin Laden got away eight years ago. There is no electricity in Achin, and the darkness that had settled on the place just after 5 p.m. was thick and black. I half-wondered how Taliban fighters could find their way through such gloom. The cold outside was sharp enough to make one shiver.","6542":"But Mr. Holder argued that Mr. Graham was raising a \u201cred herring\u201d because the government has ample evidence to prosecute high-level terrorists like the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, should he be captured. For that reason, interrogators need not worry about giving such a detainee a lawyer in order to make sure that their initial statements after being captured could be used as evidence.","6543":"There are also those prisoners of war who we have captured and will capture in Afghanistan and other countries who will receive a trial of some sort. It is clear we need to try those suspects in a forum that achieves two primary goals\u2014two goals, I might add, that may not conflict. First, the Government must have the power to use even the most sensitive classified evidence against these suspects without compromising national security in any way, shape, or form. In addition, those who commit acts of war against the United States, particularly those who have no color of citizenship, don\u2019t deserve the same panoply of due process rights that American citizens receive.

John F. Burns, The Times\u2019s chief foreign correspondent, will be taking questions. Lars Klove for The New York Times Can more soldiers also help stabilize Pakistan? Or will talk of an \u201cexit strategy\u201d discourage deeper cooperation between America and Pakistan\u2019s leaders? How does it affect Russia and China? Did President Obama\u2019s speech help convince wary Europeans that they too should support the war with more troops \u2014 at least for now? Q. I recently heard a former ambassador from a NATO country (I prefer not to publicly identify this person here) state that it was the policy of the Pakistani government to support the Taliban, that this is not publicly known, and that while the government of Pakistan may not officially protect Bin Laden, that he is sure a unit of the Pakistani ISI (intelligence service) is covertly assigned to protect him. Could you comment on this? Dad a.k.a. Toby Toronto A. Toby, your NATO source was touching on an issue that has flared again in recent days as an irritant \u2013 though that\u2019s far too mild a term for anything of such grave menace \u2014 in relations between Pakistan and the Western powers, particularly the United States and Britain. In his West Point address, President Obama made only a passing reference to Osama bin Laden, at the point early in the speech where he referred to the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks. He noted that \u201cAl Qaeda\u2019s base of operations was in Afghanistan,\u201d and that the Taliban had refused to \u201cturn over\u201d Mr. bin Laden to the United States, leading to the original decision to dispatch American troops to Afghanistan. Later in the address, the president shifted the focus to Pakistan, saying, \u201cWe cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear.\u201d But he did not specify Mr. bin Laden as being among those terrorists, an omission that may not have been by chance. Perhaps the president chose not to highlight the fugitive status, eight years on, of a man who carries a $50 million American ransom, out of concern that he might be seen as adding a further hard-if-not-impossible benchmark by which critics can judge, in time, his decision to deploy those additional 30,000 American troops. Even President George W. Bush fell largely silent on Mr. bin Laden in his latter years in the White House \u2014 again, we might think, because the chances of catching or killing the Qaeda leader had become increasingly remote with the passage of time. I know for a fact that the overall American commander of the drive to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, Gen. Tommy Franks, was saying by 2003 that Mr. bin Laden was unlikely ever to be caught, because, as he put it, the Qaeda leader was \u201cswimming like a fish in the sea\u201d in the sanctuary of the tribal fastness on Pakistan\u2019s border with Afghanistan. In any case, Mr. bin Laden is in the news again. Last weekend, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Gordon Brown, enumerating what the combatant powers in Afghanistan would expect of Pakistan, cited approvingly the current Pakistani military offensive in the tribal territory of South Waziristan but added, \u201cWe have to ask ourselves why, eight years after Sept. 11, nobody has been able to spot or detain or get close to Osama bin Laden, nobody has been able to get close to (Ayman al) Zawahri, the No. 2 in Al Qaeda.\u201d At 10 Downing Street on Thursday, that brought a rejoinder from Pakistan\u2019s visiting prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, who said Pakistan needed \u201ccredible and actionable\u201d intelligence to hunt down the Qaeda leader, then added, \u201cI don\u2019t think Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.\u201d That brought us full cycle back to the early aftermath of the Taliban\u2019s defeat in November 2001, and the escape into Pakistan, for without doubt that was what it was, that Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri made from what seemed likely at the time to be their last stand at Tora Bora, in the mountains south of the Afghan city of Jalalabad. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chose this week, too, to release a report blaming American military commanders, principally General Franks, for failing to deploy American troops to Tora Bora in numbers that could have blocked the Qaeda leaders\u2019 escape. That report was based in part on an official history of events at Tora Bora compiled two years ago by the military\u2019s Special Operations Command, which did have troops at Tora Bora, some of them careering about on quadbikes confiscating cameras and film from Western photographers assigned to the story. British officers who were at Tora Bora told me afterward that they had urged the Americans to join in a helicopter-borne landing atop the Tora Bora mountains to block the only escape route, but that the Americans vetoed the idea, saying that the 10th Mountain Division, with the only troops available, was not equipped to cope with the bitter temperatures and drifting snows they would encounter on the 14,000-foot saddle leading from the Tora Bora heights into Pakistan. True or not, those accounts set the tone for what has, ever after, been a highly contentious issue. Although Western intelligence agencies have said repeatedly that voice-recognition technology has confirmed the authenticity of many of the bin Laden audio tapes Al Qaeda has distributed over the years, doubts that he is still alive persist, not least because he has not appeared on newly-shot videotape for years. The fact of Prime Minister Brown demanding publicly that Pakistan go after Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri tells us that Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies, which have historic ties to Pakistan\u2019s, are satisfied that the Qaeda leader is still alive, and somewhere in those hundreds of square miles of forbidding territory along Pakistan\u2019s western frontier. That, too, is the opinion of the Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, who knows more about Al Qaeda, its leaders and the Taliban than anybody I have ever met; a Pashtun speaker, and a tribal chief in his own right, he has a conduit to senior Taliban and Qaeda leaders that is unmatched, and was one of very few reporters with access to them before the Sept. 11 attacks. Interviewed on BBC radio on Thursday, Mr. Yusufzai noted that an array of top Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed in Predator drone strikes on Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas \u2013 by some accounts, as many as three-quarters of the top 20 on America\u2019s most-wanted list. And, he added, on the issue of Mr. bin Laden, \u201cWe have no sightings, we have no evidence, but there is a very great likelihood that some of the Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders are in Pakistan.\u201d I have my own convictions, based partly on my own trek up those Tora Bora mountains back in the summer of 2002, when the Times editors, addressing conflicting reports from American agencies as to whether Mr. bin Laden was alive or dead, assigned me to go back to the last place where he was known to have been before he disappeared \u2013 in a modest cluster of mud, straw and stone buildings on the lower slopes of Tora Bora. It was there, after he took sanctuary in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, that he spent much of his time, and met a number of Western reporters. The encampment had been heavily bombed, but there were hints in the rubble that bin Laden had been there until the area came under siege \u2013 plastic bags of saline drip with recent use-by dates, and other medical paraphernalia that could have been used to treat the chronic renal problems he is said to have suffered for years. And then there were the villagers using donkeys to drag tree stumps down the mountainside from areas where B-52 bombing had performed what amounted to clear-cutting. When I asked them \u2013 not one or two, but several \u2013 if they had seen Mr. bin Laden at the time of the bombing, they pointed up the mountain and told me that \u201cthe sheik,\u201d as they called him \u2014 and they described a tall, emaciated foreigner with a bushy beard \u2014 had gone that way, on horseback. \u201cHe went to Pakistan\u201d, they said. All of which leaves the question of Pakistan\u2019s complicity, or at least the connivance of elements in its military intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. What is beyond question is that the ISI has elaborate links to Afghan extremists going back to the mujahedeen struggle to drive Soviet troops from Afghanistan in the 1980s, when the ISI acted as the conduit for much of the $10 billion in American, Saudi and British weapons and finance that went to the resistance groups. Those links persisted into the 1990s, and then into this decade, encouraged by Pakistan civilian and military governments that have always seen a crucial strategic interest in maintaining influence in Afghanistan, partly for \u201cstrategic depth\u201d in Pakistan\u2019s confrontation with India, partly to guard against Pashtun nationalists on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border reviving the historic goal of a \u201cPashtunistan\u201d nation that would involve the dismemberment of Pakistan. If anybody outside the ranks of the Qaeda and Taliban leadership knows where bin Laden is, it is as likely as not to be an agent of the ISI. Q. The president claimed that a big difference between Vietnam and Afghanistan is that in the case of Vietnam the insurgency had popular support but that this is not true in Afghanistan. Is this true?

And guess what? Somebody got fat!","6621":"One of Osama bin Laden\u2019s sons has written a book. And remember how excited we all were when we captured Osama bin Laden? Oh yeah, that didn\u2019t happen.","6622":"Now here\u2019s something that I think bothers all of us. Osama bin Laden is still out doing whatever it is he does. And so the F.B.I. updated his likeness. So the F.B.I. has gotten the original photograph, and they\u2019ve enhanced it to show what Osama bin Laden looks like now. And if you\u2019re interested, you can see it. They put it on a carton of goat\u2019s milk.","6623":"The next 24 hours would transform his blog and, ultimately, his career. \u201cI grew up in Hawaii,\u201d Johnson told me recently when we met in his Los Angeles home, \u201cbut I was born in New York. After I moved away at age 10, I would read the news stories about how the World Trade Center towers were getting closer to finishing. When they were attacked that day, that really hit home for me in a way that reached back into my childhood. I\u2019ve always been kind of a voracious reader, and when I saw the attack happen, I was probably one of the first ones to make a connection with Osama bin Laden, who\u2019d declared war on America a few years earlier. It was like a huge light bulb going on over my head about this stuff, and I wanted to really learn about it, so I started posting everything I could find.\u201d","6624":"The Saudi king asked Mr. Omar for a signed letter disavowing Al Qaeda, whose leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri, are believed to be living in Pakistan under the Taliban\u2019s protection.","6625":"Mr. Eide said he did not believe that senior Taliban leaders like Mullah Omar should be removed from the list. It was Mullah Omar, after all, who provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, which launched the Sept. 11 attacks.","6626":"WASHINGTON \u0097 Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, spoke publicly for the first time about the botched Christmas Day airliner bombing, praising the attempt \u0097 but not explicitly taking responsibility for it \u0097 in an audiotape broadcast Sunday that was aimed personally at President Obama.","6627":"WASHINGTON \u0097 As the Obama administration pours 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan, it has begun grappling with the next great dilemma of this long war: whether to reconcile with the men who sheltered Osama bin Laden and who still have close ties to Al Qaeda.","6628":"Mr. Karzai\u2019s proposal went much further than the strategy preferred by many American officials, who favor luring back low- and midlevel Taliban fighters. The Obama administration is in the middle of a spirited debate over the implications of negotiating with top Taliban leaders who sheltered Osama bin Laden and still have ties to Al Qaeda.","6629":"Postscript: If you somehow missed it, Osama bin Laden, possibly recognizing that climate injustice has become a rallying cry for the world\u2019s poor countries, focused his latest audio missive on the role of the United States and other industrial powers in global warming. Rush Limbaugh certainly didn\u2019t miss the news.","663":"The crisis appeared to be giving some pause to Bush administration officials considering military strikes against targets associated with Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and the ruling Taliban government in Afghanistan. In several public statements senior officials have taken note of the palpable fear that American military operations might lead to the deaths of more Afghan civilians than the number of people killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.","6630":"And in his latest audiotape, Osama bin Laden said Al Qaeda was going to bring down one of our older monuments. You know what that meant? It was Brett Favre. They were working with New Orleans, yes.","6631":"Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, blamed the United States and developed countries for not halting climate change and said that the global economy should immediately abandon its reliance on the American dollar, according to an audiotape released Friday by the broadcaster Al Jazeera.","6632":"Osama bin Laden has released another tape. He released a tape today, blaming the United States for global warming. Well, you can tell he\u2019s running out of ideas. That\u2019s the best he\u2019s got? Hey, the United States blames the United States for global warming!","6634":"For the West, striking a deal with the Taliban leadership would be tricky as well, not least because Mullah Omar provided sanctuary to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, who masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks.","6635":"Two militant Islamist groups announced Monday that they were joining forces and that they were now part of the \u201cinternational jihad of Al Qaeda.\u201d The militants, the Shabab and a much smaller outfit called the Raskamboni Rebel Group, also pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden. The Raskamboni rebels control territory near the Kenyan border and used to be allied with another rebel group known as Hizbul Islam. The Shabab remain the most potent threat to Somalia\u2019s weak transitional government.","6636":"Holed up in his hideaway, Osama bin Laden must be congratulating himself upon hearing the news that now, more than eight years after 9/11, Americans are still so terrified of his power that they are afraid to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described 9/11 mastermind, at the scene of his crime in New York City.","6638":"There\u2019s a new Osama bin Laden video. Gosh, I mean, this guy, what is he doing, working at Blockbuster?","6639":"Well, we\u2019ve got another one of those videotapes from Osama bin Laden. I mean, they\u2019re coming like once a month now. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in a club. You sign up, you get the whole collection. Time-Life: Osama bin Laden.","664":"Mr. Cohen, graying ponytail and all, has burst, Kunstler-like, into the news as the most visible lawyer for Muslim Americans. He is playing the role with the verve of the Old Left lawyers of the 1960's. In interviews and television appearances where he discusses two Muslim clients who have been questioned by investigators, he is provocative. He says he will not rule out representing Osama bin Laden himself. Mr. Cohen calls the current investigation a witch hunt.","6640":"Yemen\u2019s former prime minister, Abdul Karim al-Iryani, got right to the point when I arrived at his Sana home for dinner: \u201cSo, Thomas, did it take Abdulmutallab to finally get you here?\u201d Yes, it is true, I admitted, because that young Nigerian, trained in Yemen by Al Qaeda, tried to blow up a Northwest jetliner on Christmas Day, I decided I had to see Yemen firsthand. I further confessed to Iryani: \u201cI was a bit worried coming here. I half expected to be met at the bottom of the stairs from my Qatar Airways flight by Osama bin Laden himself.\u201d","6641":"Osama bin Laden has released yet another audiotape message. Where does he find all these audiotapes, O.K.? You can't even buy audiotapes anymore. I mean, is there a tiny country in the Middle East called Radioshackistan?","6642":"In later years Mr. Wilson insisted that the United States had not made a mistake by supporting the Afghan rebels, among them Osama bin Laden and the Islamists who would form the Taliban regime. He said if the United States had helped rebuild Afghanistan, it would have remained stable and not become a safe haven for Al Qaeda.","6643":"The government has said that after the embassy attacks, Mr. Ghailani worked as a bodyguard and a cook for Osama bin Laden. He was captured in 2004. Last year, he became the first Guant\u00e1namo detainee ordered by President Obama to be tried in the civilian court system.","6644":"Most of Muller\u2019s strongest arguments are in his first essay, which draws on everyone from Voltaire to Osama bin Laden to illustrate how the world came to conflate the negative stereotypes of Jews with those of capitalism\u2019s excesses. The book\u2019s remaining three essays deal somewhat unevenly with the fallout of the Jews\u2019 economic success, and in particular the resentment it inspired among history\u2019s economic also-rans. Muller explores, for example, how Jews improbably became associated with both abhorred poles of political economy: hypercapitalism and \u00adCommunism.","6645":"Or again, whenever perplexed Americans fret over Osama bin Laden or suicide killings, and delude themselves that material progress will cure these ills, I think of what Orwell wrote in 1940 about another charismatic monster. \u201cHitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\u2019t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice. . . . However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life.\u201d","6646":"And while we\u2019re on the cheery topic of death, I\u2019m just waiting for Osama bin Laden to start his own withering critique of the tax code. You might think it would be out of character, but in fact, Mr. bin Laden has lately emerged as a kind of self-styled economic guru. We all need to branch out, right?","6647":"Finally, also in 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Arab and Muslim mujahedeen fighters flocked to the cause \u2014 financed by Saudi Arabia at America\u2019s behest \u2014 and in the process shifted Pakistan and Afghanistan in much more Islamist directions. Once these hard-core Muslim fighters, led by the likes of Osama bin Laden, defeated the Soviets, they turned their guns on America and its Arab allies.","6648":"The judge said Monday that some of the seized material glorified Osama bin Laden and included graphic images of violence involving hostages, ABC Radio reported.","6649":"The commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, is an Afghan described by American officials as the most significant Taliban figure to be detained since the American-led war in Afghanistan started more than eight years ago. He ranks second in influence only to Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban\u2019s founder and a close associate of Osama bin Laden before the Sept. 11 attacks.","665":"Two of the prisoners here, the more educated and the seemingly more determined, who say they have been interviewed scores of times, claim to have been schooled in hijacking and bomb-making at the training camps of Osama bin Laden, the wanted terrorist.","6650":"The judge said Monday that some of the seized material glorified Osama bin Laden and included graphic images of violence involving hostages, ABC Radio reported.","6651":"In June 1998, the office secretly indicted Osama bin Laden. Three months later, Al Qaeda blew up the two embassies.","6652":"In today\u2019s world of suicide bombers and a ravaged economy, it all seems not merely frivolous, but ludicrous. And it\u2019s especially disconcerting to think that while so many were preoccupied by Clinton\u2019s \u201cdistinguishing characteristic,\u201d Osama bin Laden was most likely preoccupied with attacking the United States.","6653":"The premise of the book, the quote from which the title is taken \u2014 \u201cWhen people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature, they will like the strong horse\u201d \u2014 is Osama bin Laden\u2019s. Perhaps I just don\u2019t want bin Laden to be right, but I don\u2019t believe Arabs prefer the strong horse; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s all too easy for the violent few to hold the majority hostage.","6654":"To be sure, a signi\ufb01cant part of the Middle East, including Osama bin Laden, is at war expressly with the United States. And there are genuine points of con\ufb02ict between the lands of Islam and the West, including a religious rivalry that dates back to the appear\u00adance of the Quran and myriad regional confrontations to which the United States' strategic interests make us party. But these con\ufb02icts are just part of a system of wars that involves the entire Middle East. We are now incontrovertibly a part of these wars, but their causes and sources are to be found in the region itself, and not at the lower end of Manhattan, or even in the halls of the Pentagon. September 11 is the day we woke up to \ufb01nd ourselves in the middle of a clash of Arab civilizations, a war that used American cities as yet another venue for Arabs to \ufb01ght each other.","6655":"KABUL, Afghanistan \u0097 Hajji Zaman Ghamsharik, the Afghan warlord accused of helping Osama bin Laden escape from the Americans at Tora Bora, had so many enemies that his assassination on Monday came as no particular surprise.","6656":"Also on Monday, Hajji Zaman Ghamsharik, an Afghan warlord accused of helping Osama bin Laden escape from the Americans at Tora Bora, was assassinated by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest. The bomber killed him and 14 others as they gathered at a ceremony to distribute land to returning refugees at a village in his tribal stomping grounds near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.","6657":"Overreaction was a reasonable thing for him to hope for, given the way America reacted the last time terrorist-flown aircraft hit American buildings. And the fact that he hoped for it may be yet another reason to consider him a terrorist; strategically, he thought just as Osama bin Laden does. But maybe our best revenge against both of these terrorists would be to avoid describing them that way. Postscript (added after reading a few dozen angry comments): Just to clarify a few things: 1) When I said in this column that you could in principle follow my logic to conclude that Joseph Stack was a Tea Party terrorist, I should have added the explicit reminder that this logic depended on accepting the somewhat squishy definition of \u201cTea Party\u201d ideology that, I argue, is appropriate given the still-inchoate nature of the movement; 2) I\u2019m of course not saying that Stack has much in common with the average law-abiding Tea Partier (any more than Osama bin Laden has much in common with the average law-abiding Muslim or law-abiding Islamist) \u2014 even though I do think that intense rage, which Stack evinced so violently, can be found on the movement\u2019s fringes; 3) I\u2019m definitely not, as some commenters seem to think, saying that Stack is a conservative terrorist. Indeed, my point is that the Tea Party movement is still undefined enough to accommodate ideologically eclectic people. However, I think commenters who take the Stack manifesto\u2019s closing reference to the Communist Manifesto as a sign of communist sympathies are misreading his intent; and I suspect his closing characterization of capitalism isn\u2019t meant as a rejection of free-market economics but rather as a complaint that capitalism has become corrupted in America. I think the overall point of those two references is that capitalism, as it\u2019s being corruptly practiced, is no better than communism, and may be worse. But there will never be any way of knowing for sure what he meant. Bibliography: On the populist nature of Tea Partiers, and the attraction of some of them to conspiracy theories, see this New York Times piece. On the small but nonetheless unsettling following that Stack has attracted since his suicide mission, see this A.P. story that ran in The Washington Post and elsewhere. A recent survey sheds a bit of light on the views of people who see themselves as sympathizing with Tea Partiers. The publicly released version of the data says little about the much smaller number of respondents who had actually participated in Tea Party events, but, interestingly, Ramesh Ponnuru, who co-authored an analysis of the survey that was published in National Review, tells me that about one-third of these Tea Partiers reported having voted for Obama.","6658":"The case involves Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who faces charges stemming from the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa. He later worked for Osama bin Laden as a bodyguard and cook, the government has said.","6659":"IT is not often that you see an old comrade in arms of Osama bin Laden hoisting the American flag outside his home.","666":"MESSAGE TO BIN LADEN -- The Taliban said a courier had delivered their request to Osama bin Laden to leave Afghanistan.

Liz Cheney\u2019s crackpot hit squad achieved instant notoriety with its viral video demanding the names of Obama Justice Department officials who had served as pro bono defense lawyers for Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. The video branded these government lawyers as \u201cthe Al Qaeda Seven\u201d and juxtaposed their supposed un-American activities with a photo of Osama bin Laden. As if to underline the McCarthyism implicit in this smear campaign, the Cheney ally Marc Thiessen (one of the two former Bush speechwriters now serving as Washington Post columnists) started spreading these charges on television with a giggly, repressed hysteria uncannily reminiscent of the snide Joe McCarthy henchman Roy Cohn.","6667":"He was also the only leader who could keep Al Qaeda out of Afghanistan or in abeyance, including Osama bin Laden, he said.

Let\u2019s provide a little background for readers who don\u2019t what an AK-74 is, and how it\u2019s different from the AK-47 and its knockoffs. First, we have to account for the manifest confusion that can be caused by the digits 47 and 74. Each indicates the year, 1947 and 1974, that the weapons were designed. Some people read the acronym AK-74 and think it\u2019s just a typo; in fact the AK-74 is a different Soviet-era rifle. It\u2019s derivative of the AK-47 that shoots a smaller, faster round. It also has other modest design changes, including a distinctly different muzzle. It first saw combat use in the Soviet war in Afghanistan, where it was carried by many Soviet troops. Osama bin Laden has an affinity for one of its variants, which appeared in the first video he made after the attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001.","6805":"In recent weeks, information from various sources has indicated that Al Qaeda may be planning a large-scale attack on the West.

On Oct. 4, an American drone attack in North Waziristan killed 11 jihadists, at least five of whom had German citizenship.

It alerted Washington to the threat so that officials could locate and defuse the packages. Once known as the home base of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the country too often has been a reluctant ally in the fight against extremists.

It initially focused on plotting against the Saudi monarchy and the Yemeni government and continues to carry out attacks in the region. The group trained and equipped Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian who tried to blow up an airliner over Detroit last Dec. 25, and its rhetoric has increasingly echoed the central Qaeda goal of attacking the United States.","683":"Intelligence officials suspect that Osama bin Laden, the fugitive terrorist, may be hiding in this kind of maze somewhere across the border in Afghanistan.

The fighting started just before independence from joint British and Egyptian colonial control in 1956, with the southerners, who are predominantly black and who practice, for the most part, traditional animist religions or Christianity, battling for freedom or partial separation from Khartoum\u2019s Arab and Islamic rule. In 1972, an accord was reached, allowing the South a measure of autonomy; but in 1978, Chevron discovered oil just to the southern side of the North-South line. It wasn\u2019t long before Khartoum decided that the South\u2019s semi-autonomy, which included resources and revenues, wasn\u2019t a good idea. In 1983, Khartoum effectively reunified the country. It declared, too, that Shariah law would be imposed throughout the nation. Southern rebels quickly stormed one of Chevron\u2019s bases and resumed their resistance against the North. In the early \u201990s, the rebels became appealing freedom fighters in the eyes of the U.S. government. This was partly because the Khartoum regime supported Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait and provided a home for numerous jihadists, including Osama bin Laden, earning Khartoum a spot on America\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism. And it was partly because Christian evangelicals saw the southern cause as a movement of religious brethren.","6837":"McCain stressed that we should not make this sort of change while we\u2019re in a bad economy and two long-running wars.

I have been accused of treason, even though I am an Australian, not a U.S., citizen. There have been dozens of serious calls in the U.S. for me to be \u201ctaken out\u201d by U.S. special forces.

American strategists have indicated that their objectives -- chief among them capturing Osama bin Laden and fellow terrorists, and punishing the Taliban -- would be far more limited.","6840":"An authoritarian regime, he says, oppresses people and keeps its plans secret from the oppressed. Transparency rips the veil off, exposing these plots. And radical transparency \u2014 like the WikiLeaks data dump \u2014 makes authoritarian regimes guarded in their future internal communications.

Under pressure from the United States and Saudi Arabia, Sudan expelled him, and he settled in Afghanistan, where the Taliban provided him a haven.","6850":"But, one may object, if the wrongdoer is unforgivable, then both interpersonal forgiveness and political apology are impossible (one can pronounce the words, but the moral deed cannot be done).\u00a0 Are any wrongdoers unforgivable?\u00a0 People who have committed heinous acts such as torture or child molestation are often cited as examples.\u00a0 The question is not primarily about the psychological ability of the victim to forswear anger, but whether a wrongdoer can rightly be judged not-to-be-forgiven no matter what offender and victim say or do.\u00a0 I do not see that a persuasive argument for that thesis can be made; there is no such thing as the unconditionally unforgivable.\u00a0 For else we would be faced with the bizarre situation of declaring illegitimate the forgiveness reached by victim and perpetrator after each has taken every step one could possibly wish for.\u00a0 The implication may distress you: Osama bin Laden, for example, is not unconditionally unforgivable for his role in the attacks of 9/11.\u00a0 That being said, given the extent of the injury done by grave wrongs, their author may be rightly unforgiven for an appropriate period even if he or she has taken all reasonable steps.\u00a0 There is no mathematically precise formula for determining when it is appropriate to forgive.","6851":"James Esber: \u2018You, Me and Everyone Else\u2019; closes on Friday. A mildly hallucinatory one-rogue rogue\u2019s gallery, this exhibition presents more than 100 similar yet different drawings of Osama bin Laden. It is a perverse celebration of community and collaboration, as all are tracings made by relatives and friends of the artist from a bin Laden portrait he made in 2005. A solo show\u2019s worth of Esber works are mixed in, including woozy Plasticine reliefs of people who have figured only fleetingly and accidentally in the news (unlike bin Laden) and a series of sly, radiantly colored paintings whose perforated forms, patched surfaces and borrowed images offer their own meditations on war and violence.

It contained a photograph of the president and Mrs. Obama with another couple and a personal inscription to, yes, David Harris and his wife. Only it wasn\u2019t me, but yet another namesake, prompting me to ask whether our country might be having difficulty finding Osama bin Laden because there\u2019s more than one fellow out there with the same name.","6853":"Washington has tough sanctions on Sudan, as a result of its early harboring of Osama bin Laden and then Mr. Bashir\u2019s genocidal war in Darfur. To encourage a successful referendum, President Obama offered to remove Sudan from Washington\u2019s terrorism list and eventually loosen other sanctions. He showed good will already by allowing some agricultural sales to the north.","6854":"In September, five more Frenchmen, along with two Africans, were kidnapped in northern Niger on the site of a uranium mine worked by French companies. They are thought by French officials to be held in the northeast of Mali. In November, AQIM demanded that France negotiate the freedom of the hostages with Osama bin Laden and pull its troops out of Afghanistan.","6855":"Scott, we have a range of national interests in Sudan, and in particular avoiding a failed state there. Remember that Osama bin Laden used to make his home in Khartoum, and there\u2019s certainly a potential for the northern part of the country to incubate terrorists again \u2014 or for the south, if it fell apart, to become a refuge of groups like the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army. And failed states export refugees and perpetuate diseases in ways that do challenge us: if we want to eradicate polio and Guinea worm, we need to keep South Sudan together. What\u2019s more, South Sudan is going to be a significant oil exporter \u2014 and it\u2019s in the interest of all of us that that oil gets out onto world markets. But the larger point I would make is that we not only have national interests, but also national values. And if war resumes in Sudan or the country shatters, then hundreds of thousands of people will die. We may see another genocide. That would rouse us from our stupor, and we\u2019d eventually spend billions of dollars trying to resolve the crisis \u2014 but one of the lessons of history is that it is far, far cheaper to avert a war than to end one. So that\u2019s where our interests and values converge, and that\u2019s why what we\u2019re seeing today in South Sudan is so exciting. This does look as if international engagement may have helped avert a war that only a few months ago looked quite likely. Touch wood. \u2014 Nicholas Kristof","6856":"This also came up in a bloggingheads conversation with Michelle Goldberg, so let me clarify: In suggesting that the attempted murder of a Democratic congresswoman could redound to the benefit of her political party, I was by no means suggesting that liberals \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind\u201d seeing a Democratic politician gunned down, because it might give them a boost at the polls. That would be at once offensive and absurd. Rather, I was expressing what I thought was just a truism of American politics\u00a0\u2014 namely, that assassination attempts and other outbreaks of violence against politicians or public institutions usually make their targets more sympathetic and more popular, and inspire a general \u201crally-round-the-flag\u201d effect that benefits (and is often effectively exploited by) whichever party occupies the Oval Office. This pattern has held regardless of the identity of the perpetrator and his motivations for violence: It was true with John Hinckley, true with Timothy McVeigh, true with Osama bin Laden. And I assumed that it would be true in this case as well, whatever Jared Lee Loughner\u2019s specific reasons for shooting Gabrielle Giffords turned out to be.","6857":"He begins by emphasizing the subtle long-term costs of early Western victories: how the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors undercut socialist Arab nationalism and instead spurred the rise of Islamic extremism; how the Persian Gulf war deployments of 1990-91 humiliated Arabs and intensified the \u00adanti-Americanism of Osama bin Laden and others. We did not notice it, but the war began back then. The first Qaeda attack against Americans came a year later, in Yemen. And the year after that, Bergen reports, Al Qaeda may have been involved in the \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d battles in Mogadishu, Somalia.","6858":"What makes \u201cThe Longest War,\u201d a new book by Peter L. Bergen, CNN\u2019s national security analyst, particularly useful is that it provides a succinct and compelling overview of these huge, complex subjects, drawing upon other journalists\u2019 pioneering work as well as the author\u2019s own expertise in terrorism and interviews with a broad spectrum of figures including leading counterterrorism officials, members of the Taliban, failed suicide bombers, family and friends of Osama bin Laden and top American military officers.","6859":"The government also did not introduce statements Mr. Ghailani made before he was brought into the civilian system, even though prosecutors said they amounted to a confession. For example, he said a plotter had told him of the plans to attack the embassy in Tanzania \u201cabout a week before it was bombed,\u201d a statement Mr. Ghailani has conceded making voluntarily, prosecutors said. The jury also never heard allegations that during Mr. Ghailani\u2019s six years as a fugitive, he trained with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and worked as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.","686":"Rudy Giuliani is being mercurial again. Nostradamus is falling off the best-seller list. CNN's ratings have dropped 70 percent from their post-attack peak. Jay Leno delivers a joke linking Osama bin Laden to Anna Nicole Smith. (Had it been funny, I'd repeat it.) Scattered among the bulletins of widespread layoffs are austere TV commercials in slo-mo black-and-white in which corporations pledge their solidarity with the American spirit.","6860":"The United States initially handled the Cole attack as a peacetime terrorism crime, but the government now contends that a state of armed conflict had legally existed since 1996, when Osama bin Laden declared war against the United States.","6861":"Updated | 5:10 p.m. The news that Osama bin Laden, or someone impersonating him, released a new audio message on Friday has been greeted with as little fanfare as reports on Thursday that Terry Jones, the pastor of a Florida microchurch, was denied permission to enter Britain to address 30 fans of his work.","6862":"PARIS \u2014 An audio message attributed to Osama bin Laden warned Friday that the fate of French hostages held by Islamic militants would hinge on the withdrawal of French forces from Afghanistan.

That ideology still has a powerful hold on people\u2019s imaginations across the region, which continues to feed fighters to jihadist movements. But like Arabism and socialism before it, the political Islam of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran and the radicalized ideology of Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden have failed to deliver in practical ways for the millions of people across the Middle East who live in bastions of autocratic rule.","6867":"Around 2000, Osama bin Laden was visiting a guesthouse in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when one of his aides approached a Tanzanian man who was staying there.","6868":"Around 2000, Osama bin Laden was visiting a guesthouse in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when one of his aides approached a Tanzanian man who was staying there.

American officials would not say whether intelligence operatives or commando units were in Afghanistan in recent days. A1","6870":"Mr. Ghailani\u2019s case had always conveyed layers of added significance. From a policy standpoint, the trial was seen as a test of President Obama\u2019s intention of trying military detainees in civilian court \u201cwhenever feasible.\u201d From a terrorism perspective, Mr. Ghailani was viewed as a bridge between two distinct eras: before and after 9/11, when Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden emerged even more prominently.","6872":"A prominent Brotherhood thinker, Sayyid Qutb, who was imprisoned by the Egyptian government and executed in 1966, was an important theorist of violent jihad and a spiritual progenitor of Osama bin Laden, the founder of Al Qaeda, and Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical preacher now hiding in Yemen. But the Brotherhood took a different direction after Mr. Qutb\u2019s death, and Qaeda leaders came to hold the organization in contempt.","6873":"Among the findings, the senators said, was that government officials knew Major Hasan had communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and terrorism suspect now residing in Yemen, but failed to alert the Army of this fact; that from 2003 to 2009, when he was a psychiatric resident at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, he openly suggested that revenge might be a defense for the Sept. 11 attacks; and that he spoke defensively about Osama bin Laden.","6874":"The statement described Mr. Gul as \u201can admitted Taliban recruiter and commander of a military base in Jalalabad\u201d who operated a guesthouse for Al Qaeda. It said he also admitted meeting with Osama bin Laden \u201cand providing him with operational assistance on several occasions.\u201d","6875":"If democracy gains in the Middle East, there will be some demagogues, nationalists and jingoists, just as there are in America and Israel, and they may make diplomacy more complicated. But remember that it\u2019s Mr. Mubarak\u2019s repression, imprisonment and torture that nurtured angry extremists like Ayman al-Zawahri of Al Qaeda, the right-hand man of Osama bin Laden. It would be tragic if we let our anxieties impede our embrace of freedom and democracy in the world\u2019s most populous Arab nation.","6876":"The report argues that Taliban leaders did not know of the Sept. 11 attacks in advance and that they appeared to have been manipulated by Osama bin Laden, who then lived in Afghanistan.","6877":"None of these will come easily, and some setbacks are certain. But Egyptians have finally won a chance at creating a free and just society. We can think of no better rebuttal to Osama bin Laden and other extremists. The Egyptian protesters inspire us all. They will need all of our support.","6878":"\u201cAye, aye! they were mine \u2014 my irons, cried Ahab, exultantly. . . . Aye, I see \u2014 wanted to part it; free the fast fish \u2014 an old trick \u2014 I know him.\u201d For a good generation now, the former chief of the C.I.A.\u2019s bin Laden unit, Michael Scheuer, has insisted that he knew the tricks of Osama bin Laden, that he was on to him from the start, that he and the unit he headed from 1996 to 1999 had given the government multiple chances to kill or capture the Saudi master terrorist. The bureaucracy had not gone along; indecisive leaders who didn\u2019t know the man they were trying to snag, who didn\u2019t read his writings, had thwarted and betrayed the hunt. And still, after the calamities, after all the disasters inflicted upon us by this elusive and cunning adversary, we haven\u2019t yet understood what we are up against. A view has crystallized that the trail of terror now goes beyond bin Laden, that the man on the run no longer pulls the strings of the jihad. Scheuer has come forth to challenge this complacency.","6879":"Perhaps the most difficult question to answer is the level of corruption involving Hosni Mubarak himself. Former American diplomats said he appeared to live relatively simply, particularly by the standards of rulers in the region. His main residence outside Cairo was a villa in a private compound in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheik, where he went after resigning the presidency on Friday. Diplomats said the villa was not particularly grand for the neighborhood, smaller than the nearby home of Bakr bin Laden, a member of the wealthy Saudi construction clan and a half-brother of Osama bin Laden.","688":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 28\u2014 A last-ditch effort by Pakistan to persuade Afghanistan's ruling Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden failed today when a group of militant Islamic clerics flew back to Pakistan and reported that the Taliban's leader had dismissed any possibility of a handover.","6880":"Too many Americans bought into a lazy stereotype that Arab countries were inhospitable for democracy, or that the beneficiaries of popular rule would be extremists like Osama bin Laden. Tunisians and Egyptians have shattered that stereotype, and the biggest loser will be Al Qaeda. We don\u2019t know what lies ahead for Egypt \u2014 and there is a considerable risk that those in power will attempt to preserve Mubarakism without Mr. Mubarak \u2014 but already Egyptians have demonstrated the power of nonviolence in a way that undermines the entire extremist narrative. It will be fascinating to see whether more Palestinians embrace mass nonviolent protests in the West Bank as a strategy to confront illegal Israeli settlements and land grabs.","6881":"The disengagement from public life that followed has had real costs. Isolated justices make isolated decisions. It is difficult to imagine justices who drank regularly with presidents deciding that a lawsuit against a sitting executive could go forward while he was in office, or imagining that the suit would not take up much of the president\u2019s time. Yet that is precisely what the court did by a 9-to-0 vote in the 1997 case of Clinton v. Jones. The court\u2019s mistaken practical judgment opened the door to President Bill Clinton\u2019s testimony about Monica Lewinsky and the resulting impeachment that preoccupied the government for more than two years as Osama bin Laden laid his plans.","6882":"There are tears in his eyes now. There are tears in Kassem\u2019s, too. He pulls up his pants to his knee, revealing a terrible black scar on his calf. She cannot look. Why this treatment? \u201cThey wanted to know if I knew Osama bin Laden.\u201d","6883":"As Reuters reports, Libyans were puzzled by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s bizarre tirade on state television on Thursday in which he claimed that young Libyans \u201cfueled by milk and Nescafe spiked with hallucinogenic drugs,\u201d were fighting not for their freedom but for Al Qaeda\u2019s leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri.","6884":"Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s evident frustration at the resistance in Zawiyah spilled out in a rant by telephone over the state television network charging that Osama bin Laden had drugged the town\u2019s youth into a rebellious frenzy.","6885":"As one threat seemed to vanish, the Egyptian prison system remained an open sore. The movement that included Mr. Rahman gave way to one led by Osama bin Laden and his top collaborator, an Egyptian doctor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.","6886":"Our mission was to find Osama bin Laden, and we failed. Our mission was to defeat the Taliban, and we failed. Our mission was to curtail the growth and distribution of opium, which strengthens the Taliban, and we failed.","6887":"Colonel Qaddafi long saw Al Qaeda as a grave threat to his rule, and was the first to request an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden through Interpol, said Bruce Hoffman, director of the center for peace and security studies at Georgetown University. But the reality is more nuanced.","6888":"But when government-paid drivers and minders took visiting journalists on an official tour to visit here Sunday morning, they found a town firmly in rebel hands, where Libyan officials and military units did not even try to enter. It was the second consecutive day that an official tour appeared to do more to discredit than bolster the government\u2019s line, and questions arose about the true allegiance of the official tour minders, who appeared to mingle easily with people of rebel-held Zawiyah. Some suggested that the Qaddafi government might in fact have believed its own propaganda: that the journalists would discover in Zawiyah radical Islamists or young people crazed by drugs supplied by Osama bin Laden.","6889":"In fact, the motley opposition movements that have appeared so suddenly and proved so powerful have shunned the two central tenets of the Qaeda credo: murderous violence and religious fanaticism. The demonstrators have used force defensively, treated Islam as an afterthought and embraced democracy, which is anathema to Osama bin Laden and his followers.","689":"HAMBURG, Germany, Sept. 28\u2014 In the hours following the Sept. 11 terror attacks, German intelligence agents intercepted a phone conversation between jubilant followers of Osama bin Laden that led the F.B.I. to search frantically for two more teams of suicide hijackers, according to officials in both countries.","6890":"American officials expressed concern about the statement of the cleric, Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a one-time mentor of Osama bin Laden, which introduced a new Islamist element to the turmoil in a country where Al Qaeda is viewed as a grave threat. The protests that toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and that now have spread to Libya, Bahrain and Oman have been largely secular in nature.","6891":"A security official said the diplomat was exchanged for high-level Qaeda operatives, including Saiful Adil, an important figure who was the organization\u2019s commander for external operations and had been in Iranian custody since 2001, as well as some families of Qaeda members. A daughter and a son of Osama bin Laden were allowed to leave Iran at that time, and Pakistani officials said their release from house arrest was part of the deal to gain Mr. Attarzadeh\u2019s freedom.","6892":"Since YouTube relies on viewers to flag objectionable material, and only a fraction of Mr. Awlaki\u2019s videos violates its rules, it was never likely that his pronouncements would disappear from the site. Even if they did, scores of other sites without YouTube\u2019s rules also host the declarations \u2014 written, audio or video \u2014 of Mr. Awlaki, the man some have called the Osama bin Laden of the Internet.","6893":"Ever since 9/11, the West has hoped for a war of ideas within the Muslim world that would feature an internal challenge to the violent radical Islamic ideology of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. That contest, though, never really materialized because the regimes we counted on to promote it found violent Muslim extremism a convenient foil, so they allowed it to persist. Moreover, these corrupt, crony capitalist Arab regimes were hardly the ideal carriers for an alternative to bin Ladenism. To the contrary, it was their abusive behavior and vicious suffocation of any kind of independent moderate centrist parties that fueled the extremism even more.","6894":"He blamed the protests on drugs distributed by Osama bin Laden, and he has insisted that a radical Islamist emir had taken over a city in the east, imposed Islamic law and begun daily executions of those who violated it.","6895":"Didn\u2019t we arm the rebels in Afghanistan in the \u201980s? And didn\u2019t many become Taliban and end up turning our own weapons on us? And didn\u2019t one mujahadeen from Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden, go on to lead Al Qaeda?","6896":"\u201cOsama bin Laden. Carlos the Jackal. The Unabomber. Charles Manson. O. J.

While a host at MTV UK, he went to work dressed up as Osama bin Laden. At the network\u2019s annual music awards, he likened Britney Spears to a \u201cfemale Christ.\u201d And he was fired from the BBC after leaving raunchy messages on the voice mail of a 78-year-old actor, a comic bit that even his country\u2019s then-prime minister felt compelled to denounce.","69":"The French police detained a terror suspect linked to the network of Osama bin Laden and to an Islamic fundamentalist cell in Canada that plotted to bomb American targets.

Arguing that Al Qaeda deserved some indirect credit for the uprisings, he said the United States\u2019 willingness to drop its support for Mr. Mubarak and other authoritarian leaders was a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the Sept. 11 attacks.","6905":"Mr. Benotman is a former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which fought Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s government in the 1990s. He works to combat the radicalization of Muslims and has described his own doomed effort, in 2000, to convince his former associates Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to abandon violence.","6906":"Some paintings explore political and social themes. Mudflaps are illustrated with handguns or pipes of ganja. One black-and-white painting depicts Mr. Bush and Saddam Hussein, side by side, both looking uncomfortable. Osama bin Laden appears in one painting, his forefinger pointed upward as if delivering a lecture.","6907":"Or it could have been placed in yet another series that began in 1998 and charged Osama bin Laden with leading a global conspiracy to kill Americans, which included the bombings of two American embassies in Africa. Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, the Guant\u00e1namo detainee tried in the civilian system last year, was part of that case.","6909":"For many actual Democrats, Mr. Chambliss remains negatively defined by his 2002 defeat of Senator Max Cleland, a triple-amputee veteran of Vietnam, after a campaign that included an ad picturing Mr. Cleland with Osama bin Laden. Mr. Chambliss\u2019s work on the Gang of Six has done as much as anything to soften attitudes.","691":"The myths and realities of Osama bin Laden swirl together like the smoke over the ruins of the World Trade Center and its thousands of dead. Who is this man?","6910":"He was a tank driver in the Libyan Army in the 1980s, when the Central Intelligence Agency was spending billions to support religious militants trying to drive Soviet troops out of Afghanistan. Mr. Qumu moved to Afghanistan in the early 1990s, just as Osama bin Laden and other former mujahedeen were violently turning against their former benefactor, the United States.","6911":"So in 2004 Mr. Shah was sent back to Afghanistan \u2014 where he promptly revealed himself to be Abdullah Mehsud, a Pakistan-born militant, and began plotting mayhem. He recorded jihadist videos, organized a Taliban force to fight American troops, planned an attack on Pakistan\u2019s interior minister that killed 31 people, oversaw the kidnapping of two Chinese engineers, and finally detonated a suicide bomb in 2007 as the Pakistani Army closed in. His martyrdom was hailed in an audio message by none other than Osama bin Laden.","6912":"In a package of articles called The Guant\u00e1namo Files, a team of my colleagues reports today on the release of more than 700 classified military documents that provide new and detailed accounts of the men who have done time at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison in Cuba, and offer new insight into the evidence against the 172 men still locked up there. The Guant\u00e1namo files were part of a huge trove of documents leaked last year to the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks. They were made available to The New York Times by another source on the condition of anonymity. National Public Radio and the British newspaper The Guardian are also producing reports based on the documents. Read more about the background in this Note to Readers. 2:14 P.M.Pakistan\u2019s ISI Is Again Criticized for Terror Ties The latest cache of documents presents a critical view of Pakistan\u2019s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, asserting that the intelligence agency has been supporting the Taliban and Islamist militants and including it in a list of 60 organizations that are characterized as \u201cterrorist\u201d organizations and may have provided support to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or \u201cengaged in hostilities against U.S. and coalition forces.\u201d For example, one Afghan detainee held since 2007, Haroon al Afghani, is described as having attended an August 2006 meeting with Qaeda operatives, senior Taliban officials and members of Pakistan\u2019s military and intelligence services. The view that ISI is linked with terror attacks is not new. It\u2019s consistent with one presented in a previous batch of WikiLeak documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. More recently, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivered an unusually harsh message on the ISI during his visit to Islamabad last week. Admiral Mullen said that the ISI directly supported and abetted the Haqqani network of militants in North Waziristan. The network\u2019s militants are responsible for many of the American casualties in Afghanistan, American commanders say. The United States has long held that the Haqqani network was supported by the Pakistani spy agency, but it rarely says so publicly. Despite the ongoing tensions with ISI, the organization receives more than $1 billion a year from the United States. 12:12 P.M.Al Qaeda\u2019s Signature Timepiece Among the most revealing of the leaked documents is a 17-page guide for analysts, evidently prepared by military intelligence trainers, on how to gauge the danger posed by a detainee. It lists major clusters of detainees, including the so-called Dirty 30, who were the bodyguards of Osama bin Laden, as well as the large group of accused Qaeda operatives captured with Abu Zubaydah, an important terrorist facilitator, at two guest houses in Faisalabad, Pakistan, in 2002. Among the more novel details of the guide is the assertion that a Casio F91W digital watch might be an indication of a detainee\u2019s ties to Al Qaeda. Specifically, the documents contend that the watches were handed out at a Qaeda bomb-making course. The Casio F91W watch References to the Casio watch turn up in 100 documents posted by The Times.","6913":"But Mr. Paracha\u2019s assessment suggests that he did not deny militant connections at the highest level. \u201cDetainee claimed he met UBL on a trip to Afghanistan in December 1999 or January 2000,\u201d the documents say, using the government\u2019s initials for Osama bin Laden.

Mr. Esber\u2019s original portrait, based on an unspecified media image, is not on view, but we can guess from the hundred-plus copies here that it\u2019s a mass of lines and squiggles, more of an elaborate doodle than a faithfully rendered portrait. As in many old master paintings, where the hand of the artist becomes a mark of authentication, the signatures on the drawings around the room practically supersede the images themselves, becoming \u2014 like Ms. Gangloff\u2019s paintings \u2014 a collective portrait of the artistic community Mr. Esber inhabits.","6917":"As my colleague Helene Cooper reports, Osama bin Laden has been killed, according to a United States official.

But reporters in Washington suspected almost immediately that the announcement could be about bin Laden.","692":"It was three more years before Mr. Mohamed got his call. Four months after that, he helped bomb the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania, one of two attacks in East Africa that day that killed 224 people and were attributed squarely to Al Qaeda and its founder, Osama bin Laden.","6920":"WASHINGTON \u2014President Obama announced late Sunday that Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, was killed in a firefight during an operation he ordered Sunday inside Pakistan, ending a 10-year manhunt for the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist. American officials were in possession of his body, he said.","6921":"But the wave of further violence that seemed inevitable in those fraught months after 9/11 never materialized within our borders. And what seemed like the horrifying opening offensive in a new and terrifying war stands instead as an isolated case \u2014 a passing moment when Al Qaeda seemed to rival fascism and Communism as a potential threat to our civilization, and when Osama bin Laden inspired far more fear and trembling than his actual capabilities deserved.","6922":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the most devastating attack on American soil in modern times and the most hunted man in the world, was killed in a firefight with United States forces in Pakistan, President Obama announced on Sunday.","6923":"Osama bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan on Monday, was a son of the Saudi elite whose radical, violent campaign to recreate a seventh-century Muslim empire redefined the threat of terrorism for the 21st century.","6924":"Following is the text of President Obama\u2019s remarks Sunday night announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden, as released by the White House:","6925":"In the midnight darkness, the crowds gathered, chanting and cheering, waving American flags, outside the front gates of the White House. In Times Square, tourists poured out of nearby hotels and into the streets early Monday morning to celebrate with strangers. And in the shadow of the World Trade Center site, as the news of Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing by American special forces spread, a police car drove north on Church Street blaring the sound of bagpipes from open windows. Officers raised clenched fists in the air.","6926":"THE PRESIDENT: Good evening. Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who\u2019s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.","6927":"WASHINGTON -- President Obama\u2019s announcement late Sunday that Osama bin Laden had been killed delivered not only a long-awaited prize to the United States, but also a significant victory for Mr. Obama, whose foreign policy has been the subject of persistent criticism by his rivals.","6928":"The nation\u2019s television anchors and newspaper editors did not know, at first, that President Obama would be announcing the death of Osama bin Laden, an extraordinary development in the nearly 10-year war against terrorism waged by the United States and its allies.

You had to feel for him. As those of us in his boomer generation know -- especially those of us who have raised teenagers -- it's no longer easy for a father to lay down the law (if it ever was). George W. Bush had to do exactly that with Osama bin Laden, but with his fellow citizens he had to be more Oprahfied -- or, as we might say now, more Rudied. Bush struggled mightily at first to find the balance. And so arrived this very strange sentence delivered to the nation from the Oval Office: 'I'm a loving guy, and I am also someone, however, who's got a job to do.' In other words, he was at once a dad who hugs the kids -- as he would subsequently instruct the nation to do in his take-charge address to Congress -- and Gary Cooper at high noon. Then he welled up with tears -- as Dan Rather would, to overflowing, in his comparable updating of the anchor's paternal persona on the Letterman show a few days later.","6930":"A trusted courier of Osama bin Laden\u2019s whom American spies had been hunting for years was finally located in a compound 35 miles north of the Pakistani capital, close to one of the hubs of American counterterrorism operations.\u00a0The property was so secure, so large, that American officials guessed it was built to hide someone far more important than a mere courier.","6931":"The United States government warned American expatriates and travelers abroad early Monday of possible reprisals against them over the killing of Osama bin Laden, who was shot to death in a firefight with American forces in Pakistan on Sunday.","6932":"An earlier version of this interactive incorrectly stated the location of the airplane crash that took the life of Osama bin Laden\u2019s father.

It has been nine years and seven months since Osama orchestrated 9/11, but an American team finally killed him. His body is in American hands.

The magazine exhaustively covered 9/11 and the wars that followed \u2014 the wars, especially, with in-depth reports from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as coverage of policy debates in Washington and leading trends in South Asia and what the State Department calls MENA (Middle East/North Africa). But Bin Laden only occasionally wafted into view. In the first few months after 9/11, he was omnipresent \u2014 Andrew Sullivan, for example, filed an article late that month that talked about how it was a mistake to deny that the conflict we were in was \u201cabout religion.\u201d His main evidence was the statements of Osama bin laden, which were then forthcoming in abundance.","6984":"By midday the headline on Al Jazeera\u2019s English-language Web site read \u201cOsama bin Laden killed by US forces\u201d and all 10 of the most-viewed headlines on the Web site were about the killing of Bin Laden.

Bush ad-libbed that 'this crusade, this war on terrorism, is going to take a while,' his figure of speech was widely criticized. That's because the word has a religious root, meaning 'taking the cross,' and was coined in the 11th century to describe the first military expedition of the Crusaders, European Christians sent to recover the Holy Land from the followers of Muhammad.

Nothing on U.S. television yet, which also suggests it\u2019s not legit. Another widely seen fake, which was apparently a mashup of Bin Laden and \u201cBlack Hawk Down,\u201d appeared on Liveleak under the comment: \u201cHere is the devil \u2014 dead \u2026\u201d More cautiously, the photo caption said, \u201cLiveleak cannot confirm the authenticity of this Osama bin Laden dead picture.\u201d And a retraction has since been issued. A photograph posted by StevenBayShore on Twitpic purports to be authentic. \u201cHere\u2019s the real photo of bin Laden dead,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI swear I did not Photoshop this.\u201d But certain telltale signs raise suspicions: for instance, the absence of Bin Laden\u2019s shadow on the wall behind him, given the light source. Actual photographs would, of course, have an incendiary effect, particularly if they are as gruesome as they are believed to be. They will not dissuade conspiracy theorists but they will inflame Bin Laden supporters and sympathizers. It doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to expect more fakes in the near future. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, \u201cwe await the real thing.\u201d","712":"Those officials also identified several Pakistani air bases near the 1,400-mile border with Afghanistan that have been earmarked for use in American military operations against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government of Afghanistan.","7120":"That\u2019s one line from the already legendary Twitter stream of Sohaib Athar, an information-technology consultant and cafe owner who moved to Abbottabad, Pakistan, to get away from the madness of Lahore, only to find himself a confused, frightened, witty, half-suspecting witness to the successful raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s house.","7122":"David Brooks: Gail, I think it was Karl Marx who said that all great events happen twice, first as the event and then as the packaging.

I read somewhere that the fact that President Obama was wearing golf shoes in the Oval Office the day of the strike was a tip-off to some that something big was about to happen. Normally, the president returns to his residence after hitting the links and changes into work clothes, but that day he went straight to work. So our lesson for the day is this: If you see President Obama strolling around in his golf shoes, run like heck.","7129":"The poll\u2019s respondents had also been interviewed in a separate poll conducted April 28 to May 1 by CBS News, before President Obama\u2019s announcement of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death.","713":"It was the only truly political moment in a show that started with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani offering a serious, forward-looking tribute to New York, and went on to do safe satires of pop culture.

One reaction, however, was both cynical and disturbing: crowing by the apologists and practitioners of torture that Bin Laden\u2019s death vindicated their immoral and illegal behavior after the Sept. 11 attacks.","7141":"WASHINGTON \u2014 There were 79 people on the assault team that killed Osama bin Laden, but in the end, the success of the mission turned on some two dozen men who landed inside the Qaeda leader\u2019s compound, made their way to his bedroom and shot him at close range \u2014 all while knowing that the president of the United States was keeping watch from Washington.","7142":"An obituary\u00a0on Monday about Osama bin Laden misstated in some copies the chronology in which\u00a0Bin Laden\u2019s father was hired to renovate a number of Islamic holy sites.

There is still a risk that a photo will be leaked, they say, noting that fakes are already circulating on the Internet.

Of late, the White House says it will not give out any more operational details. But they owe us a complete story, an honest story, one for the record. After debriefing the Navy Seals, the White House should give as full an account as they can without compromising future missions. By any measure, the raid showed audacity, courage, luck \u2014 and ended in justice being served.

That stumped the former New Mexico governor for a while. But he eventually got there, after being reminded that he had run 30 marathons. Not only that, Mr. Johnson said, he has also climbed Mount Everest, and wanted to climb the tallest mountains on each of the continents. \u201cThat would be it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.

Asked if he worried about the impact of a national default, he said: \u201cThey have money coming in. They can patch it over and pay it.\u201d Mr. Cain proposed abolishing the income tax and replacing it with a 23 percent national sales tax. Told that experts say that would amount to a tax increase for the middle class, Mr. Cain said, \u201cYour experts are dead wrong.\u201d And talk about a potentially unpopular proposal: Mr. Johnson said federal Medicare and Medicaid spending should each be cut almost in half, with states told they should figure out how to pay for those programs themselves. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this we are going to find ourselves bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.

Secret military prisons. Torture. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. President Obama was not at the first Republican debate on Thursday night in South Carolina \u2014 obviously. But he set the tone from the first minutes of the debate anyway. His announcement that American commandos had killed Osama bin Laden turned what would surely have been a debate that opened on economic policy into a discussion about national security. Mr. Pawlenty offered Mr. Obama praise for the raid that killed Bin Laden, but also asserted, \u201cThat moment is not the sum total of America\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d And Mr. Santorum went further, saying that when Mr. Obama strayed from policies already in place under George W. Bush, he had \u201cgotten it wrong strategically every single time.\u201d Meanwhile, Mr. Paul contended that the pursuit of Bin Laden had nothing to do with the war in Afghanistan and said America should \u201cget the troops out\u201d now. The first 15 minutes of the debate, held at the Peace Center for the Performing Arts in Greenville, were focused entirely on national security and foreign policy.

The Lede will provide updates. 3:47 P.M.Interior Footage of Bin Laden\u2019s Compound Earlier today, Al Jazeera posted new footage on its Web site that shows the inside of Bin Laden\u2019s Abbottabad compound, recorded some time after the raid \u2014 it was not immediately clear exactly when it was shot. Al Jazeera\u2019s correspondent, Imtiaz Tyab, said that the video had been obtained from a Pakistani security official. \u201cSome of the shots show some blood, but really what this video gives us a sense of is what this compound was like,\u201d Mr. Tyab said in his report. \u201cYou see a garden, you see where they grew vegetables, you see where they kept animals, giving you a really clear sense of how they could be relatively self-sustainable, those that lived in this house.\u201d 2:12 P.M.Video of Bin Laden Watching Himself on TV Here, from The Associated Press, is video of what United States officials say is Osama bin Laden watching news coverage of himself, which was seized from his compound in Pakistan during Monday\u2019s raid: At two points during the footage released by the United States government on Saturday, Bin Laden appeared to click away immediately when the news broadcasts he was watching showed footage of President Obama. \u2013 Robert Mackey 2:04 P.M.One Account of the Videos MSNBC has its own breakdown of Bin Laden videos. The first is a message to the American people recorded in the fall of 2010. Bin Laden, his beard dyed black, is wearing a gold robe and standing in front of a blue background. He appears to be reading from a script. As with all of the videos, the audio was not played, but a government official said that Bin Laden was deploring capitalism and American policies. In the second video, Bin Laden is watching news coverage of himself on television. His beard is gray and he is wrapped in a blanket. MSNBC calls the third recording a \u201cpractice video.\u201d His hair is dyed black, and he is in front of a wooden background. The fourth and fifth are also practice videos. 1:17 P.M.More Details From the Videos As CNN, CBS and other outlets are beginning to show the C.I.A. videos, CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr is reporting more details released at the briefing. In one video, the leader of Al Qaeda is shown wrapped in a blanket, watching television \u2014 with gray hair and a gray beard. Ms. Starr reports that Bin Laden would dye his hair black before appearing to the world. In one video, streaming on the Web site of The Washington Post, Bin Laden is reading from a script in front of a blue background, with his beard dyed black. The audio from the videos were not played, Ms. Starr reports, and reporters were not allowed to record the briefing. They were permitted to take notes, she said, while an Obama administration official took photographs of the reporters. 12:31 P.M.Video Shows Bin Laden Watching Himself on TV The Associated Press is reporting that one of the videos shows Bin Laden watching himself on television. Here\u2019s the rest of this early report: The videos were seized by Navy SEALs after bin Laden was killed Monday. They were shown to reporters Saturday by intelligence officials. The five movies offer the first public glimpse at bin Laden\u2019s life behind the walls of his compound in suburban Pakistan. The government-selected clips also provide an opportunity for the U.S. to paint bin Laden in an unflattering light to his supporters. They video include outtakes of his propaganda films and, taken together, portray him as someone obsessed with his own image and how he is portrayed to the world.","7214":"In a video released by the U.S. Department of Defense, Osama bin Laden is seen watching himself on television.","7215":"First of five videos of Osama bin Laden released Saturday by the United States.","7216":"In the third of the Osama bin Laden videos, he is seen speaking against a black background.","722":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 30\u2014 The military is concerned about a shortage of surveillance equipment as the pursuit of Osama bin Laden is heating up, senior Pentagon officials and congressional aides said in interviews in the last few days.","7220":"A week after President Obama announced Osama bin Laden had been killed, the Sunday talk shows are still buzzing about what his death means for the United States.

If the Libyan revolution stalls or is defeated, a vindictive or resurgent Colonel Qaddafi and his regime will present the world with a greater danger than even Osama bin Laden. The faster the regime comes to an end, the better it will be for Libya and the safer it will be for the world.","7295":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Despite mounting pressure from the United States since the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, seems unlikely to respond to American demands to root out other militant leaders, according to people who have met with him in the last 10 days.","7296":"WASHINGTON \u2014 When Al Qaeda\u2019s online propaganda arm sought to rally supporters this week after the killing of Osama bin Laden, it did not hint that the network had a major terrorist plot in the works. Instead, it proposed do-it-yourself terrorism, urging militants around the world to come up with their own attacks, however modest.","7297":"The bombing was the first major terrorist attack since the American raid in Abbottabad on May 2 that killed Osama bin Laden.","7298":"Those who doubt that Osama bin Laden is dead.","7299":"Updated | 11:33 a.m. Three of Osama bin Laden\u2019s wives, who survived the American raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and are now in Pakistan\u2019s custody, were \u201chostile\u201d when they spoke to United States intelligence officials this week, American and Pakistani officials told CNN.","73":"Israeli and Palestinian security officials have arrested 23 Arabs suspected of planning a series of terror attacks to disrupt peace efforts, and said at least one suspect had links to Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist suspect. Security officials said the arrests, over three months, involved radicals with links to the Hamas and Islamic Holy War groups in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as the Al-Qaeda movement led by Mr. bin Laden.","730":"BIN LADEN CALLED MOTHER -- A foreign official said Osama bin Laden called his mother in Syria the day before the Sept. 11 attacks to tell her he could not meet her there because 'something big' was imminent.

That event helped push the overall bill to an easy bipartisan legislative victory.","7301":"There was a moment in President Obama\u2019s appearance at a fundraiser Tuesday evening in Austin, Tex., that became a topic of much discussion during the week. Peter Nicholas at The Los Angeles Times reported on that moment, at which Osama bin Laden became \u201can applause line in a presidential campaign speech\u201d:","7302":"Our Pashtun teenage blogger, Sher Bano, wrote this piece late last month on how the Cricket World Cup semi-final match between India and Pakistan really brought the country together and gave Pakistanis hope and something to cheer for. As we were getting ready to post it, the news broke that Osama bin Laden had been killed in Abbottabad. We decided not to run the piece until things calmed down. In the meantime, Sher emailed us her reactions to the killing, and they perhaps offer a window into the thinking of some young Pakistanis. This is some of what she said:","7304":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Senior police officials said Friday that a suicide attack that killed more than 80 cadets from a government paramilitary force was probably retaliation for an army offensive in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, and not for the death of Osama bin Laden, as the Pakistani Taliban claimed.","7305":"WASHINGTON \u2014 C.I.A. interrogators questioned three wives of Osama bin Laden for the first time on Thursday, 10 days after they were taken by Pakistani security forces from the compound where the Al Qaeda leader was killed, an American official confirmed on Friday.","7306":"The White House has announced that Mr. Obama plans to address the region in the wake of the upheaval \u2014 and the death of Osama bin Laden \u2014 in a speech on Thursday at the State Department. Coming a day before Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s visit, it could set the stage for further disagreements. Mr. Obama was also scheduled to meet Tuesday with King Abdullah II of Jordan.","7307":"For weeks, rabid anti-Western rhetoric has been intensifying among Libyan officials and finding a voice among the small crowds of pro-Qaddafi demonstrators who turn up wherever foreign reporters are taken by a government corps of minders and guides. While staged for television cameras, the threats seem likely to lead to heightened vigilance among Western counterterrorism officials, who are already on high alert in the wake of the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7308":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 In an unusual, and apparently heated, closed-door session of Parliament, Pakistan\u2019s spy chief issued a rousing denunciation of the United States on Friday for its raid that killed Osama bin Laden and denied that Pakistan maintained any links with militant groups, according to lawmakers.","7309":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The enormous cache of computer files taken from Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound contained a considerable quantity of pornographic videos, American officials said on Friday, adding a discordant note to the public image of the Islamist militant who long denounced the West for its lax sexual mores.","731":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 1\u2014 The Bush administration today released a list of 19 countries that have agreed to freeze the assets of Osama bin Laden and his associates. But the relatively short list of countries that had agreed to cooperate completely with the United States request showed how difficult it is to bar suspected terrorists from using the international financial system.","7310":"MIAMI \u2014 In large and midsize cities across the country, police chiefs and domestic security officials say they have drastically increased counterterrorism operations under the assumption that a \u201clone wolf\u201d or a small group of terrorists will try to strike on American soil to avenge the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7311":"Like most Americans, we have long despaired at the cynicism of Pakistan\u2019s leaders, who accept American \u201ccounterterrorist\u201d aid while also sheltering and enabling some of the worst anti-American extremists. But we never imagined that Osama bin Laden would be found hiding in plain sight, a stone\u2019s throw from Pakistan\u2019s leading military academy and an hour\u2019s drive from Islamabad. Pakistan\u2019s behavior since then has only added to the outrage.","7312":"Senior police officials in Pakistan said a suicide attack that killed more than 80 cadets from a government paramilitary force was probably a retaliation for an army offensive in tribal areas, and not for the death of Osama bin Laden, as the Pakistani Taliban had claimed.

(Daily News: \u201cROT IN HELL!\u201d) Gilbert joked onstage that Bin Laden\u2019s last words had been regret that he couldn\u2019t have lived just one day longer, to see Luca Spaghetti\u2019s memoir published. And she said her next book was going to be a novel.","7314":"The president\u2019s turn to a domestic pocketbook issue comes after two weeks of intense focus on the killing of Osama bin Laden, terrorism more broadly and the multiple crises in the Middle East.","7315":"Various reactions when we heard that Osama bin Laden had been killed. My first reaction, I don\u2019t know why, when I heard the news I said, \u201cOh, jeez, great. Now what is Oprah going to do for her last guest?\u201d","7317":"WASHINGTON \u2014 When a man stalks the world as a mass killer, it distracts from the ordinary interest we might otherwise take in the mundane details of his life. And so it was with Osama bin Laden.","7318":"As the United States presses Pakistan for answers about whether the ISI played a role in harboring Osama bin Laden, Mr. Headley is set to recount his story of the Mumbai attack in a federal courthouse in Chicago. What he discloses could deepen suspicions that Pakistani spies are connected to terrorists and could potentially worsen relations between Washington and Islamabad.","7319":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and Pakistan are veering toward a deeper clash, with Pakistan\u2019s Parliament demanding a permanent halt to all drone strikes just as the most senior American official since the killing of Osama bin Laden is to arrive with a stern message that the country has only months to show it is committed to rooting out Al Qaeda and associated groups.","732":"Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's semiapology for his disparaging remarks about Islamic civilization has apparently not satisfied his critics, especially in Arab countries. Today he will meet with the Saudi ambassador, the head of the Islamic Cultural Center in Rome and other Arab officials. The Arab League secretary general, Amr Mussa, said he had met with the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, on how to respond to what he called unacceptable accusations against Islamic culture. In a speech before the Italian Senate on Friday, Mr. Berlusconi expressed regret if his words last week had hurt Arab sensitivities. Gavino Angius, the senate leader of the opposition Democrats of the Left party, said Mr. Berlusconi's words had been stupid, had isolated Italy and were a gift to Osama bin Laden. Marina Harss (NYT)","7320":"By the time Navy Seals took out Osama bin Laden this month, Mr. Obama\u2019s war on terrorism made him look to some like George W. Bush. Yet as he soared in the polls, others forecast a repeat of the other George Bush, who enjoyed great popularity after winning the Persian Gulf war of 1991 only to crash at the ballot box a year later amid deep economic anxiety.","7321":"Three people living in Pakistan were also charged in the indictment, which was made public by Wilfredo A. Ferrer, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The F.B.I. said that the indictment grew out of a review of suspicious financial transactions and other evidence and not from an undercover sting operation. The arrests seem to be unrelated to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden a week ago.","7322":"The indictment comes at a tense moment in relations between the United States and Pakistan after Osama bin Laden was killed in a raid by the Navy Seals on May 2 in Abbottabad, Pakistan.","7323":"When he was alive, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was effectively gagged, unable to comment on what he saw as missteps of the Obama administration that he served. But as we face a crisis in Pakistan after the killing of Osama bin Laden, it\u2019s worth listening to Holbrooke\u2019s counsel \u2014 from beyond the grave.","7324":"IT wasn\u2019t long after Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing that the arguing began: did the Bush administration\u2019s torture policy produce essential intelligence that led the United States to Bin Laden\u2019s hideout in Pakistan?","7325":"Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the quest for Osama bin Laden misstated the number of interviews that reporters had with him after Sept. 11, 2001. It was at least two, conducted by journalists from Pakistan and from Al Jazeera in the two months after the attacks; it was not the case that no reporters interviewed Bin Laden after the attacks.","7326":"WASHINGTON -- When a man stalks the world as a mass killer, it distracts from the ordinary interest we might otherwise take in the mundane details of his life. And so it was with Osama bin Laden.","7327":"7 P.M. (CBS) 60 MINUTES Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates gives his first interview since American forces killed Osama bin Laden. Also, Katie Couric joins Mr. Gates on a five-day mission to the Middle East.","7328":"On the news itself, Le Monde noted that the arrest of DSK, as Mr. Strauss-Kahn is known in France, first seeped out at 4:59 p.m. Eastern time \u2014 reported not by journalists but in a seemingly offhanded way, like the raid on Osama bin Laden. \u201cThe raid against Bin Laden was tweeted as it was taking place.

He cited a message by Jonathan Pinet (@j_pinet), a student at France\u2019s elite university Sciences Po, who had credited a friend with the global scoop:","7329":"On Thursday, a fairly straightforward Reuters article about a NATO attack on Col.

After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush gave Mr. O'Neill the high-profile duty of tracking down the financial assets of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network.","7330":"KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Osama bin Laden\u2019s death will allow \u201ca new phase\u201d in the United States\u2019 relationship with Afghanistan, one that could include reductions in troops and spending, Senator John Kerry said while visiting here on Sunday.","7331":"THE revelation that Osama bin Laden was living less than a mile from Pakistan\u2019s national military academy has raised serious questions about the efficacy of Pakistan\u2019s military and intelligence services and brought into sharp focus the weakness of the Pakistani state.","7332":"By the time the news network was confirming the reports of the death of Osama bin Laden, however, Mr. Lemon had been replaced by CNN\u2019s chief anchor, Wolf Blitzer.","7333":"SKYPE COSTS MORE THAN YOU THINK TechCrunch\u2019s Steve O\u2019Hear says Microsoft overpaid by about $4.5 billion. Others see a bubble. Hey, at least Osama bin Laden make a shrewd investment.","7334":"1. As he nears the end of his career at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Sunday that the hardest thing he has dealt with \u201cis leading a department that is organized to plan for war but not to fight a war. And so everything that I\u2019ve wanted to do to try and help the men and women in the field I\u2019ve had to do outside the normal Pentagon bureaucracy. And I\u2019ve had to be directly involved on a week-to-week basis to make sure that it got done.

The risk to the lives of the Americans involved. It was a very gutsy call.\u201d","7335":"Police officials said they were investigating motives and did not rule out the possibility that the killing might have been retribution for the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden by Navy Seal commandos in the military garrison town of Abbottabad, a few hours\u2019 drive from Islamabad, the capital.","7336":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Senator John Kerry tried Monday to lower the temperature in the fraught relationship between the United States and Pakistan, even as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton postponed an expected visit amid the anti-American clamor by the Pakistani government over the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","7337":"That the media is ready to add weight to anything attached to Cannes was evident at another DreamWorks spectacle, a news conference last week for \u201cKung Fu Panda 2.\u201d In response to a question about the existential problems of pandas, Jack Black went on a stream-of-consciousness riff \u2014 \u201cThose weak moments, while gnawing on a bamboo shoot, do they think: \u2018What is life all about?

Not content with the president\u2019s wide-ranging powers to pursue the archcriminals of Sept. 11, 2001, Republicans want to authorize the military to pursue virtually anyone suspected of terrorism, anywhere on earth, from now to the end of time.","7339":"On Monday morning, May 2, readers of The New York Times \u2014 and newspapers around the country \u2014 could pick up the latest editions to see the face of President Obama staring back at them from Page 1 with that quiet but steely resolve that had been evident the night before. It seemed a fitting record of his announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed by American forces.","734":"Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about the possibility that the United States was using Special Forces and intelligence operatives to track down Osama bin Laden and the Taliban forces harboring him in Afghanistan misstated the name of a British force that some officials said might be involved in the search. It is the Special Air Service, not the Strategic Air Service.","7340":"In a radio interview, Mr. Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania and a Republican presidential candidate, disputed Mr. McCain\u2019s contention that \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques like waterboarding did not lead to the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7341":"\u201cLust, Devotion, &amp; the Binary Code\u201d by Kamin Mohammadi, in The Virginia Quarterly Review.

But last year, while we were watching a documentary about presidential photographers, those familiar scenes from the twin towers flashed onto the screen. My kids watched in horror and turned to me for an explanation. They didn\u2019t ask questions, they just looked at me, expecting Mommy to have the answers.

Even in an election that mostly comes down to the economy \u2014 President Obama and the Democrats, make no mistake, remain extremely vulnerable there \u2014 these could be important factors at the margins. Pick up an extra 1 percent of the vote here, an extra 2 percent of the vote there, and your strategy starts to look a lot more robust: maybe O.K.-but-not-good economic growth is enough to get the Democrats elected, in addition to good-but-not-great growth.","7391":"Photojournalists were present \u2014 but caught off guard \u2014 late on May 1, when they were summoned to the East Room for the president\u2019s broadcast announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed.

In 2001, Osama bin Laden attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Just a few months later, in 2002, the U.N. issued the \u201cArab Human Development Report,\u201d which described the very pathologies that produced Al Qaeda and prescribed remedies for overcoming them. The report, written by Arab experts, said the Arab states suffered from three huge deficits: a deficit of freedom and respect for human rights as the bases of good governance, a deficit of knowledge in the form of decent schooling and a deficit of women\u2019s empowerment.","7417":"The White House press office has confirmed the new arrangement and added details on the frequency of televised addresses. In the future, a designated news photographer \u2014 using a heavily muffled camera \u2014 will be present in the room to record televised presidential addresses like President Obama\u2019s announcement on May 1 that Osama bin Laden had been killed. Although official presidential photographers are allowed to cover broadcasts (two were present for the Bin Laden announcement), the White House has kept photojournalists at bay, arguing that their single-lens reflex cameras would make too much noise and that their jostling would be a distraction. Presidents have typically accommodated still photographers by lingering for a moment after televised speeches, either staying quiet, ad libbing or rereading a short part of the address, as Mr. Obama did on May 1. The new arrangement will end such restagings. It was worked out between the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and the White House press office late last month and reported Tuesday in The Washington Post. A more detailed account was published Wednesday by News Photographer magazine. Joshua R. Earnest, a special assistant to the president and the principal deputy press secretary, confirmed the new arrangement in an e-mail to Lens, as did Doug Mills, the secretary-treasurer of the correspondents\u2019 association who is a staff photographer at The New York Times. Controversy followed the Bin Laden announcement after it became widely understood that Mr. Obama had returned to the lectern to pose for news photographers \u2014 who were barred from the real speech \u2014 as if he were making the announcement. The Times used a photo of this re-enactment on Page 1, as did other newspapers. (\u201cWhose Eye? What Beholder?\u201d Lens, May 25.) In response to a flurry of criticism, the White House quickly ruled out future re-enactments (\u201cWhite House Stops Post-Speech Photo Ops,\u201d Lens, May 17). But it wasn\u2019t clear at first whether the long-term official answer would be to ban news organizations altogether. So it was that Mr. Mills, of The Times, could express pleasure on Wednesday about the outcome. \u201cWe get a live still during the actual event \u2014 something we\u2019ve never had before,\u201d Mr. Mills said. Mr. Earnest said he could recall only four instances during the Obama administration in which the president has made televised addresses from the White House: to discuss the end of combat in Iraq, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the aversion of a government shutdown and the death of Bin Laden. \u201cCan\u2019t predict the future,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut it is not a common occurrence.\u201d The next time it does happen, the designated photographer will be drawn from what is called the \u201ctight pool\u201d: the group that not only covers, but also travels with, the president aboard Air Force One. The pool position will be assigned in rotation to one of four news organizations \u2014 The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters and The New York Times; in that order. The pool photographer will use a sound-deadening device like the Camera Muzzle or the Sound Blimp. After editing the take, the photographer will send the images to a common Web site from which all the news organizations can draw simultaneously. Asked whether any photos would be transmitted at the very beginning of the speech, to satisfy the online demand for instant imagery, Mr. Mills said that possibility was being explored. Speaking generally of the new arrangement, he said, \u201cIt works for everyone.\u201d \u201cHaving one photographer in the pool takes away the competitive nature of photographers to bump around to get the best angle,\u201d Mr. Mills said. \u201cThese events are live on TV \u2014 millions of viewers. The last thing we would want is to have photographers bumping into the TV camera during the event. Or dropping a lens.\u201d","7418":"\u201cThe attack is to take revenge for Osama bin Laden,\u201d said Jawahir Ali, a junior police official in Barawal, referring to the American raid last month in which the leader of Al Qaeda was killed. \u201cThe militants held a meeting across the border in Afghanistan and vowed to take revenge from Pakistani government officials,\u201d Mr. Ali said.","7419":"Whatever the case, the attack humiliated the ISI and the armed services. They were already fending off allegations that they sheltered Osama bin Laden and criticism for failing to stop the American raid that killed him.","742":"BIN LADEN CALLED MOTHER -- A foreign official said Osama bin Laden called his mother in Syria the day before the Sept. 11 attacks to tell her he could not meet her there because 'something big' was imminent.

Before he could expand on the idea, prosecutors objected.","7421":"In 2012, things like President Obama\u2019s unpopular health care bill, the Republicans\u2019 unpopular Medicare bill, and the death of Osama bin Laden are likely to matter. So will the economy (those numbers are getting worse for Mr. Obama).","7422":"The video echoed a message from the terrorist network after the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 2, which similarly urged individual jihadists not to wait for instructions but to attack whenever and wherever they can.","7424":"Humans live along a continuum from doubt to faith. Wander far enough in the direction of faith and you reach the land of Nostradamus and of the Rapture (recently postponed). Wander too far in the other direction, past cynicism, through misanthropy, and you get to more or less the same zone of credulity: Osama bin Laden isn\u2019t dead, President Obama isn\u2019t American, global warming is a hoax.","7425":"Richard North Patterson would probably admit he does not hope his latest \u201centertainment,\u201d as Greene would have called it, is prescient in the least. It tells the tale of Al Qaeda\u2019s plan to set off a nuclear bomb on Sept. 11, 2011. Indeed, all that stands between a solemn anniversary and Osama bin Laden\u2019s evil designs are Brooke Chandler, a patriotic C.I.A. agent, and his mentor, Carter Grey, now retired. The plot sends Chandler to the Middle East, and the narrative alternates between Chandler\u2019s attempts to uncover the bomb\u2019s location, and the workings of Al Qaeda, specifically a dastardly operative taking orders from Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. (Bin Laden\u2019s appearance in \u201cwestern\u201d Pakistan in the prologue might date the book a bit, but Patterson\u2019s portrayal of the terrorist leader directing plots and speaking portentously is in keeping with the discoveries following his death in Abbottabad last month.)","7426":"And now we have evidence that 54-year-old Osama bin Laden had what has been referred to as an \u201cherbal version of Viagra\u201d in his medicine chest at the compound where he was hiding out with multiple wives.","7427":"Mr. Gates said at a news conference that it was too early to assess whether the Taliban would come to the negotiating table and disavow ties to Al Qaeda after the death of Osama bin Laden, the terrorist organization\u2019s founder, who had personal connections to some top insurgent leaders.","7428":"Mr. Kashmiri\u2019s death would certainly be welcomed by both American and Pakistani intelligence agencies, and could go some way to alleviating the strained relations between the two countries that have developed in recent months, in particular since the May 2 raid that killed Osama bin Laden 75 miles from Islamabad. Pakistan has accused the United States of pursuing its own agenda in Pakistan without coordinating with Pakistani security forces, running its own intelligence agents and conducting unilateral strikes that ride roughshod over Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty.","7429":"Within days of the American raid deep inside Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, Pakistani officials travelled to Beijing and asked their \u201cChinese brothers\u201d to operate a strategic port on the Arabian Sea. They also said the two countries were planning oil pipelines, railroads and even military bases in Pakistan for the Chinese Navy.","743":"Dr. Kushner, 59, is a devout profiler of terrorist types and identified Osama bin Laden as a genuine threat years ago.

Some officials say those new considerations favor steeper and faster troop reductions than the gradual approach favored by the outgoing secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, and top military commanders in the field. Mr. Obama is scheduled to discuss Afghanistan when he meets with his national security team at 10 a.m. Monday in the Situation Room.","7436":"Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings are relatively strong given the sour mood of the country. An average of current polls has them at about 50 percent and although they may be somewhat inflated because of the killing of Osama bin Laden, even at their nadir they were not much lower than 45 percent. (Although this could easily change, for the time being Mr. Obama remains the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to have never seen his Gallup approval rating drop below 40 percent.)","7437":"Still, a majority of Americans still say the war is not worth fighting, despite the killing last month of Osama bin Laden by United States forces in Pakistan, the Post said.","7438":"During their years in power in Afghanistan, from 1995 to 2001, the Taliban provided training camps for Al Qaeda and a refuge for Osama bin Laden, and since then have often acted in concert with the extremists in Afghanistan \u2014 although Al Qaeda has not been a major factor in the Afghan fighting.","7439":"The case against Mr. Rana has been watched around the world, mostly for what Mr. Headley had to say. His testimony included accusations that Pakistani intelligence agents provided support for the Mumbai attacks, threatening to exacerbate tensions among Pakistan, India and the United States that were already inflamed by the discovery that Osama bin Laden had been hiding out in a Pakistani garrison town for years.","744":"The council would be ready to step in if the Taliban is forced out, they said. Both the former king and the opposition commanders made clear that they believe that their plan is a way not just to rid their country of the Taliban, but to avoid American reprisals against Afghanistan, where the terror suspect Osama bin Laden is under Taliban protection.","7441":"The semiautonomous tribal region of North Waziristan is a redoubt of elements of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. American officials have for long urged Pakistan to begin an operation in the region and renewed such calls after May 2, when Osama bin Laden was found and killed by American forces in a night raid in Abbottabad, a garrison town in the country\u2019s northwestern province.","7442":"Ayman al-Zawahri, long the second in command of Al Qaeda, delivered his first public comments on the killing of his boss Osama bin Laden in an American raid last month, saying in a video eulogy posted by Al Qaeda\u2019s media arm on Wednesday that Bin Laden had \u201cterrified America in his life\u201d and \u201cwill continue to terrify it after his death.\u201d","7443":"Mr. Obama\u2019s approval numbers, which had been boosted for a time by the killing of Osama bin Laden, have crashed back to where they were before the military action \u2014 hovering just under 50 percent.","7444":"1:06 P.M.Really Done Now. Thanks for Reading Ok. We\u2019re really done now. Mr. Levin has just announced that the committee will break until 2:30, when they will reconvene in a classified, closed-door session. Since The Caucus is not invited to such sessions, we will end our live blog here. But do come back to the Times website for coverage of Mr. Panetta\u2019s confirmation process in the days ahead. 1:03 P.M.A Good (And Funny) Summary of the Hearing Lot\u2019s of questions and answers today. But Matt Apuzzo, an investigative reporter for the Associated Press, had a funny way of summing it up on Twitter. Here\u2019s his Tweet: \u201cSo what makes you qualified to be SecDef? Well. I\u2019m glad you asked. My resume is attached. Also, I killed Osama bin Laden. Are we done here?\u201d 12:57 P.M.What About Iraq? A Request for a Longer Presence What about Iraq? There has been a lot of discussion of Afghanistan today. But Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, asked about the proposed end of the American mission in Iraq, due to end at the end of this year. Mr. Panetta noted that the American mission is \u201con track\u201d to end, but he seemed to go out of his way to suggest that might not be the end of it. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Iraq is considering the possibility of making a request for some kind of a presence there\u201d beyond the end of 2011, Mr. Panetta said. \u201cI have every confidence that a request like that is something that will, i think, be forthcoming at some point.\u201d 12:47 P.M.Boots on the Ground in Libya? Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, made sure he put the question clearly to Mr. Panetta: Will the United States be putting any ground forces into Libya at any time. Mr. Panetta was pretty clear in response: \u201cAs far as I know, no one is discussing any boots on the ground \u2014 At any time.\u201d 12:34 P.M.What About Libya? One exchange that I missed from earlier: Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, looked over the horizon to a day when the NATO air campaign against the regime in Libya drives Colonel Muammar Qaddafi from power. \u201cWe do not have a plan in place after we have deposed a tyrant and chaos and violence ensue,\u201d she said. Mr. Panetta said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been working with the Europeans and they in turn with the opposition \u201cso that if they do in fact have to take control of the country that they have that capability.\u201d He called it a \u201clegitimate concern\u201d and said there is \u201ca lot more work to do\u201d to provide for a stable country once the military objective is achieved. 12:34 P.M.From One Former Budget Director to Another What does one former budget director ask another former budget director? Why, about the budget, what else? Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, told Mr. Panetta he is very concerned about cost overruns in the large Pentagon projects. \u201cThis would be one of my major concerns,\u201d he said. Mr. Panetta responded that \u201ca lot of bad habits\u201d had developed at the Pentagon. \u201cI think what we have got to do is make clear that those who are involved \u2026 that they have got a responsibility here to work with us, to develop better competition.\u201d He added: \u201cThe work that they are doing is not just money in their pocket. The work they are doing is important to national security.\u201d \u201cI know that this is tough,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m absolutely convinced that there\u2019s got to be a way to achieve greater cost savings.\u201d 12:27 P.M.Smoking in the Military? An interesting question from Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut: \u201cWhat about smoking in the military?\u201d This might be one that soldiers and other members of the military are interested in. Mr. Blumenthal said the effects of smoking cost the military $5 billion a year or more. But Mr. Panetta was careful not to even suggest that he might support taking away cigarettes from the nation\u2019s fighters. Instead, he focused on the question of reducing health care costs. \u201cOne of the areas i have to focus on is the health costs that are impacting here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area that you\u2019ve just defined is one area that we do have to pay attention to.\u201d 12:21 P.M.Spoke Too Soon. Hearing Resuming Again Oops. I spoke too soon. The hearing has resumed. Stay tuned for a few more updates as they wind down toward the lunch break. 12:17 P.M.Hearing is Over Now The hearing has broken up for the morning. Thanks for following along with The Caucus. Keep coming back to the Times Web site for more updates on the hearing and Mr. Panetta\u2019s confirmation process. 11:58 A.M.Another Peace Dividend? Not in 2012 The first tough-ish question comes from Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. He noted that Mr. Panetta was budget director for President Clinton in 1994, when there were deep defense cuts. \u201cExplain your role in those cuts, and whether you think they were deeper than they should have been,\u201d Mr. Cornyn asked. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t try to cash the peace dividend in 2012 while we are engaged in two wars.\u201d Mr. Panetta said that his role as budget director was to provide to the Defense Department how much money they needed to cut. \u201cLooking at it in hindsight, it might not have been the best way to achieve those savings, but it was a decision that was made at the Defense Department,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. He also noted, in a side comment, that it was those reductions, along with other actions, that helped the Clinton administration reach a balanced budget. 11:52 A.M.Pop Quizzes in Panetta\u2019s Future, McCaskill Says Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, promised Mr. Panetta that she would provide him some \u201cpop quizzes\u201d if he is confirmed. On what subject? The actions of the Wartime Contracting Commission, a panel that Ms. McCaskill helped create to keep watch on the Pentagon\u2019s spending practices. \u201cIf I\u2019m confirmed, I really do want to work with you closely with regard to the contracting issues,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. No quiz questions at Thursday\u2019s hearing though. 11:44 A.M.Graham: \u201cI Can\u2019t Wait to Vote for You.\u201d There\u2019s no one who makes questioning more entertaining than Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. And this hearing is no exception. \u201cThe president has put together an A+ national security team, and you are part of that,\u201d Mr. Graham started. \u201cNow some hard questions.\u201d That made Mr. Panetta, and the rest of the room, chuckle. And in truth, Mr. Graham\u2019s questions were not that tough. \u201cWhat happens if we lose in Afghanistan?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe not only create another safe haven for Al Qaeda and their militant allies, but the world becomes a much more threatened place because of that loss, particularly in that region,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. Mr. Graham then asked what he says to a South Carolina family who has a son or daughter in Afghanistan who was killed or injured by an explosive device made in Pakistan. \u201cI think that is one of those situations that is frustrating and angering, one where I think we have got to say to that family that we are not just walking away from that responsibility but we are continuing to put pressure on those countries,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. Mr. Graham agreed, and quipped, \u201cPakistan needs to get with the program.\u201d Mr. Graham then asked what happens if the leader in Libya, Muammer el-Qaddafi, stays in power after the United States has said he has to go. \u201cI think it sends a terrible signal to these other countries,\u201d Mr. Panetta responded. \u201cI think it tells them that our word isn\u2019t worth very much if we\u2019re not willing to stick with it. Mr. Graham liked that answer: \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more. I can\u2019t wait to vote for you.\u201d So much for the tough questions. 11:29 A.M.Criteria for Measuring Progress in Afghanistan? Interesting question from Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska: How do we measure success in Afghanistan \u201cso that we are not in a gray area always about whether we are winning or losing or making progress?\u201d Mr. Panetta offered several criteria: 1. Levels of violence. 2. District assessments. 3. Evaluation of the development of the Afghan Army, police operation. 4. Governance responsibilities. \u201cThose are all key areas that I think need to be evaluated,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. 11:19 A.M.A Budget Question: $400 Billion in Cuts? Here\u2019s a budget question, from Senator Kelly Ayote, Republican of New Hampshire: Do you agree with the proposed $400 billion cuts to the Defense Department over the next 10 years? \u201cI agree with the commitment of the president to try to take action to reduce the deficit,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. But, he added, \u201cI do want to say there is a comprehensive review that is going on \u2026 that comprehensive review is looking at a number of issues.\u201d He continued, \u201cIf there was something that indicated from the comprehensive review that our military would be adversely impacted, I would share it with the president.\u201d 11:15 A.M.Not All Hearings Are So Easy. Remember John Tower? Lot\u2019s of praise from both sides of the aisle for Mr. Panetta, whose long service in government and on Capitol Hill has made him plenty of friends. (And the successful raid that killed Osama bin Laden recently didn\u2019t hurt, either.) But it\u2019s interesting to remember that not all nominations go as smoothly. This reporter remembers the first confirmation hearing he ever attended \u2014 Senator John Tower\u2019s nomination to be secretary of defense in 1989. That confirmation became extremely contentious, lasted five weeks and ended with Mr. Tower being defeated in the committee. Here\u2019s a link to the Times story about that vote in February of 1989. What a difference. 11:08 A.M.What\u2019s the Afghanistan Mission? Interesting question from one of the newest senators, Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts: \u201cWhat is the mission in Afghanistan?\u201d The answer: \u201cThe fundamental mission in Afghanistan is to provide sufficient stability so that country never again becomes a haven for Al Qaeda.\u201d It\u2019s obviously more complicated than that, he said, listing efforts to weaken the Taliban, build up the country\u2019s own force structure, and develop \u201cthe governance system.\u201d But at the end of the day, he said, that\u2019s the answer. 11:00 A.M.The Next Pearl Harbor? Cyber Attacks Mr. Panetta was just asked about cyber warfare. His answer was interesting. \u201cThe next Pearl Harbor that we face could well be a cyber attack,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cThis is a real possibility in today\u2019s world.\u201d Mr. Panetta cited concerns about electronic attacks on the nation\u2019s electrical grid, the infrastructure and the communications networks. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take both defensive measures as well as aggressive measures to deal with it,\u201d he said. 10:58 A.M.Afghanistan Needs Include the Non-Military Lawmakers are asking Mr. Panetta about the report released this week that suggests that nonmilitary efforts in Afghanistan are struggling. \u201cI know that the Department of Defense is our primary military weapon in terms of securing areas,\u201d Mr. Panetta said in response to a question by Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t follow it up with these other important assets, we will never be able to secure these countries.\u201d 10:47 A.M.A Conditions-Based Withdrawal Another question on the Afghanistan withdrawal, this time from Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia. Mr. Chambliss said he thought a withdrawal \u201cat this time makes no sense. It may make sense from a domestic political perspective.\u201d He added, \u201cI am concerned that a significant withdrawal of U.S. forces will reverse the progress that we have made.\u201d Mr. Chambliss asked if Mr. Panetta would recommend to the president to halt a withdrawal if it looked like the progress was being reversed. \u201cThis has to be a conditions based withdrawal,\u201d Mr. Panetta responded. If it looked like a withdrawal was hurting the mission, he said, \u201cobviously the president and the secretary would have to make a judgement.\u201d 10:33 A.M.A Non-Answer on Afghanistan Withdrawal Mr. Panetta had an interesting exchange with Mr. McCain over the issue of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Mr. McCain asked whether he agreed with Mr. Gates that a withdrawal this summer should be \u201cmodest.\u201d The answer appeared not to satisfy. \u201cI agree that they should be conditions based,\u201d Mr. Panetta said, adding that he would leave it to Mr. Gates and the president to decide. You\u2019re going to be defense secretary, Mr. McCain said. \u201cIf I\u2019m confirmed, I\u2019ll have to obviously arrive at a decision myself,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cI\u2019m not in that position now. Obviously, i have tremendous admiration for Secretary Gates. But with regards to specific numbers\u2026\u201d A miffed Mr. McCain cut him off: \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for specific numbers.\u201d Look for similar exchanges throughout the morning as lawmakers seek to pin Mr. Panetta down on the size of any withdrawal this summer. And look for Mr. Panetta to keep dodging the question as Mr. Obama and his advisers meet privately in the coming weeks to determine the answer to that question. 10:19 A.M.Pakistan Relationship \u201cComplicated and Frustrating\u201d Prompted by a question from Mr. Levin, Mr. Panetta calls the United States\u2019s relationship with Pakistan \u201cone of the most critical and yet one of the most complicated and frustrating relationships that we have.\u201d But he adds: \u201cWe have to maintain the relationship.\u201d 10:08 A.M.Praise for the Man Not in the Room: Robert Gates Mr. Panetta is giving his opening statement. First up: hailing his soon-to-be predecessor, Robert M. Gates. Mr. Panetta said that \u201cI, too, believe that he will be remembered as one of the greatest secretaries of defense in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Mr. Gates may not be in the room, but his presence is certainly felt. Already, he has been called \u201can outstanding\u201d secretary of defense by Ms. Feinstein and was described by Mr. McCain as \u201cthe finest, most effective, most impactful secretary of defense\u201d in the nation\u2019s history. Expect more praise for Mr. Gates as the hearing continues. 9:56 A.M.Introductions from California\u2019s Senators Mr. Panetta is being introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Barbara Boxer of California. Both have known Mr. Panetta, a former lawmaker from California. 9:52 A.M.McCain Opening Statement Senator John McCain of Arizona has offered his initial thoughts as the most senior Republican on the committee. He warned against cutting so deeply into the Pentagon\u2019s budget that the government creates a \u201chollow\u201d armed forces. But at the same time, Mr. McCain, a veteran lawmaker who is known for opposition to earmarks, said \u201cit will be important to eliminate weapons programs that are over cost and behind schedule. We must continue to eliminate every dollar of wasteful spending.\u201d Mr. McCain is generally a hawk when it comes to the use of the military abroad, and he made it clear in his opening statement that he wants some troops to remain in Iraq past this summer, and that he wants a scheduled drawdown in Afghanistan to be small. \u201cI would agree with Secretary Gates that any drawdown should be modest,\u201d Mr. McCain said. 9:42 A.M.A Warm Welcome A friendly welcome for Mr. Panetta from Senator Carl Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. But also indications that Democrats will have some tough questions about the future in Afghanistan as well as inquiries about how Mr. Panetta will deal with efforts to cut the Pentagon budget. 9:34 A.M.The Hearing Has Begun Welcome to the live blog everyone. The confirmation hearing has just started. Mr. Panetta is in the hearing room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. As the hearing began, a few protesters held pink signs saying \u201cNo More War,\u201d an indication of one of the biggest questions that Mr. Panetta will face on Thursday \u2014 how fast the United States will withdraw from Afghanistan.","7445":"This week I\u2019ve practically rescued an entire second column from the cutting-room floor of my Talk interview with Jean Sasson, who told the weird and fascinating life stories of Osama bin Laden\u2019s son and wife in her 2009 book, \u201cGrowing Up Bin Laden.\u201d Here we learn a family insider\u2019s take on Bin Laden\u2019s \u201cReal Housewives of Tora Bora\u201d-like drama, and what she imagines he was thinking in his last moments of life.","7446":"Mr. Panetta, who last month oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, told the committee that Pakistan remained a serious problem for the United States, because insurgents based in that country\u2019s northwest frontier areas were fighting the American military across the border in Afghanistan. The United States has been asking the government of Pakistan for years to flush out the insurgents, with very little success.","7447":"Friends and colleagues said Mr. Leiter\u2019s departure was expected, as his tenure coincided with one of the most demanding periods after the Sept. 11 attacks. Even as Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership in Pakistan came under increasing pressure, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, Qaeda affiliates blossomed in Yemen and North Africa, and American officials warned of a threat from homegrown terrorists here.","7448":"Mr. Headley\u2019s testimony made headlines around the world when he accused not just Mr. Rana but also Pakistani intelligence officers of helping to support the Mumbai attacks. The accusations threatened to exacerbate tensions among the United States, Pakistan and India, especially after American Special Forces discovered Osama bin Laden hiding out in a Pakistani military town.","7449":"As he prepares for the release of \u201cAlpocalypse,\u201d Mr. Yankovic was focused on more practical and less philosophical concerns: trying to keep a lid on details about his video for \u201cPerform This Way,\u201d and hoping that \u201cParty in the C.I.A.,\u201d with its references to waterboarding and targeted assassinations, won\u2019t be construed as a commentary on how Ms. Cyrus\u2019s original song became an unofficial anthem after the death of Osama bin Laden. (\u201cIt\u2019s a little eerie,\u201d Mr. Yankovic said of his parody. \u201cI hope people won\u2019t consider the song in bad taste.\u201d)","745":"Last week, Mr. Bush issued an executive order freezing the assets of people and organizations said to be linked to the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the terrorist attacks.","7451":"I saw Herzog\u2019s film just after the death of Osama bin Laden, and like everything that happened then, the movie seemed to bend around that event. The mythology of Bin Laden, of course, had much to do with caves. He was supposed to have been living in them since 2001, foiling history\u2019s most technologically advanced superpower with the most archaic tool possible: a hole in a rock. He was often portrayed as a Stone Age supervillain, plotting our destruction from the depths of his mountain lair. (It\u2019s interesting that Bin Laden did not see himself that way. In \u201cThe Bin Ladens,\u201d Steve Coll writes that he \u201cmocked his Western adversaries for misunderstanding him as a premodern fanatic, a bearded loner in a faraway cave; he saw himself, instead, as a master of global technology and change.\u201d)","7452":"The killing, after Mr. Mohammed accidentally encountered a Somali checkpoint, was a major loss for the terrorist network, still reeling from the assassination of its founder, Osama bin Laden, in Pakistan last month.","7453":"Tensions between the United States and Pakistan have worsened since the American military raid that killed Osama bin Laden near the Pakistani capital last month. American officials say they have uncovered no evidence that anyone in Pakistan\u2019s senior leadership knew about Bin Laden\u2019s hiding place, although the departing defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, said recently that he thought \u201csomebody\u201d in Pakistan knew.","7454":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 Two explosions went off minutes apart in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar on Sunday, killing at least 34 people and wounding nearly 100 in one of the deadliest attacks since the United States military raid that killed Osama bin Laden last month, officials said.","7455":"It is this mixed landscape of improvement and uncertainty that confronts President Obama and his advisers, just a month after the killing of Osama bin Laden, as they weigh how many troops to withdraw from Afghanistan this summer.","7456":"He was the third major figure in Al Qaeda killed in recent weeks, beginning with the death of Osama bin Laden in an American raid in Pakistan last month. An American drone strike killed Ilyas Kashmiri, a senior operation commander of the group, in Pakistan earlier this month.","7457":"The government also argues that, given what is now known about the witness, a former United States Army sergeant who became a Qaeda operative and a close aide to Osama bin Laden, the only way he could have provided exculpatory testimony for Mr. Nosair would have been to lie on the stand.","7458":"Like many veterans, I\u2019ve been called a hero for my military service. As I see it, I didn\u2019t accomplish anything extraordinary during my time in the Army or my two tours in Iraq. I did my job. I had good days and I had bad days. Yes, on really bad days things were nasty and might involve multiple fiery explosions or being under severely oppressive heat for hours, wearing a full kit. Despite these hardships, I tried, generally, to do as good a job as I could while serving, and I left military service honorably. Even though I didn\u2019t participate in any solitary acts of heroism, like jumping on a grenade or being the guy who got Osama bin Laden, there are many who would say I am a hero for doing what others would not while putting myself at extreme risk.","7459":"The killing of Osama bin Laden has intensified questions about the need for prolonged American involvement in fighting Al Qaeda.","746":"Months ago, Dale F. Eickelman, a professor at Dartmouth College, accepted a grant from a program at Oxford University to study the splintering religious and political leadership within the Islamic world, including the role of Osama bin Laden.","7460":"Weeks after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden at this compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan arrested C.I.A. informants who had assisted in the operation.","7461":"A piece of fiction you very much hope isn\u2019t true, this spy novel centers on a Pakistani terrorist seeking revenge against the United States. A terrorist, mind you, who has a point. Mr. Ignatius eschews your average one-note jihadi for a relatable modern man, a computer scientist who had no interest in war until an American drone\u2019s bomb obliterated his family. Mr. Ignatius, a foreign affairs columnist for The Washington Post, peers inside the Pakistani intelligence service we know from the recent coverage of Osama bin Laden. \u201cOf course, the Pakistanis were trying to help officially, just enough, but they had held something back, too,\u201d Mr. Ignatius writes. Their counterparts in the C.I.A., specifically the book\u2019s borderline-rogue unit, are suspect too. Though we can trust the young C.I.A. officer, Sophie Marx, she\u2019s a pretty cardboard heroine. The story\u2019s twists are not especially exhilarating either. But being in far-flung outposts in the tribal regions of Pakistan is fascinating.","7462":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s army chief, the most powerful man in the country, is fighting to save his position in the face of seething anger from top generals and junior officers since the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden, according to Pakistani officials and people who have met the chief in recent weeks.","7463":"The court sided with prosecutors who said that Mr. Bashir had helped mobilize and finance a militant group that set up an armed training camp in the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra. The group, which called itself Al Qaeda of the Veranda of Mecca but appeared to have no ties to the group founded by Osama bin Laden, was violently suppressed by the police last year.","7464":"WASHINGTON \u2014 American counterterrorism officials all but welcomed the announcement on Thursday that Ayman al-Zawahri would succeed Osama bin Laden as leader of Al Qaeda, arguing that his deep flaws are likely to weaken the core of the terrorist network.","7465":"Both Mr. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, deflected a question on whether they were concerned that Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who has led the Pakistani Army since 2007, might be in danger of losing his position. Pakistani officials and an American military officer said this week that General Kayani was fighting to survive in the face of anger among top generals and junior officers about the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and that a coup, while unlikely, was not out of the question.","7467":"Six weeks after Osama bin Laden\u2019s death, a federal judge in Manhattan on Friday formally dismissed a series of indictments that had remained pending against the former Qaeda leader. They were originally brought more than a decade ago.","7468":"A federal judge in Manhattan formally dismissed charges against Osama bin Laden on Friday that were originally brought more than a decade ago. A first indictment, for conspiracy to attack United States defense installations, was filed in 1998 when the authorities were considering a plan to capture and try him in New York. Later indictments charged him in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ordered the dismissals at the request of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who filed papers citing proof of Bin Laden\u2019s death. Charges remain open against other Qaeda figures, including Ayman al-Zawahri, who has succeeded Bin Laden as the group\u2019s leader.","7469":"The statement did not say where the sites were or when the raids occurred. But it is likely to further add to tensions between the United States and Pakistan, whose relations have been strained since the United States killed Osama bin Laden last month without notifying officials here ahead of time.","747":"These missions should emphasize our determination to track down Osama bin Laden and to destroy his organization and other terrorist groups; ask for the countries' cooperation in the war on terrorism; offer economic cooperation if these countries join the war on terrorism; and make clear that the United States will regard any regime that aids or harbors terrorists to be an enemy and that we will wage war against that regime with all of our military might.","7470":"The officials said the intense campaign of drone strikes and other covert operations in Pakistan \u2014 most dramatically the raid that killed Osama bin Laden \u2014 had left Al Qaeda paralyzed, with its leaders either dead or pinned down in the frontier area near Afghanistan. Of 30 prominent members of the terrorist organization in the region identified by intelligence agencies as targets, 20 have been killed in the last year and a half, they said, reducing the threat they pose.","7471":"\u201cWe have to hide, because as far as the security forces are concerned we are all terrorists,\u201d Mr. Saeb said. \u201cThey think we are like Osama bin Laden.\u201d","7472":"BEHIND THE NEWS His problem is seething anger in the ranks over the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2. Under pressure from fellow top commanders, General Kayani has become much more prickly and obstinate in dealing with Washington, officials said. He has been trying to shore up army morale and his own standing with a highly unusual series of visits to garrisons and base mess halls.","7474":"But by returning to the initial objective of that invasion, getting Osama bin Laden and hobbling Al Qaeda, the terror group he built, Mr. Obama is taking several risks. He is betting that an American force that may remain in Afghanistan for years or decades, upward of 25,000 troops if the Afghan government agrees, will prevent the country from again becoming a terrorist enclave. And he is essentially downgrading the grander vision for transforming Afghanistan, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others, have described as the ultimate firewall against Islamic extremism.","7475":"They do share some common ground. Both emphasize peace through strength. Both are skeptical of international institutions. And Paul has been at pains to express support for operations like the one that killed Osama bin Laden.","7476":"The comments, by legislators who specialize in intelligence matters and military affairs, were just the latest expression of distrust between Washington and Islamabad after a series of bruising episodes, notably the secret American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","7477":"House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, who has criticized the president\u2019s actions in Libya, has indicated his support for the mission in Afghanistan, saying several weeks ago that the Obama administration should not use the death of Osama bin Laden as an excuse for prematurely bringing the Afghanistan war to a close.","7478":"Remember how after 9/11, Osama bin Laden\u2019s attacks on us could be linked to almost anything, from shopping habits to the rediscovery of Western values to carbon-pricing schemes? \u00a0Something similar appears to be happening with Bin Laden\u2019s death. Jihadism sure isn\u2019t what it used to be. After 10 years, it seems, the time has come to go home. Troops are and will be coming back to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan. The military budget will be cut. The outgoing secretary of defense feels able to openly mock NATO because, presumably, he thinks he can afford to \u2014 because it doesn\u2019t matter all that much. The global war on terror is being downgraded from Armageddon to something more out of Leviticus: a tricked-out police action, just as John Kerry, in this magazine, always said it should be. On Sunday, Helene Cooper and Mark Landler reported that \u201cAmerican success in the counterterrorism campaign would seem to bolster arguments for a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d By Tuesday morning, they were reporting that President Obama would announce his withdrawal plans on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Harris poll revealed that 51 percent of Americans and 54 percent of Britons believed \u201cthe death of Bin Laden meant it was time to bring troops from their countries home.\u201d","7479":"News of his detention comes at a sensitive time for the army, when morale in its ranks is at a historical ebb after the May 2 night raid by United States commandos that killed Osama bin Laden, and an attack on Pakistan\u2019s largest naval base by militants who appear to have had inside assistance.","748":"Secretary Powell insisted that the administration is demonstrating to allies and moderate Arab governments that the case against Osama bin Laden and his network is convincing.","7480":"Most Pakistanis disapprove of the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden and think it will have harmful effects on relations between Pakistan and the United States, according to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. But overwhelmingly negative attitudes toward the United States did not change from the month before the raid to two weeks after, remaining at the worst levels measured in eight years.","7481":"\u201cFor over four decades, Leon Panetta has been an extraordinary public servant spanning several administrations,\u201d said Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. She added that Mr. Panetta had \u201cplayed an instrumental role in the successful mission to bring Osama bin Laden to justice.\u201d","7483":"The withdrawals would begin winding down the military\u2019s counterinsurgency strategy, which Mr. Obama adopted 18 months ago. Administration officials indicated that they now planned to place more emphasis on focused clandestine counterterrorism operations of the kind that killed Osama bin Laden, which the president cited as Exhibit A in the case for a substantial American troop reduction.","7484":"PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good evening.\u00a0 Nearly 10 years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor.\u00a0 This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security \u2013- one in which the targets were no longer soldiers on a battlefield, but innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives.","7485":"The administration argues that the killing of Osama bin Laden last month at his compound deep inside Pakistan, combined with scores of other counterterrorism strikes, have given it greater leeway to reduce its troop numbers in Afghanistan. Yet Pakistan\u2019s angry reaction to that raid also makes it more urgent than ever that the United States maintain sites outside the country to launch drone and commando raids against the militant networks that remain in Pakistan, and to make sure that Pakistan\u2019s fast-growing nuclear arsenal never falls into the wrong hands.","7486":"Mr. Obama is benefiting from a confluence of factors \u2014 a rising strain of Republican isolationism, the killing of Osama bin Laden and deep concerns about spending and the deficit \u2014 which provide unexpected flexibility for dealing with Congress and selling his decision to the nation. He will test whether the post-Sept. 11 politics have changed enough to allow a Democratic president to wind down a war with little or no political peril.","7487":"Mr. Obama would have been more persuasive if he had just flatly declared that without a base in Afghanistan, the United States would never have been able to carry out the raid that got Osama bin Laden.","7488":"Mr. Obama is benefiting from a confluence of factors -- a rising strain of Republican isolationism, the killing of Osama bin Laden and deep concerns about spending and the deficit -- which provide unexpected flexibility for dealing with Congress and selling his decision to the nation.

Nor did he watch last month when the president announced the killing of Osama bin Laden. It\u2019s not that Mr. Brennan does not approve or care.","7494":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The cellphone of Osama bin Laden\u2019s trusted courier, which was recovered in the raid that killed both men in Pakistan last month, contained contacts to a militant group that is a longtime asset of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency, senior American officials who have been briefed on the findings say.","7495":"Federal park police officers found Mr. Melaku early last Friday morning in Arlington National Cemetery after it had closed. He tried to flee but was captured along with a backpack that officials said contained spent 9-millimeter shell casings, four bags of ammonium nitrate \u2014 an ingredient used in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City \u2014 and a notebook with entries referring to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","7496":"Thank you, President Obama, for starting to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. Another promise kept. The president told us that he would end combat in Iraq (check!) and refocus on Afghanistan (check!) in order to make real progress against terrorism (check!) and get Osama bin Laden (check!) so we can start bringing troops home from Afghanistan, too (check again!).","7497":"The improbable end to a hunt that many people had long assumed had turned cold riveted his neighbors in Santa Monica, but even more so the people back in his old haunts in South Boston, where Whitey had been a legendary mobster -- a hero to some, but loathed by many -- who had helped define a Boston of old.

Potential targets in the state, the memo said, could be shopping malls, sporting events like the Major League Baseball All-Star game in July and military installations.","7499":"Mr. Biden\u2019s hand was strengthened by other factors, including chronic tensions with the government of President Karzai and the Navy Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden, which lent support to his argument that the United States could combat Al Qaeda with focused covert operations rather than a major troop deployment.","750":"BRIGHTON, England, Oct. 2\u2014 Sealing his standing as America's most passionate and steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism, Prime Minister Tony Blair declared today that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and challenged the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan to give him up or 'face the consequences.'","7501":"Mr. Grossman has participated in two meetings with senior officials from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The first, coincidentally, took place in Pakistan the day after the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.","7502":"Administration hawks, largely in the military, are uneasy; they had wanted to go slower, so as to safeguard recent gains made against the Taliban. Administration doves, largely in the White House, are disappointed; they had wanted to pull back faster, seeing the killing of Osama bin Laden as an ideal opportunity to get out.","7503":"During two hourlong sets on Saturday, Mr. Morgan did not repeat the bit that had gotten him in trouble, though his mind certainly went anywhere else that allowed him to imitate a bedroom or bathroom noise. He also made obviously facetious claims, saying he had been the assassin of Osama bin Laden, and variously describing himself as single, in a relationship, married and divorced. (He\u2019s engaged with three sons from a previous marriage.)","7504":"And still other officials say the idea of pressing for an authorization was never a priority because few at first thought the NATO-led air war would last long enough to trigger a 60-day deadline for unauthorized deployments into hostilities under the War Powers Resolution. At the same time, they said, a host of other issues were competing for attention, including the killing of Osama bin Laden and the need to strike a budget deal to avert a government shutdown.","7505":"In an interview en route to the Francis Lewis graduation on Tuesday, Mr. Walcott said the shift to actually running the school system and its 143,000 workers after nearly a decade of overseeing it as deputy mayor felt profound, even though his new office is a three-minute walk from the old one and he has the same boss. He laughingly calls himself \u201cthe wandering chancellor,\u201d and noted that the morning after Osama bin Laden was reported killed, he \u201cpopped by\u201d three downtown schools just to get a feel for what was going on.","7506":"At the same time, Americans are closely divided over Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of his job as president: 47 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove. With the exception of a short-lived jump in approval ratings after the death of Osama bin Laden, the public\u2019s evaluation of Mr. Obama\u2019s stewardship has remained steady \u2014 ranging from 44 percent to 49 percent over the past year.","7507":"Muammar Qaddafi, who, prior to Osama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people.\u00a0 And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect -- provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.\u00a0","7508":"Laying out the administration\u2019s plan to battle Al Qaeda in the era after Osama bin Laden and at a time of declining public support for costly wars, Mr. Brennan outlined a White House counterterrorism strategy that formalized a governmentwide approach that had been evolving in practice since Mr. Obama took office.","7509":"Mr. Panetta, the son of Italian immigrants who grew up in Monterey, Calif., is gregarious and casual (and a California wine aficionado). He titled his goodbye message to his C.I.A. employees \u201carrivederci\u201d and told them, in part referring to the C.I.A.-run raid that killed Osama bin Laden, \u201cWe had one hell of a ride together.\u201d His golden retriever, Bravo, joined him on the stage at his C.I.A. farewell ceremony and is expected to sit in on his meetings in the Pentagon\u2019s E ring. Unlike Mr. Gates, who was relentlessly prompt, Mr. Panetta rolled up for his first day at the Pentagon at 8:38 a.m., eight minutes later than scheduled and an eternity in military time.","751":"In Washington today, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, speaking after talks with India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said the American campaign against terrorism would focus on Kashmiri militants as well as Al Qaeda, the network of Osama bin Laden, the primary suspect in the attacks. 'We are going after terrorism in a comprehensive way, not just in the present instance of Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, but terrorism as it affects nations around the world, to include the kind of terrorism that affects India,' Secretary Powell said.","7510":"The Obama administration\u2019s increased focus on Somalia comes as the White House has unveiled a new strategy to battle Al Qaeda in the post-Osama bin Laden era, and as some American military and intelligence officials view Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Somalia as a greater threat to the United States than the group of operatives in Pakistan who have been barraged with hundreds of drone strikes directed by the Central Intelligence Agency in recent years.","7511":"2. (D) Al Qaeda. In documents captured from his Pakistani compound, Osama bin Laden complained about his terrorist organization\u2019s image, and suggested changing its name to Taifat al-Tawhed Wal-Jihad, which roughly translates to \u201cI Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Terrorism.\u201d","7512":"This modest awards proposal has lately assumed a degree of urgency. After the killing of Osama bin Laden, some \u2014 like John Yoo, the Bush Justice Department lawyer who twisted the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions to excuse the inexcusable \u2014 argued that waterboarding and other abuses were both proper and necessary.","7513":"On the morning after Osama bin Laden was killed, I woke up in my daughter\u2019s Upper West Side apartment during a pre-Mother\u2019s Day visit. I turned on the radio in the middle of a news announcement.","7514":"America and Osama bin Laden are now friends.","7515":"Others, like the former commander, have gotten out because of their disillusionment over the way they were being used to fight Osama bin Laden\u2019s war, or used for the aims of a few top generals who had allied Pakistan with the United States to gain access to its military and financial aid. \u201cThere are a lot of people who do not think they are doing the right thing,\u201d he said of the military.","7516":"But the disclosure of the information in itself could further aggravate the badly fractured relationship between the United States and Pakistan, which worsened significantly with the American commando raid two months ago that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistan safehouse and deeply embarrassed the Pakistani government, military and intelligence hierarchy. Obama administration officials will deliberate in the coming days how to present the information about Mr. Shahzad to the Pakistani government, an administration official said.","7517":"After Al Qaeda attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, we rightly sought to bring to justice those who attacked us, to eliminate Al Qaeda\u2019s safe havens and training camps in Afghanistan, and to remove the terrorist-allied Taliban government. With hard work and sacrifice, our troops, intelligence personnel and diplomatic corps have skillfully achieved these objectives, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden.","7518":"The American security official said that passengers, particularly on flights to the United States, should expect an increased security presence at airports. Security had already been raised in May after the killing of Osama bin Laden. The official would not say whether the new intelligence had come from materials obtained at Bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan.","7519":"The publication of the letter comes at a particularly inopportune moment for the Pakistani military. Already discredited inside Pakistan for its failure to detect the American commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, the military has veered from crisis to crisis since then. If authentic, the letter seems certain to rekindle questions about whether Pakistan\u2019s most respected institution played a key role in the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology.","752":"BRUSSELS, Oct. 2\u2014 NATO said today that the United States had provided 'clear and compelling proof' that Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization was behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In response, the alliance said it was ready to fight at the side of the United States should it ask for such help from its 18 NATO allies.","7520":"Admiral Mullen, who is due to retire at the end of September, is the first American official to publicly accuse Pakistan, an American ally, of the kidnapping, torture and death of the journalist, Saleem Shahzad, 40. His comments about a case that has intensified criticism of the government in Islamabad are certain to further aggravate the poisoned relationship between the United States and Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden was killed in an American raid in May.","7521":"There is evidence that they were complicit in hiding Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and that the ISI helped plan the Mumbai attack in 2008. They failed to prevent the recent attack on a naval base in Karachi. Mr. Shahzad disappeared two days after publishing an article suggesting the attack was retaliation for the navy\u2019s attempt to crack down on Al Qaeda militants in the armed forces.","7522":"They were Mr. Panetta\u2019s first public remarks in his new post and among the most positive from a senior American national security official about the decade-old war against the terrorist organization, founded by Osama bin Laden, that was responsible for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.","7523":"Some American officials say Pakistan has only itself to blame, citing the Pakistani military\u2019s decision to distance itself from American assistance in response to the humiliation suffered from the American commando raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed Osama bin Laden, as well as rising anger from midlevel Pakistani officers and the Pakistani public that senior military leaders, including Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the powerful army chief of staff, are too accommodating to the Americans.","7524":"General Petraeus said that after a period of breakdown as a result of the raid against Osama bin Laden in May, cooperation with Pakistan was resuming on dealing with militant groups along the Afghan-Pakistan border, like the feared Haqqani network.","7525":"Mr. Panetta, who had been the Central Intelligence Agency director for the last three years, said that the killing of Osama bin Laden has cleared the way for progress against the terrorist organization. \u201cHaving gotten Bin Laden, we have now identified the key leadership within Al Qaeda. If we can be successful at going after them, I think we can really undermine their ability to do any kind of planning, to be able to conduct any kind of attack on this country.\u201d He added that \u201cNow is the moment, following what happened with bin Laden, to put maximum pressure on them. If we continue this effort, that we can really cripple Al Qaeda.\u201d","7526":"WASHINGTON \u2014 In the months before Osama bin Laden was killed, the Central Intelligence Agency ran a phony vaccination program in Abbottabad, Pakistan, as a ruse to obtain DNA evidence from members of Bin Laden\u2019s family thought to be holed up in an expansive compound there, according to an American official.","7527":"I have my 9/11 relics. I don't know why I keep them; I can't say that they make me feel any better. But I keep them nevertheless, as reminders of a world-altering moment, close to where I live and work. I have a couple of crosses, one made from World Trade Center marble and given to me by a police officer, and another made from the twin towers steel and given to me by a friend who lost someone very close to him. Her name was Ann Nelson, she was from North Dakota, and well after she died, her mother discovered a to-do list on Ann's laptop: \"learn a foreign language; Kilimanjaro; never be ashamed of who I am. ...\" I have the construction helmet that I wore when I camped out near the site with the National Guard, several days after the collapse. I have a flier from the Dakota Roadhouse bar in Lower Manhattan, saying in colorful language that since Osama bin Laden has us working overtime, it's time to drink. There are other things. What relics do you have? Do you have scraps of the papers that blew all the way to Brooklyn? A photograph or two that you need to brace yourself to see again? Does your community have a memorial that incorporates something from the catastrophe? The New York Times would like to know. Please send photographs of the relics you have. Tell us, in 125 words or less, why you saved these items and what they mean to you. Some photos will appear in a special report to be published in print and online this Sept. 11.

The Afghanistan part was long in the works, but Kerry had tacked on a trip to Islamabad at the last minute in the hope of preventing the relationship with Pakistan from going over a cliff in the aftermath of the killing of Osama bin Laden. Kerry typically travels alone, save for an aide or two; I was the first journalist he had permitted to travel with him. He likes to go places where he can ask questions without being overheard. After arriving in Kabul the morning of May 14, he turned around and flew on a military transport to Camp Chapman, the C.I.A. listening post at Khost, near the Pakistan border. He was told, among other things, that Pakistani soldiers were not only letting extremists cross the border unhindered but were also themselves firing on border posts manned by American and Afghan soldiers \u2014 information he had every intention of using as ammunition in his coming discussions with the Pakistanis.","7531":"IT\u2019S starting to look likely \u2014 given news reports about her interest in fake names and disguises \u2014 that if Casey Anthony gets out of jail as scheduled this weekend, she will do her best to avoid the public eye and join the list of runaways that has recently included James (Whitey) Bulger, Ratko Mladic, Osama bin Laden and certain state senators from Wisconsin.","7532":"The allegations of a long-running plan to influence American elections and foreign policy come at a time of deep tensions between the United States and Pakistan \u2014 and in particular its spy agency \u2014 amid the fallout over the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden at a compound deep inside Pakistan on May 2.","7534":"Mr. Kucinich, who was invited by Mr. Fai to attend the Capitol Hill event last July, said the conference featured prominent academics and foreign dignitaries from India and Pakistan, so there was no reason for him to be suspicious about who might be behind it. He noted he had taken votes since then that would have eliminated some military financing for Pakistan to punish it for its apparent lack of assistance in helping the United States find Osama bin Laden \u2014 a sign that he was not a pawn of the Pakistani government.","7535":"There was ample reason for concern that terrorists might be responsible. In 2004 and again in 2008, the No. 2 leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, who took over after the death of Osama bin Laden, threatened Norway because of its support of the American-led NATO military operation in Afghanistan.","7536":"Even as the army collapsed in Zinjibar, its commanders tried one last, desperate ploy. They hired a tribal mediator to negotiate a cease-fire. I met him in Aden. He was a 49-year-old sheik named Ali Abdullah Abdulsalam, who prefers to go by the nom de guerre Mullah Zabara. He was an ebullient man with a strong jaw and a scar on his right temple that gave him a fearsome look. He approached me in the lobby of my hotel, and as he kissed my cheeks \u2014 the standard Arab greeting for men \u2014 I smelled whiskey on his breath. The hotel staff were clearly terrified of him. We sat down, and within minutes he was asking me, with a big devilish grin on his face, how much I would pay for the interview. He said he had information that the C.I.A. would pay a lot of money for. I told him I couldn\u2019t pay anything. He had a sidekick with him, a skinny young tribesman named Taha who sat next to him and soon began whispering, \u201cO.K., that\u2019s enough, drop it.\u201d He dropped it, and then began telling me about his trips to Zinjibar, where he twice met with members of Al Qaeda. After the first trip, he exchanged text messages with a top Qaeda figure named Fahd al-Qusaa, who is wanted by the United States for his role in the U.S.S. Cole bombing in 2000. Al Qaeda leaders never talk on the phone, he explained, because Yemen\u2019s government has voice-recognition software, provided by the United States. (I later confirmed Zabara\u2019s identity and background, and much of his account, through other tribal figures in south Yemen.) He showed me the messages on his phone. They were written in highly formal Arabic and referred briefly to Zabara\u2019s having \u201cprotected\u201d Qusaa (if it was him) in the past. The writer of the message expressed his appreciation for Zabara\u2019s mediation efforts but said the government had lied and refused to suspend their fire during the negotiations. \u201cThese people cannot be trusted,\u201d the message said. \u201cWe will defeat them, and God willing we will conquer Aden.\u201d Zabara told me he refused to give up, and was later granted a meeting with Qusaa\u2019s superiors, whom he named: Said al-Shihri and Qassim al-Raymi, the deputy leader and military commander of Al Qaeda\u2019s Arabian branch. These men were closely involved in the group\u2019s efforts in 2009 and 2010 to set off bombs in airplanes bound for American cities. With Osama bin Laden gone, they are among the top counterterrorism priorities of the United States. Zabara said they were directing the takeover of Zinjibar and other towns, and he had met them in a farmhouse less than an hour\u2019s drive from where we were sitting. His efforts to broker a cease-fire failed.","7537":"Thomas Hegghammer, a terrorism specialist at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the manifesto bears an eerie resemblance to those of Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders, though from a Christian rather than a Muslim point of view.

Countries like Iran may serve vital interests of the United Nations and United States to a far greater degree by making it clear to Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan and elsewhere that being anti-Taliban and anti-bin Laden is not tantamount to being pro-United States. Such a message could help stem unrest in the Pakistan region, which is in urgent need of more moderate pro-Islamic voices.","7540":"Thomas Hegghammer, a terrorism specialist at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the manifesto bears an eerie resemblance to those of Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders, though from a Christian rather than a Muslim point of view.

Leiter, who stepped down three weeks ago as head of the National Counterterrorism Center, are the most significant pushback to a growing chorus of statements by American officials that the death of Osama bin Laden and years of Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes in Pakistan have brought the United States \u201cwithin reach of strategically defeating Al Qaeda,\u201d as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta put it recently.","7551":"THE spring of 2011 brought perhaps the single biggest highlight in the war on terrorism since 9/11: the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Generally, however, it was a frustrating season in the combat zones, as shown below in data from April 1 to June 30 of 2009, 2010 and 2011.","7552":"The White House acted after Osama bin Laden was found living near Pakistan\u2019s leading military academy and Pakistan then expelled American military trainers. Islamabad should see this as a serious warning that Washington has all but run out of patience with its double games. Both sides will pay a high price if this goes on too long.","7553":"ASPEN, Colo. \u2014 President Obama\u2019s top adviser on Pakistan said Friday that the United States had six months to deliver \u201ca knockout blow\u201d to Al Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership in Pakistan while the group was still in turmoil after the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7554":"President Obama's top adviser on Pakistan said that the United States had six months to deliver a knock-out blow to Al Qaeda's senior leadership in Pakistan while the group was still in turmoil after the killing of Osama bin Laden. Page A6","7555":"THE LONGEST WAR: The Enduring Conflict Between America and Al-Qaeda, by Peter L. Bergen (Free Press, $16.) Bergen, a national security analyst for CNN and the author of two previous books about Osama bin Laden, covers the global sweep of the last 10 years \u2014 the Sept. 11 attacks, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, America\u2019s relationship with Pakistan and the death of Bin Laden \u2014 and provides an intimate look at Al Qaeda\u2019s history and motives.","7556":"Relations between Pakistan and the United States have been strained since a Central Intelligence Agency contractor shot two Pakistanis in January, and worsened after the May 2 American raid to kill Osama bin Laden was conducted without alerting the Pakistani authorities.","7557":"Admiral Mullen, who has sought to restore relations with Pakistan damaged by the unilateral American raid that killed Osama bin Laden, acknowledged American frustrations with the pace that Pakistani security forces have moved to cleanse their border regions of militants.","7558":"But Mr. Remnick has shifted more resources toward The New Yorker\u2019s digital enterprise. Nine months ago he hired the magazine\u2019s first news editor, who helps engage its writers on big breaking news like the killing of Osama bin Laden and assigns them to write for the Web site. That was the magazine\u2019s biggest mobilization of resources to put articles online. And Mr. Remnick said he envisioned more of that happening.","7559":"The most important story of the early twenty-first century is the epic convulsion across the Islamic world. Rage against geriatric autocrats is only one part of it. Most of the region \u2014 stretching across three continents, from Morocco on the Atlantic to Indonesia on the Pacific \u2014 is also actively rebelling against radical ideologies. Muslim societies are now moving beyond jihadism, not only because of the dramatic death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.","756":"Officials here believe that the Abu Sayyaf, which has about 300 members, received seed money from groups associated with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks. Mrs. Arroyo noted that 'Abu Sayyaf was established in 1990 or 1991, and that's when those organizations were here.'","7560":"Like Peter L. Bergen in his recent book, \u201cThe Longest War,\u201d Ms. Wright argues that Osama bin Laden miscalculated the consequences of the 9/11 attacks. Like Mr. Bergen, she points to the emergence of powerful new critics of Al Qaeda, who had jihadi credentials themselves, most notably Sheik Salman al-Awdah , whom she describes as \u201cone of bin Laden\u2019s earliest role models\u201d and who in 2007 issued an open letter to that Qaeda leader, condemning him for spilling the blood of innocent people.","7561":"(Is this a reference to Osama bin Laden or someone much more obscure? Were the \u201cresponsible authorities\u201d trying to put off an attack because the individual was not at the location, or because he was? Darpa officials did not return e-mails requesting comment.)","7562":"President Obama last visited the World Trade Center in early May, just days after he announced that Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks, had been killed in a raid in Pakistan.","7563":"Mr. Obama, whose youth and relative inexperience were used against him in the 2008 election, has aged visibly, most noticeably in his hair color, now less salt-and-pepper than a generous dusting of salt. After two and a half years in which he soldiered through the Great Recession and sent a Seal team to assassinate Osama bin Laden, this president stopped seeming young a long time ago.","7564":"During the 2008 campaign, President Obama and his rivals for the nomination used to talk a lot about how they were going to rid the world of both Osama bin Laden and the Bush administration\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy. Turns out that, of the two, Bin Laden was a whole lot easier to kill.","7565":"The base attack also came as the Pakistan military was still reeling from another big humiliation three weeks earlier \u2014 the American commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda leader, in a residential compound near a Pakistan military garrison only a few hours from Islamabad. Bin Laden\u2019s location alone raised suspicions that some people in the Pakistan military knew he was hiding there.","7566":"The president\u2019s overall job approval rating remained relatively stable, with 48 percent approving of the way he handles his job as president and 47 percent disapproving \u2014 down from the bump up he received in the spring after the killing of Osama bin Laden, but in line with how he has been viewed for nearly a year. By contrast, Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, saw his disapproval rating shoot up 16 points since April: 57 percent of those polled now disapprove of the way he is handling his job, while only 30 percent approve.","7567":"KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 In the deadliest day for American forces in the nearly decade-long war in Afghanistan, insurgents shot down a Chinook transport helicopter on Saturday, killing 30 Americans, including some Navy Seal commandos from the unit that killed Osama bin Laden, as well as 8 Afghans, American and Afghan officials said.","7569":"While this new deterrence may not work with suicide bombers once they have strapped on an explosive vest \u2014 or Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden\u2019s successor atop Al Qaeda \u2014 it does with terrorist facilitators like gunrunners, financiers, brokers who find safe houses and many others involved only for personal gain and not to make jihad.","757":"Soon after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some military officials suggested that the United States would seek to use Pakistan as a major staging area for air and ground attacks against Osama bin Laden and the radical Islamic Taliban government that shelters him in Afghanistan.","7570":"Mr. Reeves, a chief petty officer who had turned 32 just days ago, was accepted for Naval Special Warfare training in 1999. He passed the harsh winnowing process to qualify for Seal Team 6, the counterterrorism unit that conducted the raid into Pakistan on May 2 that killed Osama bin Laden.","7571":"The first six months of 2011 brought the kind of news explosion that can be a boon for major news organizations: the Arab Spring, nuclear catastrophe in Japan, a royal wedding and the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7572":"That\u2019s the suspicion of Representative Peter T. King, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Mr. King has asked the inspectors general of the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency to investigate the administration\u2019s cooperation with filmmakers planning a movie based on the Navy Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","7573":"Let\u2019s not forget President Obama\u2019s real accomplishments: the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform, the Start treaty, the end of the odious \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d military policy, two superb Supreme Court nominations, a restored Environmental Protection Agency under Lisa Jackson, a restored Justice Department under Eric H. Holder Jr., an effective secretary of state in Hillary Rodham Clinton and the successful raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","7574":"That's the suspicion of Representative Peter T. King, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Mr. King has asked the inspectors general of the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency to investigate the administration's cooperation with filmmakers planning a movie based on the Navy Seal raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","7575":"\u201cWas he trying to meet Osama bin Laden? Who knows,\u201d said Sidney Jones, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in Jakarta. \u201cWas he trying to get to Afghanistan to fight? That\u2019s one possibility. Was he trying to open channels for training for Southeast Asians from the Philippines and Indonesia? That\u2019s another possibility. We don\u2019t know the answers and it\u2019s critical to find out.\u201d","7576":"In addition to the members of the Seals, the dead included three Air Force Special Operations members, an Army helicopter crew of five, seven Afghan commandos and an Afghan interpreter. A military dog also died. Among the Seals members were members of the elite counterterrorism unit that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May, but none of the crash victims were on the Bin Laden mission.","7577":"On a Sunday night in May, hours before Americans took to the streets blasting Miley Cyrus\u2019s \u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d in celebration of the death of Osama bin Laden, I saw the Gregory Brothers perform live at the Gramercy Theater in Manhattan. The band was playing on a YouTube-sponsored concert series called the Digitour, featuring artists who had become popular primarily through online videos, and the Gregory Brothers closed the show after being introduced as \u201cthe viral video wonders of the world.\u201d Performing alongside screens that showed the now-familiar footage of Radcliff, Vasquez and Dodson, the Gregorys sang tuneful versions of \u201cBackin Up Song (feat. Diana)\u201d and \u201cBed Intruder Song.\u201d Newer numbers like \u201cRent: Too Damn High! Song,\u201d featuring the prodigiously bearded mayoral candidate Jimmy McMillan, and a songified version of Christine O\u2019Donnell declaring, \u201cI\u2019m not a witch,\u201d seemed to go over the heads of many concertgoers, but the band found a crowd pleaser in \u201cWinning,\u201d a song distilled from a series of quotable interviews given by Charlie Sheen. (\u201cI was banging seven-gram rocks, that\u2019s how I roll/Winning/I have one gear: go\u201d).","7578":"Relations between Pakistan and the United States have sharply deteriorated since January, when a security contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency shot and killed two Pakistanis in Lahore, and worsened after American commandos flew into Pakistan in May to kill Osama bin Laden without notifying Pakistan.","7579":"His political instincts remained sharp. In May, after the death of Osama bin Laden, he remarked on Republican proposals for changing Medicare, telling The Times, \u201cThat\u2019s almost as good for the Democrats as Bin Laden.\u201d","758":"SECRETARY POWELL -- The cables that we sent out really had several pieces to them. One, the history of the organization and the fact that we have every right to go after them because they've already been indicted, Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, for past crimes against the U.S. and against civilization. And we make sure we understand that. . . .","7580":"In his most recent thriller, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Light,\u201d Richard North Patterson wrote a detailed plot in which Osama bin Laden tries to drop a nuclear bomb on the United States to coincide with the 10th anniversary of 9/11.","7581":"WASHINGTON \u2014 In the days after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service probably allowed Chinese military engineers to examine the wreckage of a stealth American helicopter that crashed during the operation, according to American officials and others familiar with the classified intelligence assessments.","7582":"The raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May showed Pakistan that the United States would respect its sovereignty only so far. A cooperative campaign against common enemies offers them the best chance of controlling American actions in their country. And Pakistani participation in the targeting of drone strikes would remove a major source of anti-American resentment.","7583":"In his most recent thriller, 'The Devil's Light,' Richard North Patterson wrote a detailed plot in which Osama bin Laden tries to drop a nuclear bomb on the United States to coincide with the 10th anniversary of 9/11.","7585":"China on Tuesday dismissed a report that Pakistan gave it access to an advanced American helicopter that crashed in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, forcing commandos to abandon it. \u201cThis report is totally unfounded and extremely absurd,\u201d China\u2019s Defense Ministry said on its Web site. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Pakistani authorities gave China access to the wreckage despite C.I.A. requests to Pakistan to keep it under wraps.","7586":"In Pakistan, the military is the problem. After all, Osama bin Laden was found and killed in a city that also hosts one of the country\u2019s largest military academies. Is there any doubt that the Pakistani Army and intelligence services were aware that the No. 1 enemy of America was living under their noses?","7587":"In another presidential primary season, that might have been a good thing. The notion of a Lone Star independent streak fueled the Western movies that helped build Hollywood and later propelled George W. Bush into the White House. He relied on it to place himself above the beltway fray. And he could get away with sounding like a gunslinger when he said he wanted Osama bin Laden \u201cdead or alive\u201d because he was expressing an anger shared by the entire country. He harked back to a time when the fights were simpler and the guy in the white hat won. Still, some of us cringed. His wording played a little too simple. He sounded like he was borrowing from the stereotype, which is worse than embodying it.","7589":"BAGHDAD \u2014 One of the most powerful insurgent groups in Iraq, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, released a statement on Saturday, warning that it had launched a 100-attack campaign to exact revenge for the United States\u2019 killing of Osama bin Laden.","759":"On June 22 the Spanish police arrested Muhammad Bensakhria, an Algerian described as a deputy to Osama bin Laden, who was extradited to France to face conspiracy charges in connection with a reported plot to attack targets in Strasbourg, including the European Parliament. The police suspect a link with Mr. Atta but, Mr. Cotino said, 'we can't prove it.'","7590":"Weeks \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best Sellers: E-Book NonfictionThis Last On Week Week List 1 1 4 A STOLEN LIFE, by Jaycee Dugard.

Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has long claimed an affiliation to Bin Laden's group, and has clearly taken inspiration from the larger group. Page 10","7593":"For all that, Mr. Obama seems unlikely to get much political payoff from the events in Libya. Part of the reason stems from his multilateral approach \u2014 very different, for example, from the commando raid he ordered on Osama bin Laden. That gave him a measurable bounce in the polls, though it, too, proved fleeting as anxieties about the economy crept back.","7594":"The attack, coming four days after Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia released a statement saying it was in the midst of a 100-attack campaign in Iraq to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden, underscored the country\u2019s tenuous security situation as the United States prepares to withdraw its roughly 48,000 remaining troops by the end of the year.","7596":"Most of the information we\u2019re finding is useful, but be wary, especially of photos. Some people will use this major news event to doctor and then share photos as a prank as they did when Osama bin Laden was captured.

The group said this month that it had begun a 100-attack campaign to avenge the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7603":"At least six movies set for release in the coming months received substantial backing from Ms. Ellison and her company. They include \u201cThe Master,\u201d a drama about a cult that resembles Scientology that stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and is being directed by Paul Thomas Anderson of \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d fame. Another high-profile project, still untitled, tackles the killing of Osama bin Laden; it is being written and produced by Mark Boal and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, both Oscar winners for \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d","7604":"The death of Osama bin Laden was viewed as reason for officials to \u201cminimize references to Al Qaeda.\u201d While terrorists affiliated with Bin Laden\u2019s network \u201cstill have the ability to inflict harm,\u201d the guidelines say, officials are to make the point that \u201cAl Qaeda and its adherents have become increasingly irrelevant.\u201d","7605":"But even as Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership continues to project an image of control, many terrorism experts and American intelligence officials say that the members of this circle of maybe a dozen operatives \u2014 many of whom served for years as Osama bin Laden\u2019s closest confidants \u2014 are at risk of being marginalized not only by the global jihad movement but by the Qaeda affiliates they helped spawn. With their ranks thinned by a relentless barrage of drone strikes, some experts believe, Al Qaeda\u2019s operatives in Pakistan resemble a driver holding a steering wheel that is no longer attached to the car.","7606":"9 P.M. (Fox News Channel) HANNITY Sean Hannity interviews Dick Cheney -- whose new memoir, 'In My Time,' has been released -- about his time as vice president, including his relationship with former President George W. Bush, 9/11, the war in Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7607":"But if the West and its allies in Libya keep pushing Qaddafi to surrender then Qaddafi will seek cover in a third country, as Osama bin Laden did, and plan attacks on other Western countries.","7609":"Before his promotion, Admiral McRaven was in charge of the Joint Special Operations Command, a part of the overall command that oversees the missions of the military\u2019s most highly trained strike units. He held that post during the May 2 raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, a success that was discussed publicly by senior administration officials even though it involved a Seals unit that in the past the Pentagon would not even confirm existed.","7610":"But the Republican candidates are also eager to describe Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy as a failure \u2014 a task made more difficult by the president\u2019s recent success in killing Osama bin Laden and driving Muammar el-Qaddafi from power in Libya.","7611":"In the aftermath of 9/11, I had my students write a letter to Osama bin Laden. I saved the letters to use as primary sources with my future students. On the first anniversary, I had my students write as essay about their memories of 9/11. I saved the essays, too. Every year I have done a lesson remembering. I show a DVD of the news coverage of the event. Then I bring out the bin Laden letters and the memory essays. The students love to read the accounts from the students who were their age at the time. For several years now the middle school age students do not remember 9/11. For some it is the first they even heard of it. \u2014 Annette Duffy","7612":"At the end of June, Mr. Cuspert recorded a nasheed that praised Al Qaeda\u2019s late leader, Osama bin Laden. \u201cYour name flows in our blood,\u201d he sings.","7613":"For that matter, fantasy epics \u2014 pitting good versus evil in stark Manichaean terms \u2014 dominated the box office in the last decade: among the top-grossing films were \u201cAvatar,\u201d two installments of \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d three installments of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Superheroes like Spider-Man and Iron Man ruled, and so did vampires. There was a lot of intellectualizing about all this: arguments that the fantasy boom embodied Americans\u2019 need for escapism after 9/11; that superhero sagas offered audiences a way to process the tragedy; that vampires, like terrorists, pose a deadly threat but often hide in plain sight. Steven Spielberg said his 2005 remake of \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d reflected post-9/11 anxiety. Time\u2019s Richard Corliss described the Joker in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d as \u201cthe terrorist as improv artist.\u201d And bloggers compared Voldemort and his Death Eaters in \u201cHarry Potter\u201d to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","7614":"At the end of June, Mr. Cuspert recorded a nasheed that praised Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden. 'Your name flows in our blood,' he sings.","7615":"The final chapter of the life of Rick Rescorla, who was the second vice president for corporate security for Morgan Stanley at the World Trade Center, has also been documented in a 2002 film from the History Channel, \u201cThe Man Who Predicted 9/11.\u201d Convinced that Osama bin Laden would attack the World Trade Center, Rescorla had developed a detailed evacuation plan, and on Sept. 11 he defied official instructions and implemented it.","7616":"KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 A combined Afghan and coalition force killed a suspected insurgent leader in eastern Afghanistan, NATO officials said on Saturday. The man was believed to be a former detainee at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, who at one time was accused of helping Osama bin Laden escape from Tora Bora after the fall of the Taliban.","7617":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Every day, Michael G. Vickers gets an update on how many in Al Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership the United States has removed from the battlefield, and lately there has been much to report. Al Qaeda\u2019s No. 2 died in a C.I.A. drone strike late last month, another senior commander was taken out in June, and the Navy Seals made history when they dispatched Osama bin Laden in May.","7618":"Weeks \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best Sellers: Hardcover NonfictionThis Last On Week Week List 1 1 6 A STOLEN LIFE, by Jaycee Dugard.

The author's curious exploration of the nature of knowledge pivots on the European Enlightenment.","7619":"In an audacious operation that unfolded like a Hollywood thriller, the Navy Seals executed a daring raid deep into Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden. The departing members of the Seals took not only the body of bin Laden but also a cache of invaluable intelligence on his organization, Al Qaeda. It is fitting that Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker, veteran security correspondents for The New York Times, begin and end their insightful new book about United States counterterrorism efforts with this triumph. The United States, they argue, could not have pulled off the same raid 10 years ago. The bin Laden strike was the \u201clogical culmination of nearly a decade of missteps, mistakes, trial and error under fire, and ultimately lessons not only learned but taken to heart.\u201d","762":"PARIS, Oct. 2\u2014 A Frenchman of Algerian background has told French investigators that he was part of a plot by Osama bin Laden to blow up the American Embassy in Paris, according to a French official familiar with the testimony.","7620":"After the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, he claimed to be on the side of the Americans in the hunt for Al Qaeda, but United States troops accused him of helping Osama bin Laden and his allies flee to Pakistan.","7621":"Osama bin Laden is dead. So is Saddam Hussein, and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and too many Qaeda No. 3\u2019s to count. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is awaiting his military tribunal. George W. Bush is home on the ranch, Dick Cheney is on book tour, and even Gen. David Petraeus is a general no more, having traded in his stars for a civilian position atop the Central Intelligence Agency.","7622":"By chance, the scheduled two-day interview began the day after American forces killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Michael Cascio, the senior vice president for production at the National Geographic Channel, said Mr. Bush and his associates had placed no restrictions on the interview.","7623":"The shift in tone was particularly noticeable for Pakistan, which has been bitter toward the United States in the four months since its military was surprised, humiliated and infuriated by the Navy Seals raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.","7624":"Relations between Washington and Islamabad have not recovered since the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The administration needs to keep searching for ways to revive a working relationship and change the self-destructive mind-set of Pakistan\u2019s leaders. Ending all aid would be a serious mistake, but withholding certain military aid, as the administration has done, could help.","7625":"8 P.M. (History) TARGETING BIN LADEN This two-hour documentary, which looks at efforts to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden, features interviews with President Obama; senior White House officials, including Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser; and Ryan Zinke, a former member of the Navy's Seal Team 6. Re-enactments and news footage help tell the story of the raid on the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, during which bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader, was killed in May.","7626":"Attacks across the country, particularly in the western province of Anbar, have increased significantly as insurgents have deployed a variety of deadly means including ambushes, improvised explosive devices and car bombs to kill civilians and Iraqi security forces. The recent increase has raised fears about a resurgence of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which once controlled large areas of Anbar and said in August that it would conduct 100 attacks to avenge the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7627":"Now I think of these kids, who watched people cheering in the streets after an elite assassination team killed Osama bin Laden, and wonder what that flag means to them.","7629":"But Mr. Obama is walking a delicate line, his advisers say, seeking to honor the victims of a national tragedy and their families while underscoring how much progress his administration has made in the fight against Al Qaeda, most notably the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","763":"In 1994, two jetliners were hijacked by people who wanted to crash them into buildings, one of them by an Islamic militant group. And the 2000 edition of the F.A.A.'s annual report on Criminal Acts Against Aviation, published this year, said that although Osama bin Laden 'is not known to have attacked civil aviation, he has both the motivation and the wherewithal to do so,' adding, 'Bin Laden's anti-Western and anti-American attitudes make him and his followers a significant threat to civil aviation, particularly to U.S. civil aviation.'","7630":"The killing of Osama bin Laden has not closed the book. Nor has 10 years.","7631":"There was every reason to chase down the 9/11 organizers before they could take more innocent lives. Osama bin Laden killed civilians before, promised to do it again, and did. Immediately, the hunt began for him and his deputies, with help from much of the world. Al Qaeda was a palpable danger. No soldiers in Afghanistan would have asked, in those days, about the doubts of New Yorkers.","7633":"It is the tomb of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the fallen leader of the Northern Alliance and passionate foe of the Taliban, who was assassinated in Afghanistan two days before the Sept. 11 attacks. His killing, intelligence analysts have come to realize, should have been seen as a warning bell for the carefully planned attacks in the United States. Mr. Massoud was struck by two suspected Al Qaeda suicide bombers posing as journalists in a killing directly ordered by Osama bin Laden.","7634":"Then, just months later, the Arab world was shaken by popular demands not for shariah, but for democracy. Al Qaeda found itself decidedly on the sidelines. In May came the killing of Osama bin Laden. The image of the graying Qaeda founder wielding not a bomb but a remote control capped the impression of a terrorist network in steep decline, made increasingly irrelevant by its own arid doctrine, its brutal tactics and the unpredictable course of history.","7635":"The news about Osama bin Laden\u2019s death came while he was studying on a Sunday night. His cellphone flashed a stream of text messages from his friends. His mother called out to him that the president would be addressing the nation.","7636":"Even those that give some information may not provide enough context to make it understandable. One 2005 textbook, \u201cAmerica: Pathways to the Present,\u201d said the \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the attacks was Osama bin Laden, but described him only as \u201ca wealthy Saudi dissident\u201d who had been granted sanctuary in Afghanistan by the Taliban, a \u201cgroup\u201d that wanted to establish \u201ctheir version of a pure Islamic state, banning such things as television and music.\u201d","7637":"The Arab Spring has turned that formula inside out, negating premises fundamental to a world that bore and nurtured Osama bin Laden. Arab majorities, still harboring resentment toward Western policies, are first looking inward to promote change, blaming their own leaders for decades of political, economic and cultural decline. There is a degree of societal introspection taking place, one that was pointless in totalitarian societies that discouraged, and often punished, civic participation.","7638":"The killing of Osama bin Laden is not viewed as having long-lasting effects on safety and terrorism. Only 22 percent of the American public thinks the threat of terrorism against the United States has eased since Bin Laden was killed in May.","7639":"On that score, the killing of Osama bin Laden changed nothing, said Mr. Mukasey, who reinforced the point by invoking a favorite source for conservatives, Winston Churchill. After an important Allied victory in World War II, Churchill said: \u201cThis is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u201d In the war against Islamists, Mr. Mukasey said, we have yet to make it to that end of the beginning.","764":"It is important to demonstrate to the world that America stands for justice in its response to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. By sharing some of its evidence linking Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network Al Qaeda to those attacks with foreign leaders this week, the Bush administration has honored fundamental American values. A portion of this material should be made public as well. Secretary of State Colin Powell was right to promise such a presentation of evidence last month. It would help build stronger international support for the campaign against terrorism.","7643":"Mr. Chandler noted that in a notebook seized after Osama bin Laden was killed, the Al Qaeda leader speculated about mounting an attack 10 years after Sept. 11 or on another symbolic date.","7646":"Last week, I lamented that Feynman, a biography about the physicist Richard P. Feynman published by First Second, had not yet appeared on the list. But now it has arrived \u2013 and it sits atop the hardcover graphic novels list. \u201cFeynman\u201d is an engaging read. For more on the man, visit the robust collection of articles on his Times Topics page. Another book that is sure to get some attention is \u201cCode Word: Geronimo,\u201d about the Navy Seals mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. It was written by Dale Dye, a retired captain who served in the United States Marine Corps, and his wife, Julia Dye, and illustrated by Gerry Kissell and Amin Amat. For more on Capt. Dye, read the 2005 profile from Arts &amp; Leisure about his Hollywood consulting business. Click here to read more on the men in the unit, unofficially called Seal Team 6. As always, the complete lists can be found here, along with an explanation of how they were assembled.","765":"A senior government official in Pakistan said law enforcement authorities were certain that Osama bin Laden's network used hawala to transfer money to agents outside Afghanistan, along with conventional means. But the nature of hawala will make tracking those particular exchanges almost impossible.","7650":"Certainly, as Sept. 11 approaches, the idea of revenge is in the air, as are questions about it. Is vengeance the way of nations? Was it worth it? What is the difference between revenge and justice? Does violence merely beget violence? Greenwald, in the same post cited above makes the connection to the American cheering that followed the killing of Osama bin Laden. (\u201cIn all cases, performing giddy dances over state-produced corpses is odious and wrong.\u201d)","7651":"They were there same as me, those two, trying to be helpful, and I walked away. I doubt any of us could have picked Osama bin Laden out of a lineup at that point. It\u2019s the last thing I can remember of politics if you don\u2019t count vengeful graffiti or wearable slogans.","7653":"In a notebook found in the compound of Osama bin Laden after he was killed in May, the Qaeda leader mused about the possibility of mounting an attack on the 9/11 anniversary, and the police in New York and Washington were already on alert for trouble.","7654":"\u00b6 Connecticut has agreed to play in a game aboard an aircraft carrier on San Diego Bay in 2012. Its opponent could be Kansas, Texas, Florida, Arizona or Illinois. The inaugural Carrier Classic will be played this Nov. 11 \u2014 Veterans Day \u2014 between North Carolina and Michigan State on the flight deck of the Carl Vinson, the ship from which Osama bin Laden was buried at sea.","7655":"\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the fight to Al Qaeda like never before,\u201d the president said.\u00a0\u201cOver the past two and a half years, more senior Al Qaeda leaders have been eliminated than at any time since 9/11.\u00a0 And thanks to the remarkable courage and precision of our forces, we finally delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.\u201d","7656":"There was a basic failure not only to appreciate but even to comprehend the perspective of the West. Even when challenged \u2014 and these were not men accustomed to being challenged \u2014 with the argument that whatever the perceived rights and wrongs of their cause, they would inevitably be bracketed with Osama bin Laden because, especially after 9/11, few in the West cared much about how they calibrated the motivation behind a suicide bomb.","7659":"As a family, we have become more vocal in our feelings. My nephew Dan recently got into an argument with other college students who questioned the need to assassinate Osama bin Laden, the terrorist behind the attacks.","766":"Both Russia and Iran are enemies of the Taliban government in Afghanistan and of Osama bin Laden.","7660":"At the July 1 charity event, Mr. Heeran\u2019s older brother, Sean, stepped to a microphone. His voice broke as he saluted the killing of Osama bin Laden: \u201cHere\u2019s a shout-out to Seal Team 6!\u201d","7661":"In \u201cThe Missing Martyrs,\u201d Charles Kurzman suggests that even before Osama bin Laden was killed, his movement had failed utterly. Al Qaeda\u2019s ideological trademark is to exhort ordinary Muslims to engage in individual acts of violence against those deemed enemies of Islam, specifically Americans, Jews and the infidel rulers of Muslim-\u00admajority states. And yet very few such attacks have occurred in the United States since Sept. 11, and certainly none comparable to the devastating events of that day. To emphasize just how surprising this is, Kurzman cites a 2006 online manual for aspiring jihadists that lists 14 \u201csimple tools\u201d that \u201care easy to use and available for anyone who wants to fight the occupying enemy\u201d \u2014 they include \u201crunning over someone with a car\u201d and \u201csetting fire to homes or rooms at sleep time.\u201d Kurzman, a sociologist who has written widely about Islamic reform movements, asks: \u201cIf terrorist methods are as widely available as automobiles, why are there so few Islamist terrorists? In light of the death and devastation that terrorists have wrought, the question may seem absurd. But if there are more than a billion Muslims in the world, many of whom supposedly hate the West and desire martyrdom, why don\u2019t we see terrorist attacks everywhere, every day?\u201d","7662":"Gym Jones has another reason to guard its privacy: its military customers like it that way. Although the Twights refuse to talk much about this side of their business, which occurs inside the gym and in the nearby mountains, it appears to be considerable and to involve people who are supposed to be invisible. Six of Mr. Twight\u2019s former students, for instance, were among the 30 Americans \u2014 most of them Navy Seals, including members of the team that killed Osama bin Laden \u2014 who died in Afghanistan in August when their helicopter was shot down.","7663":"IF 2012 is really the end of the road for President Obama, it is possible to see how historians might look favorably on his term. The president has already accomplished a great deal. His health care reform legislation promises to expand health insurance to millions of people and correct a number of flaws in our current system. His economic stimulus helped to stave off a second Depression and preserve the auto industry, while his financial regulations are meant to curb some of the abuses that led to the financial collapse of 2008. He has used executive power to strengthen some environmental regulations, while on foreign policy the killing of Osama bin Laden constituted an important step in the war on terrorism. Most recently, the role of the United States in the collapse of the rule of Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya marks another victory in the struggle against dictatorships.","7664":"There was every reason to chase down the 9/11 organizers before they could take more innocent lives. Osama bin Laden killed civilians before, promised to do it again, and did. Immediately, the hunt began for him and his deputies, with help from much of the world. Al Qaeda was a palpable danger. No soldiers in Afghanistan would have asked, in those days, about the doubts of New Yorkers.","7665":"But now that Osama bin Laden is gone, this is the time for negotiations with the Taliban, to bring them into the community because long-lasting war is in no one\u2019s interests. When schools are built, they destroy them, and some neighboring countries are interfering in our affairs.","7667":"In May, Mr. Bush declined Mr. Obama\u2019s invitation to join him at ground zero after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. But on this morning, they stood shoulder to shoulder \u2014 commanders in chief whose terms in office are bookends for exploring how the United States has changed since Sept. 11, 2001, particularly in its response to terrorism.","7668":"It seemed like only yesterday: the indelible images of the twin towers smoking and disintegrating, of people falling as if in a dream. Yet a decade had gone, thousands more had died in wars, America had endured economic hardships and natural disasters, had learned to live with terrorist threats and had at last killed Osama bin Laden.","7669":"There was an overnight suicide bombing involving an explosives-packed truck in Afghanistan, the arrests of terrorism suspects in Berlin and Sweden and heightened security alerts most everywhere. There was analysis about how democratic values have triumphed in the Arab Spring, which has been seen as a defeat for Al Qaeda. But even with Osama bin Laden dead, Al Qaeda or its offshoots remain active in the chaotic areas of Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and the Maghreb, and its ideology still inspires some to plan attacks against the United States and its allies.","767":"With their oxymoronic holy war, Osama bin Laden and his murderous disciples meant to expose our moral vacuity. But they exposed only their own.","7670":"WASHINGTON \u2014 In a new memoir, a former F.B.I. agent who tracked Al Qaeda before and after the Sept. 11 attacks paints a devastating picture of rivalry and dysfunction inside the government\u2019s counterterrorism agencies. The book describes missed opportunities to defuse the 2001 plot, and argues that other attacks overseas might have been prevented, and Osama bin Laden found earlier, if interrogations had not been mismanaged.","7673":"Ten years later, the way our friends were taken from us and their families remains totally cruel and unfair. Yet, I do feel proud of the way that Sandler O\u2019Neill fought back and represented our fallen friends to the rest of the world. Now, I no longer think of our efforts as a reaction to terrorism. I view it as a tribute to our fallen colleagues. It\u2019s not about Osama bin Laden. We are responding to Ken McBrayer, Herman Sandler, Chris Quackenbush and the other 66 men and women of Sandler O\u2019Neill whom we lost much too soon.","7675":"Dictatorships of the past ruined the country, and democracy seems like a sham. Politicians have failed to uphold civilian supremacy. The military and intelligence services, which went on a back-foot after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, continue to dominate the national political landscape.","7677":"I was impressed by all the stories of tragedy and heroism in your 9/11 special section, \u201cThe Reckoning.\u201d In \u201cThe Price of Lost Chances,\u201d I was struck by Osama bin Laden\u2019s gloating comment about his plan for \u201cbleeding America to the point of bankruptcy.\u201d","7678":"After 9/11, we invaded Afghanistan \u2014 justifiably \u2014 to take the fight to our enemies. But we also invaded Iraq, an unjustified war for which 9/11 provided the cover. We have killed Osama bin Laden and many other Al Qaeda leaders, but 9/11 has also given us waterboarding, Guant\u00e1namo, and the gradual erosion of some of our civil liberties, which we foolishly accept in the name of security.","7679":"Now, Congressman Paul, that is irresponsible. A president of the United States, running for -- someone who's running for the president of the United States in the Republican Party -- (applause) -- should not be parroting what Osama bin Laden said on 9/11. We should have -- we -- we are -- we are not being -- we are not being attacked and we were not attacked because of our actions.","768":"ROLE OF EGYPTIANS -- The Egyptian Islamic Jihad, once pushed into exile, now forms a backbone for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. B4","7680":"Ms. Hochul\u2019s victory should not be forgotten about, as it\u2019s a sign of how volatile the results in individual elections can be, and how rapidly the political climate can shift. That election was held at a time when Mr. Obama\u2019s standing was relatively strong in national polls, following the news that Osama bin Laden had been killed.","7682":"Instead, North Waziristan has become a main target of American drone strikes conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. Some military officials say the Haqqanis have not been hit as hard as they might have been for fear of worsening relations with Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency, so close are its ties to the network. The Pakistan military has done its best to shut down the drone campaign as relations with the United States have soured after the killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos operating deep inside Pakistan.","7683":"Government experts consider the ascendancy of regional affiliates of Al Qaeda as especially worrisome. Al Qaeda\u2019s traditional leadership in Pakistan is deemed less capable of planning and carrying out significant attacks, especially since the death of Osama bin Laden in May. But Pentagon and intelligence officials hold that regional affiliates \u2014 in particular the Qaeda branch in Yemen \u2014 pose increasing threats to American interests today.","7684":"The strike comes less than a month after a C.I.A. drone killed Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, a Libyan who was promoted to become Al Qaeda\u2019s second-ranking operative after the death of Osama bin Laden in May. The C.I.A. in recent months has also killed Ilyas Kashmiri, a Pakistani militant commander who worked closely with Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership.","7685":"But the unresolved question is whether the administration can escalate attacks if it wants to against rank-and-file members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, and the Somalia-based Shabab. The answer could lay the groundwork for a shift in the fight against terrorists as the original Al Qaeda, operating out of Afghanistan and Pakistan, grows weaker. That organization has been crippled by the killing of Osama bin Laden and by a fierce campaign of drone strikes in the tribal regions of Pakistan, where the legal authority to attack militants who are battling United States forces in adjoining Afghanistan is not disputed inside the administration.","7686":"The five terrorists who boarded United Airlines Flight 175 in Boston on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, passed through a security checkpoint that was staffed by some screeners who could not speak or understand English, did not know who Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda were, and, in one case, could not identify what Mace was, according to new court documents.","7687":"The remarks resonated in part because some Democrats on Capitol Hill and even at the White House appear now to be circling ominously around William M. Daley, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff. Since taking over the job in January, Mr. Daley has reportedly hardened the lines of command in the West Wing while also limiting access to the president. He deserves some credit for having deftly handled complex situations, most notably the operation against Osama bin Laden, and for trying to repair the breach between the administration and the business community.","7688":"Relations with Pakistan have not recovered from a near-rupture after the killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos operating deep inside Pakistan in early May.","7689":"\u201cConfidence Men,\u201d Mr. Suskind says, was based on interviews with more than 200 people, including former and current members of the Obama administration, as well as the president himself. Because the book essentially begins with Mr. Obama\u2019s crash course in economics as a candidate and ends in early 2011, Mr. Suskind does not place the mismanagement and indecisiveness he describes in these pages in perspective with the tough-minded decision by Mr. Obama to sign off on the high-risk mission that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in May. Given the country\u2019s continuing economic woes, high unemployment and worries among Democrats about Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election prospects, the book makes for timely reading, though its truncated scope means that it does not deal with the debt ceiling fight or Mr. Obama\u2019s more recent efforts to address the jobs crisis.","769":"The terror network headed by Osama bin Laden has tried to develop a high-strength form of heroin that it planned to export to the United States and Western Europe, according to intelligence reports received by United States officials.","7690":"Jonathan Chait pointed out in The Times Magazine recently that the liberal repudiation of Obama \u201cwishes away any constraints upon his power.\u201d (See Republican intransigence, above.) It also undervalues some real accomplishments, achieved despite a brutally divided government. Lost in the shouting is the fact that Obama pulled the country back from the brink of depression; signed a health care reform law that expands coverage, preserves choice and creates a mechanism for controlling costs; engineered a fairly stringent financial regulatory reform; and authorized the risky mission that got Osama bin Laden.","7691":"Mr. Yergin is back with a sequel to \u201cThe Prize.\u201d It is called \u201cThe Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World,\u201d and, if anything, it\u2019s an even better book. It is searching, impartial and alarmingly up to date. (Events like the partial meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear complex in Japan, the political upheavals in Egypt and Libya, and the killing of Osama bin Laden, all from this year, are combed into his arguments.) Mr. Yergin brooks no cant about climate-change denial, and lingers on the topic of cleaner future fuels. Our heads may be buried in our sleek laptops and gadgets, his masterly book announces, but our toes are still soaking in dirty, morally contaminated oil.","7692":"And how. As this combustible 80-minute play continues \u2014 with all the parts embodied by a young cast of spirited chameleons (Francis Benhamou, Nick Choksi, Andrew Ramcharan Guilarte and Bobby Moreno) \u2014 Abulkasem shows up in a number of incarnations. He\u2019s the alter ego of both a nerdy telemarketer (and would-be pick-up artist) and an immigrant apple picker, whose first language is Arabic. Most significant, Abulkasem is the name of an enigmatic, Osama bin Laden-like figure who is discussed in uncomprehending, ever-changing detail by a panel of experts on terrorism (whose names are anagrams for politicians like George Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld).","7693":"American covert raids into Pakistan are rare \u2014 only two, including the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, have become public \u2014 but some American intelligence officials argue that more aggressive ground raids in Pakistan are necessary.","7694":"He also suggested that the American military\u2019s killing of Osama bin Laden last May and the disposal of his body at sea were part of a dark conspiracy to conceal the real perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks.","7695":"Gym Jones has another reason to guard its privacy: its _________ customers like it that way.

Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Leon E. Panetta, the secretary of defense.","7698":"The Pentagon hopes public exposure will shame the Pakistanis \u2014 who receive billions of dollars in aid \u2014 into changing their behavior. That didn\u2019t happen after Osama bin Laden was discovered hiding in plain sight next door to Pakistan\u2019s top military academy. But Washington needs to keep pushing and keep reminding the Pakistanis that the extremists pose a mortal threat to their own country.","77":"The office of the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan strongly denounced criticism this week that it had unfairly singled out Muslims during its broad investigation of Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities believe masterminded the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.","770":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 3\u2014 Secretary of State Colin L.

In the latest of a series of ever bolder strikes, the group staged a daylong assault on the United States Embassy in Kabul, an attack Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, charged Thursday was aided by Pakistan\u2019s military spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. According to two American officials, cellphones used by the attackers made calls to suspected ISI operatives before the attack, although top Pakistani officials deny their government played any role.","7703":"The musician Bruce Hornsby performed at the Woodside fund-raiser.

Since 2008, American missile strikes have killed many of its operatives in the tribal areas of Pakistan and made it difficult for members to communicate. Analysts consider the group\u2019s new leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, uninspiring for attracting young militants.","7714":"\u201cThe most memorable night for us was when the news of the death of Osama bin Laden broke. People were immediately on SSchat and we were sharing resources and ideas on how to bring this into our classrooms the next day.\u201d","7716":"The president got a healthy bump in the polls after ordering the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May. But that goodwill evaporated a month later, as concerns about the economy resurged. In the New York Times/CBS News poll, his approval rating shot up to 57 percent, from 46 percent, after the raid, but fell back to 48 percent in early June.","7718":"Unlike Osama bin Laden, whose convoluted Arabic-language Web messages struck many Western Muslims as foreign and strange, Mr. Awlaki\u2019s unaccented English, sprinkled with colloquial Americanisms, often hit its mark. He leaves an ineradicable electronic legacy, on CD and on the Web, and for those drawn to jihad, his death in an American missile strike may give his story a new gloss of martyrdom.","7719":"Everybody failed to predict the day, the place and the exact method of the 9/11 attacks, Pillar argues, not just the C.I.A. But the agency was far from failing to identify the danger posed by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, nor did it fail to organize a vigorous operation before the attacks, which included beefed-up funding of the Counterterrorism Center and the establishment of a special office targeting Al Qaeda. Among the numerous alarms issued in the summer of 2001 were specific warnings to the White House \u2014 to Bush\u2019s National Security Council adviser, Condoleezza Rice, in July and to the president himself in August. Rice argued later that the agency provided no \u201cactionable intelligence,\u201d so there was nothing to be done. But anyone who considers even cursorily the year of inflammatory warnings from the administration about Iraqi W.M.D.\u2019s, the planting of scare stories in the news media, the mobilization of military muscle and the escalating pressure on NATO allies, the United Nations and the United States Congress will note the rich menu of actions an aroused White House might have taken to meet the dangers posed by Al Qaeda.","772":"Visits to Tottenham and Finsbury Park today left unclear whether any of the groups were linked in any way to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 terror attacks, or whether the British authorities were simply keeping an eye on known groups considered extremist by the mainstream majority of Britain's 1.5 million Muslims.","7720":"Disillusioned by huge costs and uncertain outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Obama administration has decisively embraced the drone, along with small-scale lightning raids like the one that killed Osama bin Laden in May, as the future of the fight against terrorist networks.","7721":"It is a remarkable feature in the Arab world these days how little Al Qaeda actually comes up in conversations. Even before the eruption of revolts and revolutions, a group that bore some responsibility for two wars and deepening American involvement from North Africa to Iraq was losing its significance. When Osama bin Laden died, his killing seemed more an epitaph for another era. As is often remarked, the events of Sept. 11 seem a historical note to much of an Arab population where three in five are younger than 30.","7722":"9 A.M.

American and Pakistani officials have said that the doctor, Shakil Afridi, ran a vaccination program in Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was living, in an effort to obtain a DNA sample from him. Dr. Afridi was detained days after the American raid that killed Bin Laden by the Inter-Services Intelligence agency. The Pakistani commission investigating the raid said in a statement that that Dr. Afridi should be charged with \u201cconspiracy against the state of Pakistan and high treason\u201d on the basis of the evidence it had gathered.

In repeated appearances in court, Mr. Abdulmutallab, the well-educated son of a wealthy family, has almost seemed to have two personas: a polite, silent observer who appeared small at the defense table, and an unruly onlooker who would suddenly yell out messages of support for Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki, who was recently killed by a missile from an American drone. The American authorities have described him as a leading figure in a Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.","7741":"It is a relief that Mr. Obama will be the one to weigh the evidence and make the decisions, not his predecessor.

Panetta talked about his long career in Washington, his role as the C.I.A. director who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and the challenges confronting him as President Obama\u2019s new secretary of defense:","7775":"In a sign of how much importance the White House attaches to this strategy, Mr. Obama scarcely mentioned Iraq or Libya on his Western trip, dwelling on the problems of homeowners and middle-class families. When he did mention successes like the killing of Osama bin Laden, he did it almost in an \u201coh, by the way\u201d context.","7776":"In the months after the killing of Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil, talks were frozen, American intelligence officers were denied visas, and the administration accused the ISI of turning a blind eye to attacks on Americans launched from the country\u2019s tribal areas.","7777":"Osama bin Laden was thought to have been hiding in the tribal areas, too, said a tribal elder reached by telephone in the Haqqani stronghold of North Waziristan. Instead, Bin Laden was killed by American commandos in Abbottabad, a small city deep in Pakistan that is home to a top military academy. Whether he was there with the knowledge of Pakistan\u2019s spy agency is still unclear.","7778":"Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said earlier this year that he would try to prevent votes on measures that were not \u201csubstantive and meaningful.\u201d The House did not vote, for example, on an independent resolution, passed in the Senate this year, to honor the troops who carried out the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.","7779":"Such veneration weighed on Italy\u2019s leaders in 1945. After Mussolini was killed, a decision was made to obscure his grave site, much the way military officials in the Transitional National Council of Libya chose to bury Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in a secret location last month and American commandos buried Osama bin Laden at sea in May, to avoid creating a shrine for their supporters.","778":"Even if there were no such defiant fighters, waging war in that country would be a daunting business. The mountains soar to 20,000 feet in the east, and endless deserts lie in the west. Tracking down Osama bin Laden and finding Al Qaeda base camps in the forbidding recesses of the Hindu Kush will be difficult in the extreme.","7780":"First, Obama may have some untapped potential in highlighting his foreign-policy wins. The killing of Osama bin Laden did not produce a lasting bounce in the polls. But \u2014 sorry to be so gauche \u2014 killing the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist will make for a nice sound bite. Meanwhile, the NATO intervention in Libya reached a successful if bloody outcome, and the troops are coming home from Iraq. The White House has not done a good job of turning the discussion to foreign policy, and it has to be careful that in doing so it does not appear to be ignoring the economy. But foreign policy matters to voters, and Obama will have a marketing budget of hundreds of millions of dollars to get the message right.","7781":"Qaeda allies in North Africa, Somalia and Yemen are seeking to assert more influence after the death of Osama bin Laden and the diminished role of Al Qaeda\u2019s remaining top leadership in Pakistan. For its part, Al Qaeda in Iraq is striving to rebound from major defeats inflicted by Iraqi tribal groups and American troops in 2007, as well as the deaths of its two leaders in 2010.","7782":"Mr. Panetta outlined a series of guiding principles for where to invest and where to cut. He pledged to maintain and even increase spending in areas that have redefined the American way of war in recent years. They include cyberoffense and defense, unmanned aircraft, known as drones, and Special Operations forces \u2014 like those who killed Osama bin Laden and who also train foreign militaries to battle insurgencies so the United States does not have to.","7783":"In the interview with Lib\u00e9ration last month, Mr. Ram\u00edrez praised Osama bin Laden, whom he said he had never met, as a \u201csymbol of modern jihad.\u201d He also described the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a \u201csacrificial operation\u201d that \u201cproved to the imperialist Yankees that their territory was not out of reach.\u201d","7784":"\u2028\u2028Waheed also mentioned a story he reported with the Times\u2019s John F. Burns about a tall Afghan man the Americans killed because they suspected he was with a group of suspected Qaeda leaders.

So when the Navy Seals who raided the compound in May discovered a yellow brick in the compound\u2019s wall stamped \u201cA1,\u201d they knew what to do with it.","7788":"Mr. Daley helped oversee some successes, especially in foreign policy, such as the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and the American role in ousting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.","779":"Government officials also offered new details today about negotiations several years ago between the United States and Sudan in which the Sudanese government offered to turn over Osama bin Laden, who is reported to be the mastermind of last month's terror attacks.","7790":"While one student who spoke to Ms. Elmer said that she was motivated by her \u201clove for Joe Pa,\u201d using Mr. Paterno\u2019s nickname, another compared the rally to the campus celebrations the night Osama bin Laden was killed.

His voice boomed across the U.S.S. Carl Vinson, which has provided relief in Haiti after an earthquake, launched air strikes in the Middle East after Sept. 11 and dumped Osama bin Laden\u2019s body out at sea. Obama called that last action \u201cjustice,\u201d which drew a rousing ovation from the crowd, many clad in uniforms not of the basketball variety.","7793":"I say this \u2014 I say this nation has achieved its key objectives in\u00a0Afghanistan.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had free elections in 2004.\u00a0 We\u2019ve uprooted the\u00a0Taliban.\u00a0 We dismantled al-Qaeda.\u00a0 We have killed Osama bin Laden.\u00a0I say this nation\u2019s future is not Afghanistan.\u00a0 This nation\u2019s future is\u00a0not Iraq.\u00a0 This nation\u2019s future is how prepared we are to meet the 21st\u00a0Century challenges, that\u2019s economic and that\u2019s education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And that\u2019s\u00a0gonna play out over the Asia-Pacific region and we\u2019re either prepared for\u00a0that reality or we\u2019re not.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to be nation building in Afghanistan when this nation so\u00a0desperately needs to be built.\u00a0","7794":"ABOARD THE U.S.S.

The candidates differed on harsh interrogation techniques, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how to best deal with China. But the debate was a mostly civil affair, with little tension. Mr. Perry did not make any serious flubs, and even managed to make fun of himself by referencing the difficulty he had in the prior debate. The candidates will assemble in Washington, D.C., for another debate about foreign policy on Nov. 22. Stay tuned to The Caucus for further analysis of the debate and the rest of Campaign 2012. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:54 P.M.Paul and Rivals Differ on Interrogation Techniques The Republican candidates just avoided what could have been a contentious fight over harsh interrogation techniques. Asked repeatedly about whether it\u2019s acceptable for the government to use techniques like water-boarding to extract information from terrorism suspects, most of the candidates said it was. But after a while, Ron Paul had had enough. Mr. Paul said he opposes the use of harsh interrogation techniques and argued that the president should not have had the power to order the killing of an American citizen who was part of al Qaeda. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should give up so easily on our rule of law,\u201d Mr. Paul said. But his comments seemed to irk his colleagues. Mrs. Bachmann sounded the alarm, noting that Mr. Paul seemed to be suggesting that Mr. Obama should not have authorized the killing of Osama bin Laden. \u201cRon Paul doesn\u2019t think so. But this was a very good idea for the president,\u201d Mrs. Bachmann said. Mr. Perry seemed even more offended by Mr. Paul\u2019s suggestion. Puffing out his chest, Mr. Perry reminded the audience that he served in the Air Force and said that American soldiers are being killed at the hands of terrorists. \u201cFor us not to have the ability to try to extract information from them to save our young people\u2019s lives is a travesty,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is war. I am for using those techniques.\u201d Mr. Paul and his rivals might have continued the back and forth if they could, but the moderators were quick to move on to other subjects. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:37 P.M.Candidates Diverge on Military Action Against Iran The three Republican presidential candidates leading in the polls diverged on whether to take military action against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, in the wake of a report from United Nations weapons inspectors that the country has \u201ccarried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear device.\u201d Herman Cain said he would focus on using economic sanctions and aid to the Iranian opposition to pressure the Iranian government. But he said \u201cthe only way we can stop them is through economic means\u201d \u2014 a comment that suggested he does not believe that the United States should take military action to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear device. Mr. Cain also said that he would \u201cnot at this time\u201d entertain military assistance to the Iranian opposition. While Mitt Romney agreed with Mr. Cain about the need for economic sanctions and aiding Iranian opponents of the regime in Tehran, he also said that if nothing else worked, he would use the military. \u201cIf all else fails, if after all the work we\u2019ve done there\u2019s nothing else we can do besides take military action, then of course you take military action,\u201d he said. That appears to be the toughest language so far in this campaign about Iran\u2019s nuclear program from the former Massachusetts governor. A few days ago in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal he said that he would \u201cback up American diplomacy with a very real and very credible military option,\u201d but did not say that he would take definitely military action if there were no other options. Mr. Romney\u2019s response on Saturday night seemed more in line with remarks he made during the campaign four years ago in which he had advocated military action if other efforts failed to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear goals. \u201cIf for some reasons they continue down their course of folly toward nuclear ambition, then I would take military action if that\u2019s available to us,\u201d he said in 2007, adding that such action could be \u201ca number of options from blockade to bombardment of some kind.\u201d Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been rising in the polls, seemed to agree with Mr. Romney that if nothing else worked then the United States should take military action. If \u201cthe dictatorship persists,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said, \u201cyou have to take whatever steps are necessary to break its capacity to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d On the other hand, Representative Ron Paul of Texas was sharply critical of the idea of using force against Iran. He said that he fears that such action would be a repeat of the use of exaggerated and false threats that led to the Iraq war. \u201cI\u2019m afraid what\u2019s going on right now is similar to the war propaganda that went on against Iraq,\u201d he said. \u2014 RICHARD A. OPPEL JR. 9:31 P.M.Newt Gingrich, Mr. Congeniality Newt Gingrich relishes debates \u2014 they have been good for him \u2014 but when it comes to using the format to sharply distinguish his views, he would rather tangle with moderators than his rivals for the Republican nomination. Mr. Gingrich was Mr. Congeniality Saturday night, agreeing with his fellow Republicans on most issues. He also declined to repeat a criticism of Mr. Romney that he made yesterday when he condemned the former Massachusetts governor with faint praise as a \u201cgood manager.\u2019\u2019 \u201cIf you want to manage Washington,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Gingrich said Friday, \u201che\u2019d be a pretty good candidate,\u201d whereas he, Mr. Gingrich, stood for profound change. Asked tonight to elaborate, Mr. Gingrich declined to criticize Mr. Romney. \u201cWe\u2019re here tonight to talk to the American people about why every one of us is better than Barack Obama,\u2019\u2019 he said. Mr. Romney, he said, was \u201ca friend who is a great business manager.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 TRIP GABRIEL 9:27 P.M.Perry Offers Debate Spin on Israel Concerned a little about Israel? Mr. Perry\u2019s campaign sent out the following press release shortly after the Texas governor suggested that he would zero out aid to Israel and make the country prove they deserve American commitments. Gov. Perry on Israel As Gov. Perry said during the debate, \u201cObviously, Israel is a special ally, and my bet is that we would be funding them at some substantial level. But it makes sense for everyone to come in at zero and make your case.\u201d Gov. Perry is a friend to Israel and understands the challenges faced by the country. He has visited the country several times and has personal relationships with Israeli leaders. While in Israel in 2009, he was also awarded the Defender of Jerusalem Award. Gov. Perry recognizes Israel as a unique and vital political and economic partner for the United States in the Middle East. Our mutual commitment to democracy and free market principles makes us allies in the defense of western civilization. Gov. Perry understands Israel\u2019s security challenges, particularly the threat of Iran, and the need to work together to counter this threat. Especially after the most recent IAEA report on Iran\u2019s nuclear activity, we must not let any daylight show between our two nations. Gov. Perry understands the need to continue to work toward a solution to the Palestinian problem, but does not believe weakening Israel is the road to peace. A strong Israel is in the best interests of the United States and the region. Gov. Perry believes that the actions by the Palestinians to circumvent the appropriate diplomatic process and go directly to the United Nations to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood is unacceptable and a direct threat to our friend and ally, Israel. Under Rick Perry\u2019s presidency, any consideration of Palestinian statehood will depend upon a complete recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, the total rejection of terrorism and Palestinian leaders sitting down directly with Israel to negotiate a settlement. The aid and support of the United States will be based on the Palestinians meeting these requirements. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:05 P.M.Perry: Even Israel Starts from Zero on Foreign Aid Just in case you were wondering, Mr. Perry\u2019s warning that he would zero out foreign aid does apply to Israel. In answer to a Twitter question, Mr. Perry said that he expected Israel would end up qualifying for significant aid, but would start at zero if he were president. \u201cAbsolutely \u2014 every country would start at zero. Obviously, Israel is a special ally,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy in the world would our federal government get a pass on sending their tax dollars to any country.\u201d That could come back to haunt Mr. Perry in the Republican primary, where voters often demand that candidates demonstrate a strong commitment to Israel. They \u2014 and the Israelis \u2014 could feel offended by the idea that the country would have to demonstrate that it is deserving of the kind of aid it has been getting in the past. But Mr. Perry clearly believes that there is more political benefit to be had by demonstrating his fiscal chops by suggesting that he will cut foreign aid with a hatchet \u2014 something that many fiscal conservatives will probably like. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:44 P.M.A Tepid Response for Huntsman on Afghanistan Jon M. Huntsman Jr. received very little applause for his declaration that the United States should simply bring home its troops from Afghanistan. His position is far closer to that of many Democrats in Washington, and he drew only a tepid response from the mostly Republican audience in South Carolina. \u201cI say this nation\u2019s future is not Afghanistan. This nation\u2019s future is not Iraq,\u201d Mr. Huntsman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be nation building in Afghanistan when this nation needs so desperately to be rebuilt.\u201d Mr. Huntsman\u2019s views on the two wars America is waging puts him at odds with most of his rivals (Mr. Paul is the lone exception) and especially with Mr. Romney, who accuses Mr. Obama of not listening to the commanders in the field. Why doesn\u2019t Mr. Huntsman\u2019s position get more coverage, attention and criticism from conservatives? Perhaps his place in the polls \u2014 he remains very much near the bottom in most surveys \u2014 keeps him out of the line of fire. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:49 P.M.Perry Jokes About Debate Gaffe If there was a good way for Mr. Perry to deal with his forgetfulness from the last debate, this was it. Asked by moderator Scott Pelley about the Department of Energy, Mr. Perry interrupted. \u201cGlad you remembered it,\u201d Mr. Perry said, to applause from the audience. \u201cI\u2019ve had some time to think about it, sir,\u201d Mr. Pelley responded. \u201cMe, too,\u201d Mr. Perry said, smiling broadly and getting even bigger applause. Coming into the debate, Mr. Perry had to make sure that he didn\u2019t forget anything again. So far, he\u2019s avoided any further embarrassing moments \u2014 though his debate problems have tended to come after the first hour has gone. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:40 P.M.Perry Says He Would Zero-Out Foreign Aid Budget Mr. Perry suggested tonight that he would zero-out the foreign aid budget to all countries around the world, rethinking aid to friends and foes alike. The governor of Texas cited Afghanistan, Pakistan and India as examples of countries that would no longer get any money from the United States at the beginning of a Perry administration. He said countries would then be forced to prove that they deserve any money. \u201cThe foreign aid budget in my administration will start at zero dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cZero dollars. And then we\u2019ll have a conversation.\u201d Mr. Perry did not say whether he includes countries like Israel, England, France, Germany and other traditional allies. And some of his rivals challenged the idea that the United States would simply sever aid to places like Pakistan. Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Santorum both said the United States needs to continue aid and a strategic relationship with places like Pakistan, which has a nuclear weapon. \u201cWe must engage them as friends, get over the difficulties that we have,\u201d Mr. Santorum said. But Mr. Gingrich came to Mr. Perry\u2019s defense, saying that \u201cyou ought to start off at zero and say explain to me why I should give you a penny.\u201d \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:20 P.M.Candidates Critical of Obama on Iran If there was any hope among Democrats that Republicans were going to have a tougher time attacking President Obama on foreign policy than they have on the economy, the debate tonight might make them think again. Just moments after the debate began, the candidates started piling on Mr. Obama, accusing him of bungling the situation with Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. \u201cIf we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon,\u201d Mitt Romney charged. \u201cIf you elect me as president, Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.\u201d Newt Gingrich also slammed Mr. Obama, saying that his \u201cadministration skipped all the ways to be smart\u201d when it comes to Iran. Those included a failure to do covert operations or work with Israel. The answers suggest that the Republican candidates are not going to be cowed by the successes that Mr. Obama has had on the foreign policy front, including the killing of Osama bin Laden and other terrorist targets. And more criticism is likely ahead as the debate moves onto other issues, including the president\u2019s handling of the situation in the Middle East. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR","7797":"\u00a0Indeed, when word reached Ms. Raddatz on the night of Aug. 6 that 22 Navy Seals had been shot down in a transport helicopter that killed 30 Americans and 8 Afghans, including many Navy Seal commandos from the unit that had killed Osama bin Laden, she said she felt \u201cheartsick.\u201d","7798":"With the elimination of Osama bin Laden, the fall and death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and successful drone strikes against ranking figures in Al Qaeda, national security has become something of a strong point for Mr. Obama, robbing the Republicans of a traditional line of attack against Democrats.","7799":"The program\u2019s moderator, David Gregory, seemed perplexed: Lose the war on terror? Did she feel that way after Mr. Obama ordered the raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed or after he ordered a sharp acceleration in drone attacks against extremists?","78":"The Clinton administration added the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to a list of foreign terrorist organizations, saying it had strong ties to the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden. A3","780":"American intelligence has documented efforts by Osama bin Laden to acquire the means to build biological and chemical weapons, Mr. Cohen said. Terrorists might try to cause a contagion of anthrax or smallpox, Mr. Cohen said.","7803":"But Obama has dispatched more drones than Dick Cheney likely ever fantasized about, including the one that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen never given any trial. He ordered the mission that ended the life of Osama bin Laden. These aren\u2019t the actions of a commander in chief apologetic about the use of force. And they\u2019re proof that you can be plenty fearsome without whipping out the instruments of torture.","7804":"\u201cOsama bin Laden will never walk this earth again,\u201d Mr. Obama said to applause, adding, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been able to do it while sticking to our values.\u201d His statement countered several of the Republican presidential candidates who have said that they would reinstate waterboarding for terrorism suspects, a practice that Mr. Obama stopped, calling it torture.","7806":"Odd day. There were helicopters overhead during the night. That happened last for the marathon, and before that when they killed Osama bin Laden. (They\u2019ll be there Thanksgiving, for sure.) But I\u2019ve learned that if there\u2019s no big event scheduled it means Something Is Going On.","7808":"The hopeful news here for Mr. Obama is that his party is probably less vulnerable today on foreign policy and social issues than at any time since the 1960s. It was Mr. Obama, after all, who sent the Navy Seals in to kill Osama bin Laden. And on contentious cultural questions like gay rights and stem cell research, a new generation of voters, reared in a more tolerant and technological society, is rapidly changing the political calculus.","7810":"We will probably never get the full, true account of how Osama bin Laden was found and killed in Pakistan. Mr. Weisman\u2019s novelization of the mission is the next best thing. Having written fiction about the C.I.A. and the Navy Seals for two decades, he ably conjures how the president was persuaded to pull the trigger without confirmation that bin Laden was there; the moment the assault squad learns that its \u201chigh value target\u201d is Bin Laden; the disposal of the body. Since the event\u2019s outcome is known, this fleshed-out telling is more interesting than pulsating. Yet there is unexpected fun in Mr. Weisman\u2019s portrayals of barely cloaked real-life political figures. A certain \u201ccarefully coifed\u201d senator from Massachusetts mouths off to the cameras in Islamabad. The novel\u2019s hero? The Leon Panetta character, who, as the affable, straight-shooting head of the C.I.A., makes it all happen.","7811":"Mr. Ijaz described the memo, which he has not made public, as saying that the civilian government in Pakistan was seeking help in preventing a possible military coup in May. The military had just suffered humiliation over the American raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.","7812":"In recent months, Mr. Safavi and his teammates spotted posts that included doctored photographs of Osama bin Laden purporting to prove that Al Qaeda\u2019s leader had not died in an American commando raid. They turned up blogs stating that the Pentagon was accelerating war plans for invading many Muslim nations, and others amplifying Taliban accusations that American troops rape with impunity across Afghanistan.","7813":"As the home to Osama bin Laden in the years before the attacks, \u201cthe state of Afghanistan is one of the parties responsible for the murders of nearly 3,000 innocents on 9/11,\u201d said Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch.","7814":"Mr. Emanuel, who served as White House chief of staff for two years, ticked through a list of promises that Mr. Obama had delivered upon, including capturing and killing Osama bin Laden, withdrawing American troops from Iraq and overhauling the nation\u2019s health care system. He said he was guided by principle, not politics.","7816":"Citing a \u201cdangerous devolution\u201d of security in Pakistan after the killing of Osama bin Laden, and the possibility of a military coup, the memo asked the United States for \u201cdirect intervention in conveying a strong, urgent and direct message\u201d to the military, demanding that it end its \u201cbrinkmanship.\u201d","7817":"Only one recent example comes to mind of a president personally supervising a military operation: the assassination of Osama bin Laden.

Though he does not offer a substitute measure, he maintains that the evidence against Mr. bin Laden is 'pretty good information.' Regardless of the forum and regardless of the analytic prism employed, we should insist on much more than 'pretty good information' before killing Mr. bin Laden, his associates and, inevitably, innocent civilians. 'Beyond a reasonable doubt' fits the bill.","7820":"10:38 P.M.That\u2019s a Wrap The debate is over and the candidates have gone home. The Caucus live blog has ended, too.

Mary, Garden City, N.Y. In his answer on immigration, Mr. Perry said Mexico was in danger of becoming a staging ground for terrorist attacks on the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing countries start to come in and infiltrate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that Hamas and Hezbollah are working in Mexico, as well as Iran, with their ploy to come into the United States.\u201d Mr. Perry was referring to what American prosecutors have called a recent plot by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to assassinate Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, a plot that would have used hitmen from a Mexican drug cartel. Hamas and Hezbollah are supported by Iran and sometimes seen as proxies for Tehran. But according to a 2010 State Department report, Mexico is not a staging ground for any terrorist group targeting the United States. \u2014 MARK LANDLER 10:31 P.M.Fact Check: Abortions in China The debate had relatively few rhetorical blasts against China, perhaps because President Obama just returned from an Asian tour in which he announced a muscular new policy toward Beijing. In his closing statement, however, Rick Perry cited the rise of China as the greatest national-security threat to the United States. He repeated his prediction that \u201cCommunist China\u201d will end up on the ash heap of history because it is a country lacking principles. As evidence, he cited China\u2019s hacking of computers and alleged that in China, there are 35,000 forced abortions a day. That number has been cited by some human rights activists, who say that because of China\u2019s one-child policy, families often screen for the gender of unborn children and then abort those who are female. In 2011, the Guttmacher Institute estimated that there were nine million abortions in China \u2014 or a rate of about 25,000 a day. \u2014 MARK LANDLER 10:16 P.M.Fact Check: Syria, Oil and No-Fly Zones does Syria have a lot of oil?? @teenagepundit, via Twitter The Republican candidates split over the issue of whether to implement a no-fly zone over Syria to protect opponents of the regime there. Mr. Perry pushed that idea as a serious option, saying that if \u201cwe are serious about Iran, we have to be serious about Syria as well.\u201d But Mr. Cain said he would not support a no-fly zone, arguing that it is better to use economic sanctions \u2014 like working with American allies to stop buying Syrian oil. But it is not clear that such sanctions would really affect the volume or value of Syrian exports, since there are plenty of other countries that would buy its petroleum. (For the record, according to the C.I.A., Syria produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day, and exported about two-thirds of that as of 2009.) Mr. Romney agreed with Mr. Cain, saying, \u201cThis is not the right time\u201d for a no-fly zone over Syria. He said he favored sanctions and covert actions to deal with the country\u2019s regime. \u2014 RICHARD A. OPPEL JR. 10:02 P.M.An Array of Responses to \u2018Biggest Threat?\u2019 What is the biggest threat no one is talking about? An interesting question for all of the candidates: Mr. Santorum: South and Central America. Mr. Paul: Overreaction. Mr. Perry: China. Mr. Romney: Latin America. Mr. Cain: Cyberattacks. Mr. Gingrich: Electromagnetic pulse attacks, a nuclear weapon in an American city, cyberattacks. Mrs. Bachmann: Losing the peace in Iraq. Mr. Huntsman: Debt. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:55 P.M.Fact Check: No Apology Mr. Romney again repeated the familiar Republican charge that President Obama has apologized for the United States around the world. Here\u2019s what we wrote in September about this statement : It is true that early in his term, Mr. Obama promised to abandon policies of his predecessor, George W. Bush, on issues like the military prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and a foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere that Mr. Obama described as unilateral. But it is hard to find evidence that Mr. Obama ever said he was \u201csorry\u201d for the United States. And in some speeches, notably after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Obama offered a robust defense of American policies, including the war in Afghanistan. \u2014 THE NEW YORK TIMES 9:51 P.M.A Temporary Peace Between Romney and Perry? It looked as if Mr. Perry was looking for another clash with Mr. Romney \u2014 or maybe just expecting one. After Mr. Romney mentioned immigration \u201cmagnets\u201d and mentioned in-state tuition programs like the one Mr. Perry backed in Texas, Mr. Perry took note. \u201cHere we go again, Mitt,\u201d said Mr. Perry, perhaps bracing for another back-and-forth over the issue. But the clash never came. Mr. Perry declined to go after Mr. Romney\u2019s hiring of illegal immigrants to work on his yard. And Mr. Romney did not specifically go after the Texas program Mr. Perry supported. Maybe a bit of detente? \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:49 P.M.More Camera Time for Ron Paul Mr. Paul, whose campaign claimed after the last debate hosted by CBS News that he got only 90 seconds of air time, is playing a more central role tonight, and he is serving as a dramatic foil to his rivals. On foreign policy, his views are even farther from those of his Republican rivals than from the views of President Obama and other Democrats. Mr. Paul calls his foreign policy position non-interventionist. To outsiders, it can sound isolationist. He believes that all of the country\u2019s military engagements since World War II have been illegal and morally wrong. Mr. Paul, who in recent polls in Iowa has emerged in a statistical tie for the lead, clashed with Mr. Gingrich over the the Patriot Act, which is designed to prevent terrorist attacks. Mr. Gingrich would strengthen it. Mr. Paul called it \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and said that tightening surveillance of suspects was a step toward a \u201cpolice state.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Paul also clashed with Mr. Santorum, who said he favored ethnic and religious profiling of travelers, including Muslims. Mr. Paul\u2019s response: \u201cThat\u2019s digging a hole for ourselves. What if they look like Timothy McVeigh?,\u2019\u2019 a reference to the American-born Oklahoma City bomber. And Mr. Paul, expressing support for medical marijuana, said the drug war is \u201canother war we ought to cancel.\u2019\u2019 For viewers unfamiliar with Mr. Paul, he is giving them a glimpse of what a libertarian sounds like. \u2014 TRIP GABRIEL 9:45 P.M.Gingrich Offers Risky Position on Immigration The political dangers of the immigration question are lurking again in a Republican debate. Mr. Gingrich said he supported finding a way to allow the millions of illegal immigrants to stay in this country legally \u2014 without granting amnesty. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to take the heat for saying, \u2018Let\u2019s be humane about enforcing the law,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gingrich said. He may well take the heat. That position was immediately jumped on by Mr. Romney and Mrs. Bachmann, both of whom decried it as amnesty, no matter what Mr. Gingrich calls it. In an earlier debate, Rick Perry angered many conservatives by standing behind his policy of giving in-state tuition breaks to illegal immigrants and saying that anyone who didn\u2019t support that didn\u2019t \u201chave a heart.\u201d Now, Newt Gingrich \u2014 leading in the polls \u2014 is wading into the same waters. And if history is any guide, Mr. Gingrich might find himself at odds with conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina with that position. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:34 P.M.A Simple Fix for Immigration From Cain An appealing trait of Herman Cain is his plain-spokenness. One example is his very simple plan for solving the immigration problem, at least as it relates to Mexico. 1. \u201cSecure the border for real.\u201d 2. \u201cEnforce the laws that are there.\u201d 3. \u201cFix the immigration system.\u201d 4. \u201cEmpower the states.\u201d Easy. Mr. Cain did not elaborate about how he would accomplish any of those things, but stated them all very simply. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:29 P.M.Fact Check: Romney on Obama and Israel Mitt Romney implied that the Obama administration had not shown that it cares about Israel. The \u201cright course,\u201d Mr. Romney said, is to \u201cshow that we care about Israel, that they are our friend \u2014 we\u2019ll stick with them.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m president of the United States, my first foreign trip will be to Israel to show the world we care about that country and that region,\u201d he said. Mr. Romney and other G.O.P. candidates have argued during the campaign that Mr. Obama has turned his back on Israel, or even, as Mr. Romney has said, thrown it under a bus. Politically, the candidates are eager to attract political and financial support from Jewish voters and donors, traditionally a strong base of support for Democrats. They are also competing to woo evangelical voters in the Republican Party who view unwavering support for Israel as a critical position. But criticism that the Obama administration has neglected Israel ignores a lot. For example, the current Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, has stoutly praised Mr. Obama and his commitment to Israel\u2019s security. Certainly, Mr. Obama has had differences with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu: He was overheard several weeks ago appearing to sympathize with a comment by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who said in a private conversation that Mr. Netanyahu was a \u201cliar.\u201d And many Republicans, including Mr. Romney, have attacked Mr. Obama for saying during a speech in May that the \u201cborders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed-upon swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.\u201d That was a shift \u2013 albeit subtle \u2013 in policy, many analysts said, in publicly endorsing using the borders before the 1967 war as a starting point for talks on a two-state solution. But the language was not extraordinary, as other administrations have pursued a deal between the two sides using the same borders, with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, as a basis for talks. And while Mr. Netanyahu sharply criticized that speech, Mr. Obama has firmly taken Israel\u2019s side on a number of disputes, like vigorously opposing efforts to win recognition for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. Nor is it clear how many Israelis have misgivings about Mr. Obama. For example, Mr. Barak, a former prime minister who is also the most decorated soldier in the country\u2019s history, told CNN a few days ago that Mr. Obama had been an \u201cextremely strong supporter of Israel in regard to its security.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone can raise any question mark about the devotion of this president to the security of Israel,\u201d Mr. Barak added. \u2014 RICHARD A. OPPEL JR. 9:23 P.M.Perry Calls for Panetta\u2019s Resignation in Face of Cuts It wouldn\u2019t be a Republican debate without a call for the resignation of an official in the Obama administration. Enter Mr. Perry, who called on Leon Panetta, the secretary of defense, to resign rather than submit to automatic cuts in the defense budget. Mr. Panetta is generally well-liked in Washington, even among Republicans. He was easily confirmed for the defense post after leading the C.I.A. during the period when Osama bin Laden was found and killed. But Mr. Perry seemed unmoved by his reputation, saying that resigning would be the honorable thing to do in the face of deep cuts at the Pentagon. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:21 P.M.Fact Check: Perry on Aid to Pakistan Mr. Perry asserted that the United States sends a blank check, with no strings attached, to Pakistan. But this year, the Obama administration is suspending and in some cases canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Pakistani military, in large part to chasten it for expelling American military trainers and failing to fight militants effectively. Altogether, about $800 million in military aid and equipment \u2014 or more than one-third of the $2 billion the United States sends annually in security assistance to Pakistan \u2014 could be affected. The aid includes about $300 million to reimburse Pakistan for the costs of deploying more than 100,000 soldiers on its border with Afghanistan to combat terrorism. \u2014 ELISABETH BUMILLER 9:19 P.M.A Chilean Model for Social Security Reform Newt Gingrich and the other Republicans often criticize President Obama for basing his philosophy on what they call a European socialism. So what is Mr. Gingrich\u2019s model for reform of the American entitlement system? How about the South American country of Chile? He says that its use of personal accounts for retirement should be the basis of Social Security reform in this country. And just in case anyone accuses him of internationalism, Mr. Gingrich adds that he also likes a domestic model: Galveston, Tex. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:13 P.M.Reining In Gas Prices Buck-a-gallon gas? Mr. Gingrich did not exactly promise that. But he suggested that the country was not doing what it could to curb steadily rising prices at the pump. \u201cIf we were serious, we would open up enough oil fields in the next year that the price of oil would collapse,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we would do if we were serious.\u201d He didn\u2019t say what exactly that means, or where he would drill. And he didn\u2019t confront questions about how fast \u2014 or not \u2014 the oil companies could actually make use of those oil fields. But he called the bureaucracy in Washington \u201cmindless\u201d and said the government was standing in the way of much lower gas prices. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:11 P.M.The Intricacies of Iran Sanctions How to deal with Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions got the candidates into the weeds of American sanctions law. Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and other candidates called for the United States to impose formal sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank. The Obama administration stopped short of that step in announcing new Iran sanctions on Monday. The reason is that formal sanctions would require the United States to cut off any foreign institution that does business with the central bank. China, Japan and South Korea all buy oil from Iran, processing those transactions through the central bank, and they are not likely to stop because of American sanctions. That would put the administration in the untenable position of cutting off the Bank of China and the Bank of Japan. \u2014 MARK LANDLER 9:08 P.M.Fact Check: Israel and Iran Mr. Paul is correct in saying that the recently retired head of Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency has been highly critical of the idea of launching a pre-emptive strike against Iran, comments that have highlighted the sharp debate within Israel over using a military option to slow Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Meir Dagan, who was in charge of Mossad until last January, said this summer that attacking Iran would be a \u201cstupid idea.\u201d He later added that it would bring \u201cregional war.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d he said, \u201cyou would have given Iran the best possible reason to continue the nuclear program.\u201d \u2014 RICHARD A. OPPEL JR. 9:09 P.M.Continuing Humanitarian Aid to Africa Should America continue to provide humanitarian aid to Africa, under programs that were expanded under the presidency of George W. Bush? Rick Santorum says yes. \u201cI hear people up here talking about zeroing out foreign aid,\u201d he said, calling that \u201cabsolutely the wrong course.\u201d But Mr. Paul disagrees. He said that giving aid to places like Africa is \u201cworthless,\u201d and that the only thing that should be exported is American principles. And Herman Cain said he\u2019s not sure: \u201cIt depends upon priorities. It depends upon looking at the program and asking: \u2018Has that money been worthwhile? I would like to see the results.\u2019 \u201c \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 9:07 P.M.Fact Check: Obama, the C.I.A. and the A.C.L.U. Can you fact-check Bachmann\u2019s accusation of the C.I.A. and A.C.L.U.? @naeemac, via Twitter Mrs. Bachmann, who sits on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, asserted that President Obama \u201chas essentially handed over our interrogation of terrorists to the A.C.L.U.\u2019\u2019 She said the C.I.A. \u201chas no ability to have any form of interrogation for terrorists,\u201d and gave as an example the so-called underwear bomber, who, after he was apprehended for trying to blow up a plane scheduled to land in Detroit, \u201cwas given Miranda warnings within 45 minutes.\u2019\u2019 The first part of Mrs. Bachmann\u2019s statement was apparently a reference to President Obama\u2019s executive order shortly after his inauguration ordering the C.I.A.\u2019s controversial \u201cblack site\u201d prisons abroad shut down. However, according to news accounts, the C.I.A. continues to interrogate terrorism suspects abroad, including Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali accused of ties to Islamist militant groups, who was questioned for months aboard a United States naval vessel before being flown to New York this summer for trial. As for Mrs. Bachmann\u2019s second statement, about the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was pulled off a jet in Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009, Mr. Abdulmutallab claimed in court that he had not been read his Miranda rights before being questioned in a hospital. An F.B.I. agent confirmed this account. Mr. Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty to all charges last month. \u2014 TRIP GABRIEL 9:02 P.M. Fact Check: My Name Is \u2026 Romney says Mitt is his first name. Isn\u2019t it Willard? Elliot, Cornwall, N.Y. After the debate moderator, Wolf Blitzer, opened the program by giving a sample introduction \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m Wolf Blitzer, and yes, that is my real name,\u201d he said \u2014 and urging the candidates to do the same, Mitt Romney used his turn to make a joke. \u201cI\u2019m Mitt Romney and yes, Wolf, that\u2019s also my first name,\u201d he said. But that\u2019s not quite the case. In fact, Mr. Romney\u2019s full name is Willard Mitt Romney \u2014 making his first name Willard, not Mitt. He was named after J. Willard Marriott, the founder of the Marriott Hotel chain, and a close friend of Mr. Romney\u2019s father. (On internal campaign memos, he\u2019s frequently referred to by his initials \u2014 W.M.R.). However, Mr. Romney goes by Mitt, and that\u2019s what his friends and staffers often call him. (Aides also call him \u201cthe Gov,\u201d referring to his time as the governor of Massachusetts.) So, our final verdict: technically false, but basically true. \u2014 ASHLEY PARKER 8:58 P.M.Fact Check: Violence in Afghanistan Violence is down in Afghanistan, according to the United States military, but aid groups disagree. There is no question that insurgents have been set back in the Taliban heartland of Helmand and Kandahar Provinces in southern Afghanistan, where there are tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines. The question is what happens after America leaves. \u2014 ELISABETH BUMILLER 8:58 P.M.Paul Breaks From Candidates and Dismisses Israel Many of the Republican candidates have jumped all over Mr. Obama for not being sufficiently supportive of Israel. But one of their own \u2014 Mr. Paul \u2014 goes much farther in dismissing Israel. \u201cI think they are quite capable of taking care of themselves,\u201d Mr. Paul said, noting that he would not help Israel in a pre-emptive attack against Iran and its nuclear weapons program. And yet, Mr. Paul\u2019s fellow candidates \u2014 while disagreeing with him \u2014 did not jump all over him the way they have Mr. Obama. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:51 P.M.Fact Check: How Big Is Pakistan? Gov. Romney just said that Pakistan is 6th largest country \u2014 based on what? asulaw, Phoenix According to the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s World Factbook, the population of Pakistan makes it the sixth-largest country in the world, placing it between Brazil and Bangladesh. Its estimated population as of July 2011 was 187,342,721. So Mr. Romney is correct. \u2014 RICHARD A. OPPEL JR. 8:48 P.M.Huntsman and Romney Clash on Afghanistan The fight between Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Romney over Afghanistan has been brewing for some time, and seemed ready to spill over tonight. Mr. Huntsman is steadfast in his belief that most American troops should come back sooner than Mr. Obama has decreed, while Mr. Romney is insistent that troops should stay longer. Mr. Huntsman chided Mr. Romney for his repeated claim that he would listen to the commanders on the ground, saying that a president is commander in chief, and \u201cought to be informed by a lot of different voices.\u201d Mr. Romney shot back, \u201cThe commander in chief makes that decision based on input from people who are closest to the ground.\u201d Neither noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s decisions regarding Afghanistan were preceded by months and months of closed-door meetings and discussions with the generals that Mr. Romney cites so often. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:39 P.M.Bachmann Calls Pakistan \u2018Too Nuclear to Fail\u2019 Mrs. Bachmann scolded Mr. Perry for suggesting that the United States should simply stop writing checks to Pakistan, saying the country is \u201ctoo nuclear to fail.\u201d Mr. Perry repeated his pledge that as president he would end aid to countries that do not support America. \u201cTo write a check to countries that are clearly not representing American interests is nonsensical,\u201d Mr. Perry said. Mrs. Bachmann\u2019s responded, \u201cWith all due respect to the governor, I think that\u2019s highly na\u00efve.\u201d \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:34 P.M.A Still-Twirling Cain Stumbles on Blitzer\u2019s Name Herman Cain apparently still has a lot twirling around in his head. During an answer about racial profiling, Mr. Cain disputed the premise of the moderator, Wolf Blitzer, who had asked whether Muslim Americans should be subjected to extra screening at airports. \u201cNo, Blitz, that\u2019s oversimplifying it,\u201d Mr. Cain said. He caught his mistake a moment later, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Blitz. I meant Wolf,\u201d and then adding: \u201cSince we\u2019re in a Blitz debate. Sorry, Wolf.\u201d It was just days ago that Mr. Cain stumbled through an answer about Libya during an editorial board meeting. The problem, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got all this stuff twirling around in my head.\u201d \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:27 P.M.Perry Accuses Obama of Intelligence Failures Rick Perry said the Obama administration had been an \u201cabsolute failure\u201d in collecting intelligence that could stop terrorism, apparently ignoring the administration\u2019s success against terrorism. \u201cThis administration in particular has been an absolute failure,\u201d he said, in spending money to \u201cbe able to draw in that intelligence\u201d that will stop terrorist acts. Mr. Obama, of course, ordered the assault that killed Osama bin Laden based on intelligence collected by the C.I.A. and other government agencies. The government also recently killed other terror leaders based on intelligence gathered during Mr. Obama\u2019s term. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:23 P.M.Different Views on the Patriot Act Two strains of conservative thought about security were on display early tonight on a question about the Patriot Act, offered up by Ed Meese, the attorney general under Ronald Reagan. Newt Gingrich said he was all for strengthening the act, saying, \u201cI think you want to use every tool you can possibly use.\u201d Ron Paul disagreed, warning: \u201cYou can prevent crimes by becoming a police state. You might prevent a crime. But the crime then will be against the American people.\u201d Michele Bachmann sided with Mr. Gingrich; Jon Huntsman sided \u2014 basically \u2014 with Mr. Paul, saying that America should remember that \u201cwe are a nation of values.\u201d \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:13 P.M.A Promise of Fairness From Wolf Blitzer Wolf Blitzer made a pre-emptive strike against Jon M. Huntsman Jr., Michele Bachmann and some of their rivals, who have often complained about not getting enough attention. \u201cCandidates, I\u2019ll try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions,\u201d he said. Mr. Huntsman and other candidates who are low in the polls have complained during other debates that they were treated unfairly. Mrs. Bachmann criticized CBS News after an e-mail surfaced suggesting that she might not get that many questions during a debate hosted by the network. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 8:05 P.M.A Flashy Opening From CNN The debate is under way, and CNN has decided to go grim for the intro: grainy black-and-white pictures of men at war and videos of presidents dealing with crises. This is the year of the flashy openers for debates, which have taken cues from ball games \u2014 grab your audiences and ratings will soar. So far, it\u2019s working. The debates have had the best ratings ever. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR 6:36 P.M.All Eyes on Gingrich The eight Republican candidates for president will take the stage in Washington\u00a0 tonight at 8, but all eyes will be on Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. Mr. Gingrich has swiftly risen in national polls in recent days, becoming the current threat to Mitt Romney\u2019s hopes of winning his party\u2019s nomination. Debates have been Mr. Gingrich\u2019s strength, and his campaign is hoping to use tonight\u2019s face-off to help cement the idea that he has the best ideas for the country, especially when it comes to national security, the focus of the debate. Mr. Romney is likely to try to keep the focus on President Obama on the day he unveiled his first attack ad. Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, and Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, are hoping to jump-start their campaigns after flubs that have cost them support in the polls. The debate will be broadcast on CNN. We\u2019ll be providing real-time analysis and fact-checking on our debate dashboard and also taking suggestions from readers for candidate statements that deserve a closer look. You can submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #asknyt or on the dashboard. \u2014 MICHAEL D. SHEAR","7821":"MR. HUNTSMAN AND RON PAUL Both urged caution in strengthening the Patriot Act, favored by Mrs. Bachmann and Mr. Gingrich, saying that civil liberties have been subordinated to the search for terrorists. \u201cYou can still provide security without sacrificing our Bill of Rights,\u201d Mr. Paul said, drawing the scorn of Mrs. Bachmann, who said the Obama administration has already outsourced the interrogation of terrorists to the A.C.L.U. (Does that include killing Osama bin Laden and securing a conviction of the would-be Christmas Day underwear bomber?)","7822":"In Washington, American officials were scrambling to assess what had happened amid preliminary reports that allied forces in Afghanistan engaged in a firefight along the border and called in airstrikes. Senior Obama administration officials were also weighing the implications on a relationship that took a sharp turn for the worse after a Navy Seal commando raid killed Osama bin Laden near Islamabad in May, and that has deteriorated since then.","7823":"The president\u2019s aides believe that they can promote the benefits of his health care law. Mr. Obama has already been doing that on the stump, noting that \u201can insurance company can\u2019t reject you because you\u2019ve got a pre-existing condition.\u201d (The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to take up a challenge to the law creates something of a political jump ball, strategists with both parties say.) Team Obama also plans to promote the success of the automobile bailout, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the winding down of the war in Iraq.","7824":"The relationship between the United States and Pakistan, already damaged last winter when a C.I.A. contractor killed two Pakistanis, plummeted after the cross-border mission that killed Osama bin Laden in May.","7825":"The question now, as one senior American official put it on Sunday, is \u201cwhat kind of resilience is left\u201d in a relationship that has sunk to new lows time after time this year \u2014 with the arrest in January of a C.I.A. officer, Raymond Davis, the killing of Osama bin Laden in May and the deaths of so many Pakistani soldiers.","7826":"America\u2019s strained ties with Pakistan have been buffeted by crises this year, from the killing of two Pakistanis by a C.I.A. contractor to the raid inside Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.","7827":"The Marine Corps also has begun using specially trained dogs to track Taliban fighters and bomb-makers. And Special Operations commandos train their own dogs to accompany elite teams on secret missions like the Navy SEAL raid that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Across all the forces, more than 50 military dogs have been killed since 2005.","7828":"AMERICA\u2019S relations with Pakistan have been steadily deteriorating ever since a Navy Seals team killed Osama bin Laden near Islamabad in May. Matters became still worse in September, when Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accused Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency of supporting an attack on the American Embassy in Kabul. And on Saturday, the relationship hit a new low when a NATO airstrike mistakenly killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers, and Pakistan retaliated by shutting down supply routes to Afghanistan that crossed its territory.","7829":"Mr. Zawahri, who took over the leadership of Al Qaeda after the killing in May of Osama bin Laden, mentioned Mr. Weinstein in a half-hour video released to militant forums on the Web, the eighth in a series of talks responding to events in Mr. Zawahri\u2019s native Egypt. He drew an analogy with Israel\u2019s release of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in return for the release by Hamas of a captured Israel soldier, Gilad Shalit.","783":"PARIS, Oct. 3\u2014 A young Frenchman of Algerian background, extradited here from Britain over the weekend, today was ordered held and placed under formal investigation, becoming the ninth suspect in a case that may link Osama bin Laden with a plot to blow up the United States Embassy in Paris, French officials and newspapers reported.","7830":"On the other side is Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a onetime mentor to Osama bin Laden who was named a \u201cspecially designated global terrorist\u201d by the United States Treasury Department in 2004. Mr. Zindani is the most the prominent leader of the old-guard camp that many Yemeni observers say still holds sway in the party, despite assertions by moderates that they are becoming more influential.","7831":"Previous cross-border strikes were investigated jointly and the fallout quickly contained, like the dispute that followed the American helicopter attacks on Pakistani forces in September 2010. But a year of crises that began with an American contractor shooting two Pakistanis to death on a street in Lahore and included the Navy Seal raid northwest of Islamabad that killed Osama bin Laden, now risks ending with the breach of an alliance that has been the cornerstone of American national security policy for the past decade, American officials and analysts said.","7832":"At bottom the apology trope \u2014 and Republican exploitation of it \u2014 arises not from metaphysical principles or historical interpretation, but from politics. Having killed Osama bin Laden and wound down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the president is not terribly vulnerable on foreign policy. The goal of critics is thus to discredit Mr. Obama himself. If Mr. Obama does not believe in America, how can any of his policies be trusted?","7833":"South Asia specialists said that Mr. Obama\u2019s telephone conversation, along with a call that Mrs. Clinton made to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani on Saturday, could help patch up the relationship, which had been strained this year by the killing of two Pakistanis in Lahore by an American contractor and by the Navy Seals raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","7834":"And you also have to denounce President Obama, who enacted a Republican-designed health reform and killed Osama bin Laden, as a radical socialist who is undermining American security.","7838":"But attacking the Obama administration on foreign policy may prove challenging. The administration can point to the overthrow of Muammar el-Qaddafi, its efforts opposing United Nations recognition for Palestinian statehood, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the weakening of Al Qaeda on the Afghan-Pakistani border.","7839":"In his May 2011 announcement of Osama Bin Laden\u2019s death, President Obama compared the events of September 11, 2001, with Pearl Harbor: \u201cNearly 10 years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor. This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security \u2026\u201d","784":"With the Taliban leaders refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden, named by the United States as the 'prime suspect' in the attacks, many within the Taliban's ranks appear to have concluded that war with the United States is inevitable.","7841":"They also point to the killing of Osama bin Laden and the decimation of Al Qaeda\u2019s ranks in the Pakistani frontier through an accelerated program of drone-fired missile strikes as evidence of the administration\u2019s commitment to battling Islamists who are a threat to the United States.","7843":"Iran said over the weekend that it had recovered the RQ-170, the same drone deployed over Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound before he was killed in May. Senior intelligence officials were disturbed that the drone was publicly discussed in the coverage of the Bin Laden raid, in part because of the fear of exposing its use over Iran.","7844":"Allies of the Obama administration, which enjoys healthy public support for its record on terrorism and national security, also cite its high levels of military assistance to Israel and resistance at the United Nations to the Palestinians\u2019 efforts to win statehood recognition. They also point to national security successes under Mr. Obama\u2019s leadership, like the killing of Osama bin Laden and the decimation of Al Qaeda\u2019s ranks in the Pakistani frontier by drone strikes.","7845":"Twitter and Facebook released similar lists of the topics and news events that caught fire among users during the year. Twitter cited the revolts in Egypt and the very public meltdown of the actor Charlie Sheen, while on Facebook, the death of Osama bin Laden and the Super Bowl were among the most popular items.","7846":"American officials have identified the missing drone as an RQ-170 Sentinel, an unarmed bat-winged aircraft used by the C.I.A. It can linger undetected for hours at 50,000 feet, far higher than many aircraft, with cameras and other sensor equipment to monitor activity on the ground. An RQ-170 was used to gather intelligence for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May.","7847":"\u201cAsk Osama bin Laden and the 22 out of top 30 Al Qaeda leaders who have been taken off the field whether I engage in appeasement \u2014 or whoever\u2019s left out there, ask them about that,\u201d the president said.","7848":"\u201cAsk Osama bin Laden and the 22 out of 30 top Al Qaeda leaders who\u2019ve been taken off the field whether I engage in appeasement,\u201d the president declared. \u201cOr whoever\u2019s left out there, ask them about that.\u201d","7849":"After he ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, there was no victory dance. He refused to release the bloody photographs of bin Laden\u2019s body, and when he brought it up, he generally deferred credit to \u201cthe extraordinary bravery of the men and women who wear this nation\u2019s uniform and the outstanding work of our intelligence agencies.\u201d","785":"Pakistan's most important contribution may be intelligence. Along with Russia and Egypt, and to a lesser degree China, it is believed to have the best data about Osama bin Laden.","7850":"After he ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, there was no victory dance. He refused to release the bloody photographs of bin Laden\u2019s body, and when he brought it up, he generally deferred credit to \u201cthe extraordinary bravery of the men and women who wear this nation\u2019s uniform and the outstanding work of our intelligence agencies.\u201d","7851":"Yes, him. Parallels between the malefactors of fantasy and their real-life counterparts are always suggestive, even if the alignment is never exact. Osama bin Laden and the demonic artist formerly known as Tom Riddle were both wayward sons of privilege, but the convergence of their careers is simply a historical accident, or perhaps an example of the kind of serendipity that takes on significance only in hindsight. Bin Laden was active in the early and mid-\u201990s, before J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter novels became a global sensation, but Bin Laden himself only achieved that status with the Sept. 11 attacks, which occurred two months before the release of \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone,\u201d the first of eight feature films.","7852":"And in August, reports attributed to American intelligence officials asserted that Pakistan had allowed Chinese experts to inspect the remains of the stealth helicopter that crashed during the May mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Although Pakistan and China denied the reports, Beijing would have a great interest in examining the tail of the Black Hawk helicopter, the part of the aircraft that was not destroyed by the Navy Seals team, to learn more secret details of American stealth technology.","7853":"While United States officials do not comment publicly on drone operations against militants who plan attacks on Afghanistan from havens in the Pakistani tribal areas, operations had been reduced at the Shamsi air base since May, when a Navy Seal commando raid killed Osama bin Laden near Islamabad. The United States also carries out drone strikes from bases in Afghanistan.","7856":"One provision would authorize the military to indefinitely detain without charge people suspected of involvement with terrorism, including United States citizens apprehended on American soil. Due process would be a thing of the past. Some claim that this provision would merely codify existing practice. Current law empowers the military to detain people caught on the battlefield, but this provision would expand the battlefield to include the United States \u2014 and hand Osama bin Laden an unearned victory long after his well-earned demise.","7857":"Later, however, I saw from inside the White House how George W. Bush\u2019s refusal to perform civilian oversight of the invasion plan for Afghanistan resulted in Gen. Tommy Franks conducting an operation in which the capture of Osama bin Laden was not a primary objective. Thus, the terrorist leader responsible for the largest attack in the United States in history was able to continue to operate for another decade.","7858":"He said that the analysis also looked at the most shared events in 2011. It showed that 20 percent of shares using AddThis were about Osama bin Laden and took place on May 1, the day he was killed, and May 2.","786":"It was unclear last night why in the days after Mr. Al-Angari's arrest, a law enforcement official said privately that he appeared to have ties to a brother of Osama bin Laden, the man President Bush has said is the prime suspect behind the attacks.","7860":"Because of you, in Afghanistan we\u2019ve broken the momentum of the Taliban.\u00a0 Because of you, we\u2019ve begun a transition to the Afghans that will allow us to bring our troops home from there.\u00a0 And around the globe, as we draw down in Iraq, we have gone after al Qaeda so that terrorists who threaten America will have no safe haven, and Osama bin Laden will never again walk the face of this Earth.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0","7862":"The Republican candidates have had a very difficult time with foreign affairs this season. You had Herman Cain\u2019s Libya moment. Rick Perry tried claiming that as president he\u2019d zero-base budget all foreign aid and then ran into the Israel buzz saw, exempted \u201cstrategic aid in all forms\u201d and appeared to wind up saying that he would take a hard-eyed look at any spending overseas that involved aid to hungry children. And then Obama batted back Romney\u2019s \u201cappeasement\u201d critique by telling them to \u201cask Osama bin Laden.\u201d So now we\u2019re down to Honduras in 2009.","7863":"9 P.M. (ABC) THE YEAR WITH KATIE COURIC Ms. Couric, left, looks back at events of 2011, including the death of Osama bin Laden, the Occupy movement and the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.","7864":"Best known to American audiences for his roles in the comedies \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d and \u201cGet Him to the Greek\u201d (and perhaps for his off-screen identity as the husband of the pop star Katy Perry), Mr. Brand has also written two best-selling autobiographies, \u201cMy Booky Wook: A Memoir of Sex, Drugs and Stand-Up\u201d and \u201cMy Booky Wook 2: This Time It\u2019s Personal.\u201d In his writing, Mr. Brand has amply owned up to drug and sex addictions that dogged him earlier in his career and cost him a hosting job at British MTV, where he came to work dressed as Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. He set off another British broadcasting scandal in 2008 when he and Jonathan Ross left a series of lewd messages on the actor Andrew Sachs\u2019s answering machine during a show co-hosted by Mr. Brand and Mr. Ross.","7868":"His interviews, which tend to be freewheeling and nonconfrontational, have produced some memorable moments in the presidential campaign. He prompted Representative Ron Paul of Texas to admit that his noninterventionist foreign policy would have precluded him from carrying out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. And in comments that grabbed headlines, Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, told Mr. Conway that he would fire Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.","7869":"The plaintiffs presented evidence that a senior Hezbollah fighter, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in 2008, had been an important liaison between Iran and Al Qaeda, meeting with Osama bin Laden in 1993 and introducing him to the strategy of suicide attacks that drove the Americans from Lebanon in the early 1980s. The defendants were not represented in the lawsuit, and it is unclear how the plaintiffs would collect damages.","787":"Although American and British officials say they have 'no doubt' that Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda terrorist organization were behind the crimes of Sept. 11, so far no actual evidence has been made public. The Bush administration has given secret briefings to leaders of NATO and American allies, but the strongest information the public has of a link between Mr. bin Laden and the terrorists' acts is that Mohammad Atta, one of the hijackers, received $100,000 from a source in Pakistan that apparently cannot be definitely identified.","7870":"The Year in Rap: 2011 from Flocabulary 2011: We\u2019re looking back, We ran around the sun, it\u2019s the Year in Rap.

In his writing, Mr. Brand has amply owned up to drug and sex addictions that dogged him earlier in his career and cost him a hosting job at British MTV, where he came to work dressed as Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. He set off another British broadcasting scandal in 2008 when he and Jonathan Ross left a series of lewd messages on the actor Andrew Sachs's answering machine during a show co-hosted by Mr. Brand and Mr. Ross.","7872":"On May 2, a U.S. Navy Seals team caught Osama bin Laden in the military town Abbottabad and killed him. Before long, American officials were quoted questioning whether their Pakistani allies were just incompetent or actually complicit. (The Americans who deal with Pakistan believe that General Kayani and the director of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, were genuinely surprised and embarrassed that Bin Laden was so close by, though the Americans fault the Pakistanis for not looking very hard.) In Pakistan, Kayani faced rumbles of insurrection for letting Americans violate Pakistani sovereignty; a defining victory for President Obama was a humiliation for Kayani and Pasha.","7873":"It would have been more of a boon to our national security to finish off the Afghanistan mission and kill Osama bin Laden sooner. Instead, the Bush team let itself get distracted with nation-building in Iraq when our own nation was falling apart, and President Obama ended up surging and withdrawing in Afghanistan at the same time, which made no sense.","7874":"The drone strikes and commando raids that the president recently boasted had killed \u201c22 out of 30 top Al Qaeda leaders,\u201d including Osama bin Laden, were honed in the night raids by American troops on militants in Iraq.","7876":"Mr. Romney, however, praised Mr. Obama for capturing and killing Osama bin Laden.","7878":"Finally, Al Qaeda writ large is much weaker than it was eight years ago. More than half of its top leaders have been arrested or killed \u2014 including, this year, Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki. But we must keep a wary eye on it, as well as on related terrorist groups, like the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba.","7879":"Pushed by the army, a Pakistani Supreme Court hearing set to begin on Monday will investigate whether Mr. Zardari\u2019s government was behind an unsigned memorandum that surfaced in October, purportedly asking the Obama administration\u2019s help to curb the military\u2019s influence and avert a possible coup in the wake of the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May.","788":"A federal judge in Manhattan has refused to dismiss charges against or grant a new trial for two men convicted in connection with the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa, which the authorities say were masterminded by Osama bin Laden. The judge, Leonard B. Sand, said Tuesday that there was no merit to arguments by the two defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a Saudi man who helped to deliver the bomb in Nairobi; and Wadih El-Hage, who was convicted of terrorism conspiracy. Two other convicted defendants did not file motions; all four men are to be sentenced this month. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","7880":"Twitter and Facebook released similar lists of the topics and news events that caught fire among users during the year. Twitter cited the revolts in Egypt and the very public meltdown of the actor Charlie Sheen, while on Facebook, the death of Osama bin Laden and the Super Bowl were among the most popular items.","7882":"The memo, whose authenticity has not been verified but which has been published in Pakistani newspapers, asked top American military officials for help in preventing a coup in Pakistan in exchange for help with the war on militants and an array of other diplomatic and security considerations. It was reportedly sent in May, after the American operation that killed Osama bin Laden.","7883":"As he took questions from reporters, Mr. Perry said he believed that his campaign was gaining strength in Iowa. He said he looked forward to a debate over the economy and foreign policy with President Obama. A freelance photographer and writer from Chicago, who was in the group of reporters, asked Mr. Perry how he could compete with Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy credentials, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7885":"Likewise, having an approval rating of about 46 or 47 percent is familiar territory for Mr. Obama. His approval ratings have generally been in that range since January 2010, with the exceptions of rally-around-the-flag bounces following the attempted assassination of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the killing of Osama bin Laden, and what now looks to have been a temporary dip after the debt ceiling debacle.","7887":"The future role of Pakistan is not yet clear. For now, General Allen said, he is focused on repairing the damage done to American-Pakistani relations after a NATO air attack struck two Pakistani border posts last month, killing 25 soldiers. Since then, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has been closed to NATO trucks. The relationship, already deeply troubled by the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani safe house in May, has worsened.","7888":"Polls for The Washington Post-ABC News and for CNN showed nearly half of Americans approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing, up from percentages that have been in the low 40s this year except for a brief rise after the killing of Osama bin Laden. In the Post-ABC poll, Mr. Obama had reversed Republicans\u2019 edge in an October poll on who is more trusted on the issue of taxes.","7889":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani lashed out against his country\u2019s powerful military on Thursday, warning of conspiracies against the civilian government. His accusations threw a spotlight on swirling rumors that the military might have plotted a coup after being humiliated by the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","789":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Within a week after the terror attacks, 14 members of Osama bin Laden's family, among others, were spirited out of this country back home to Saudi Arabia.","7890":"The military did not elaborate on what General Kayani meant. But his remarks were seen as a reference to allegations that Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States, backed by the elected government, had sought Washington\u2019s help in heading off a coup and asserting civilian control over the military in the wake of the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May. The allegations are particularly inflammatory because many Pakistanis see the United States as an enemy, despite the nations\u2019 long-standing alliance.","7893":"THOSE WEREN\u2019T JUST tank lights leaving the desert behind. That was the darkness of a nearly nine-year war made visible. The soldiers moved through the sandstorms, and landed back home in the United States to deal with the continuing legacy of American foreign policies. In 2011, Barack Obama\u2019s promises were finally beginning to find their way onto the front pages. A spectacular nighttime raid found Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Relations between the C.I.A. and Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or ISI, had slowly improved since the nadir after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden last May, they said.","7971":"In addition to the Guantanamo findings, it indicates that majorities approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy, national security and counter-terrorism.

The president\u2019s role in encouraging the Arab Spring, she said, had displaced a reliable ally in Egypt and opened the door to the Muslim Brotherhood and the spread of Sharia law in the Middle East.","7975":"The complaint comes at a time when the Navy and the White House have already come under fire from some quarters for releasing details about the Seals\u2019 role in killing Osama bin Laden and rescuing an American aid worker from Somali pirates. To some, the Seals have become serial violators of the Special Operator code of media silence.","7977":"WASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States turns increasingly to Special Operations forces to confront developing threats scattered around the world, the nation\u2019s top Special Operations officer, a member of the Navy Seals who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, is seeking new authority to move his forces faster and outside of normal Pentagon deployment channels.","7978":"But the oddest thing about Mr. Patek\u2019s situation was his arrest by the Pakistani police last March: He was apprehended 4,000 miles from Indonesia, in Abbottabad, the very same Pakistani city where Osama bin Laden had taken refuge. They might have been neighbors. Nobody\u2019s saying.","798":"Indeed, it was perhaps to buttress those arguments that Mr. Blair today laid before Parliament what he termed the evidence against Osama bin Laden.","7980":"His extradition in August from Pakistan, where security forces had arrested him seven months earlier near Abbottabad, the town where United States Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden last May, was considered a boon for Indonesian intelligence.","7981":"Special Operations forces have long enjoyed an elite position in the United States military, and achieved something like folk-hero status when Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan last May. The admiration is well-deserved, but an article in Monday\u2019s Times drew attention to the power they\u2019ve accrued of late, and raised questions about just how much independence they should have.","7982":"Showing steady improvement since early December, Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating has reached the 50 percent mark in The Times/CBS News poll \u2014 an important baseline in presidential politics and his highest approval rating since May 2010 (excepting the brief bump he received after Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011).","7983":"But more than anything, a recent string of arrests of associates of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has fed impressions here that the authorities may be getting closer to the man himself. For Mr. Calder\u00f3n in this presidential election year, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s capture would be something akin to the killing of Osama bin Laden.","7984":"Al Qaeda was caught off guard by the Arab Spring\u2019s largely nonviolent, secular revolutions fueled by social media. The death of Osama bin Laden in May dealt the organization another major blow, and it has been seeking a foothold ever since.","7985":"Mr. Abdulmutallab, who wore a white T-shirt and tan pants, spoke for about three minutes. He claimed that Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders who had been killed \u201care alive and shall be victorious by God\u2019s grace.\u201d He also said terrorist attacks would continue \u201cuntil the Jews are driven out of Palestine.\u201d","7986":"Mr. Ferjani compared his years in London to the intellectual awakening he underwent in Kairouan in the 1970s. Settling with his wife and five children in the neighborhood of Ealing, he remained in Islamist circles, soon embroiled in the debates over Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, but broadening his horizons into civil society. He took classes on the history of Europe, democracy, the environment and social change.","7987":"Pointing out such concerns is, of course, the province of a spouse. The difference when a head of state\u2019s spouse performs an advisory role is that both the content and its consequences resonate through a lot more than one household. And that\u2019s the point of Jodi Kantor\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Obamas.\u201d Call it chick nonfiction, if you will; this book is not about politics, it\u2019s about marriage, or at least one marriage, and a notably successful one at that. This is a couple who listen to each other, and no one believes more in America\u2019s 44th president than his wife. Last August, at a party for his 50th birthday, Kantor writes, Mrs. Obama toasted her husband for passing the health care bill, appointing two women to the Supreme Court and killing \u00adOsama bin Laden. When he signaled for the accolades to be toned down, she cut him off. \u201cNo, you\u2019re just going to stand there and listen,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI know it makes you uncomfortable, but you only turn 50 once, so you\u2019re just going to have to take it.\u201d And he did.","7988":"Recent events, like the killing of Osama bin Laden and the January hostage rescue in Somalia, have dramatically raised the public profile of the SEALs. For the members involved, recruitment was not the main motive to take part in \u201cAct of Valor.\u201d","7989":"President Obama has done better. He poured more resources into training the Afghan army and police, and a \u201csurge\u201d of an additional 50,000 American troops has weakened the Taliban\u2019s fighting forces. Stepped-up intelligence efforts have led to the deaths of Osama bin Laden and scores of Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. The Taliban have recently said they want to talk.","799":"JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 4\u2014 Not everyone in this cosmopolitan port that claims Osama bin Laden as a native son is ready to label him a terrorist just yet.","7991":"Those pledges of support for Israel and criticisms of the president on his handling of Iran are likely to become ever more strident as the Republican candidates look for ways to criticize Mr. Obama\u2019s foreign policy. The president\u2019s support for the war in Afghanistan, his carefully managed withdrawal of troops in Iraq and his successful killing of dozens of terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden \u2014 have robbed Republicans of some of their usual critiques.","7992":"Previously, Mr. Rohrabacher has tried to limit American aid to Pakistan. Last week, he proposed that Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani who helped lead the Central Intelligence Agency to Osama bin Laden last May, should be awarded a Congressional Gold Medal and an American passport.","7993":"That dispute may have been partly settled earlier this month when a video surfaced in which Ayman al-Zawahri \u2013 who took over as Al Qaeda\u2019s leader after United States forces killed Osama bin Laden last year \u2013 said that the Shabab, a militant Islamist group in Somalia, had formally joined Al Qaeda.","7994":"The movie includes scenes in which Ms. Palin appears not to know which nations were on which side during World War I and World War II. It also shows Ms. Palin appearing to believe that Saddam Hussein, not Osama bin Laden, launched the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","7995":"ISLAMABAD \u2014 The Pakistani authorities moved on Saturday to demolish the house where Osama bin Laden died at the hands of Navy SEALs last May, erasing a three-story building that had acquired a painful symbolism for Pakistan\u2019s powerful military, which was badly embarrassed by the American raid.","7996":"ISLAMABAD -- The Pakistani authorities moved on Saturday to demolish the house where Osama bin Laden died at the hands of Navy SEALs last May, erasing a three-story building that had acquired a painful symbolism for Pakistan's powerful military, which was badly embarrassed by the American raid.","7997":"And it\u2019s worth pointing out that the administration\u2019s emphasis on secrecy comes and goes depending on the news. Reporters were immediately and endlessly briefed on the \u201csecret\u201d operation that successfully found and killed Osama bin Laden. And the drone program in Pakistan and Afghanistan comes to light in a very organized and systematic way every time there is a successful mission.","7998":"An article on Sunday about the demolition of the residential compound in Pakistan where American commandos killed Osama bin Laden in a May 2011 raid misidentified the government position held by Leon E. Panetta, who raised questions in a recent televised interview about Pakistani authorities\u2019 failure to investigate the compound before the raid.

It remains unclear whether the Algerians had decided to attack a particular target in the United States and, if so, where it was. Nor is it clear whether Mr. Haouari was following the lead of some more internationally known terrorist leader, for instance Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is accused by the United States of masterminding the bombings of American Embassies in Africa in 1998 that left more than 200 dead. Intelligence officials say Mr. bin Laden has operated training camps in Afghanistan.","80":"The Security Council imposed financial and airline sanctions against the Taliban last year after they refused to expel Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born terrorist suspected of organizing the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","800":"On Tuesday, the United States briefed its allies on its investigation, and NATO agreed that there was 'clear and compelling evidence' that Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization were behind the attacks.","8001":"Likewise, he eventually accepted that he was legally considered to have been part of a conspiracy with the founder of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, even though \u201cI\u2019ve never met him, obviously.\u201d","8002":"But he failed to produce hard evidence to back up his earlier allegations, although he did make fresh attacks on the president. Citing \u201cintelligence sources,\u201d Mr. Ijaz told the commission on Friday that Mr. Zardari had prior knowledge of the American Special Forces raid in May that killed Osama bin Laden.","8005":"The unremitting Western narrative of Pakistan is that of a \u201cfailed state.\u201d Neglected in that narrative is the fact that the American-led war on terror has resulted in approximately 30,000 Pakistani civilian casualties, the equivalent of a Sept. 11, 2001, every year. Last November, NATO forces inadvertently killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. United State drone strikes have killed 1,717 to 2,680 individuals from 2004 to present, with a 17 percent nonmilitant casualty rate since 2004, according to the New America Foundation. Then there was the \u201cvaccination\u201d program which, according to The Guardian, was set up to help gather intelligence on Osama bin Laden. Anger about the vaccine scheme caused officials from an aid agency, Save the Children, to evacuate the country for two weeks and fueled distrust of immunizations. In a region where nearly 1 in 10 children die before their fifth birthday \u2014 the majority from diarrhea, pneumonia or vaccine-preventable diseases \u2013 this was a major public health setback.","8006":"Machine Guns Vegas \u2014 an upscale indoor shooting range complete with skimpily dressed gun-toting hostesses \u2014 opened last week a half-mile from the Strip with an armory of weapons and a promise to fulfill the desires of anyone wanting to fire off an Uzi or a vintage Thompson submachine gun. With its provocative mix of violent fantasy (think blowing holes through an Osama bin Laden target with an AK-47) and sexual allure, it is the latest example of how the extravagances and excesses that have defined Las Vegas are moving beyond the gambling table.","8007":"Mr. Panetta recited a series of national security decisions by Mr. Obama: Deploying an additional 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan, ordering American participation in the bombing campaign in Libya and sending in the SEAL team that killed Osama bin Laden. He also listed a string of other military enterprises in which Israel and the United States work hand in hand.","8008":"They also have peddled the canard that the president is weak on foreign policy. Mr. Romney on Tuesday called President Obama \u201cAmerica\u2019s most feckless president since Carter.\u201d Never mind that Mr. Obama ordered the successful raid to kill Osama bin Laden and has pummeled Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders, all without the Republicans\u2019 noxious dead-or-alive swagger. Now, for the sake of scoring political points, Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Newt Gingrich, who is hanging on only thanks to one backer\u2019s millions, seem determined to push Israel toward a reckless attack on Iran.","8009":"RAWALPINDI, Pakistan \u2014 In his quest for the truth about his country\u2019s most notorious guest, Shaukat Qadir started where it all ended: the room where Osama bin Laden was killed.","801":"JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 4\u2014 Not everyone in this cosmopolitan port that claims Osama bin Laden as a native son is ready to label him a terrorist just yet.","8010":"The trailer takes viewers back to election night 2008, as the soon-to-be first family \u2013 an increasingly prominent tableau in this election year \u2013 greets the mass of revelers in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park.

Now humor \u2014 mordant or zany \u2014 is the default mode. At Laurent Godin the Chinese conceptualist Wang Du displays a circle of 30 life-size white busts of Osama bin Laden. This is a topical one-liner, perhaps, but the title, \u201cImage Absolue,\u201d is suggestive of something more. Bin Laden haunts contemporary imagination as a figure not only of evil but also of unwavering conviction. In modern secular society such purity of purpose is mystifying and frightening, yet somehow also compelling. Making him the butt of a joke does not entirely undo his lingering, enigmatic threat to Western complacency.","8013":"The trailer takes viewers back to election night 2008, as the soon-to-be first family - an increasingly prominent tableau in this election year - greets the mass of revelers in Chicago's Grant Park.

Tensions rose in January 2011 after a C.I.A. contractor shot and killed two Pakistanis in Lahore, and then worsened in May after the surprise American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, 35 miles north of the ISI\u2019s headquarters in Islamabad. In September, Adm. Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Congressional hearing that the pro-Taliban militant group known as the Haqqani network was a \u201cvirtual arm\u201d of the ISI, prompting fresh tumult.","8015":"Every now and then, the timing of a news event is precise enough that we probably can attribute a change in approval ratings to it. There was very little doubt, for instance, that the killing of Osama bin Laden almost immediately improved Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings, while the contentious resolution to the debt-ceiling debate lowered them.","8016":"* In 2004, Osama bin Laden released a provocative recording just days before the election pitting President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. Bin Laden bragged about the Sept. 11 attacks and condemned Mr. Bush and America.","8018":"A themeless, defensive and pudding-like message \u2014 things are slowly getting better, and anyway they could have been worse, and you can\u2019t trust the Republicans, and did we mention that Osama bin Laden is dead? \u2014 can still be a winning one.

This is certainly the most complete book we are likely to see about the F.B.I.\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations, from Emma Goldman to Osama bin Laden. The problem with some F.B.I. histories is that they come off as a list of unrelated cases \u2014 case after case after very old case. Where Mr. Weiner excels is in connecting the dots. He identifies his themes, almost all involving the conflicting demands of civil liberties and civil order \u2014 \u201cthe saga of our struggle to be both safe and free,\u201d as he puts it \u2014 and rigorously pursues them. As far back as 1941, for example, he finds echoes of the contemporary debate over military tribunals in the F.B.I. case against a group of Nazi saboteurs who, after a peremptory trial before a secret court approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, were executed within weeks of their arrests.","8021":"\u201cThe Road We\u2019ve Traveled\u201d was conceived and produced by the campaign to stand out from standard political video fare. For starters, it was directed by Davis Guggenheim, the Oscar-winning director whose film credits include \u201cWaiting for Superman\u201d and \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d It features interviews with Obama administration officials past and present, including Vice President Joseph R.

He became the first president to authorize the assassination of a United States citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico and played an operational role in Al Qaeda, and was killed in an American drone strike in Yemen. And, of course, Mr. Obama ordered and oversaw the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","8075":"Just last year, the dinner played a cameo role in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. When he showed up at the dinner, Mr. Obama had just given the order for the helicopter incursion into Pakistan to burst into a compound where the Al Qaeda leader was suspected of living.

Part of the ad was Bill Clinton effectively talking about the decision to kill the terrorist. But, in the middle, the Obama people threw in a low-minded attack on Romney.

'But we're coming back.'","8134":"ON the anniversary of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death last week, Pakistan was the only Muslim country in which hundreds of demonstrators gathered to show solidarity with the dead terrorist figurehead.","8135":"READERS going through the cache of letters that were released early this month from Osama bin Laden\u2019s hideaway in Abbottabad, Pakistan, may have been taken aback by a reference \u2014 in the midst of discussions of tactics, regional politics and exchange rates for ransom money \u2014 to poetry.","8138":"The personal accusations \u2014 that Mr. Obama is aloof, that he has not learned from experience, that he has snubbed former supporters \u2014 are nasty but vague. Some are even contradictory. Michelle Obama is presented as both overbearing and lazy. Caroline Kennedy, Oprah Winfrey, Valerie Jarrett and Samantha Power are all presented as aggrieved and, in Ms. Power\u2019s case, demonic. And the photos that accompany \u201cThe Amateur\u201d are bizarre enough to include Desir\u00e9e Rogers, whose track record as the White House\u2019s social secretary is barely mentioned; Al Capone, because he and Mr. Obama both count as Chicagoans; and the famous Situation Room shot of administration members watching the Navy SEAL team\u2019s raid on Osama bin Laden.","8139":"Mr. Romney, however, has at times proven a chatty and news-making figure on the rope lines, to his aides\u2019 frustration. It was there, for example, that Mr. Romney told reporters that \u201ceven Jimmy Carter would have given that order\u201d to kill Osama bin Laden. And it was where he reacted to Rush Limbaugh\u2019s comments that a Georgetown University student was a \u201cslut,\u201d saying that he would have chosen different language, but declining to condemn it.","814":"Soon Mr. Gouttierre was teaching English and coaching basketball in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. Instead of the Peace Corps' standard two years, he stayed nearly 10. Then he came here to the University of Nebraska's Omaha campus, home to the nation's only Center for Afghanistan Studies and its largest library of works on Afghanistan. As dean of international studies, he visited 70-some nations before losing count, and has studied the Taliban and Osama bin Laden for the United Nations.","8140":"Mr. Obama called off a planned visit to Pakistan last year after the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed Osama bin Laden. That Bin Laden had been living there confirmed what American officials had long suspected: Despite Pakistani protests to the contrary, the man behind the Sept. 11 attacks had been hiding in the country for years.","8142":"The ad also gives Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign the opportunity to once again mention his decision to kill Osama bin Laden. It uses grainy, green-tinted video from military raids while Mr. Obama praises the soldiers who went on the operation.","8143":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 A Pakistani doctor who helped the Central Intelligence Agency pin down Osama bin Laden\u2019s location under the cover of a vaccination drive was convicted on Wednesday of treason and sentenced to 33 years in prison, a senior official in Pakistan said.","8144":"\u201cYou are the first class in nine years that will graduate into a world where there are no Americans fighting in Iraq,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cFor the first time in your lives \u2014 and thanks to Air Force personnel who did their part \u2014 Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to our country. We\u2019ve put Al Qaeda on the path to defeat. And you are the first graduates since 9/11 who can clearly see how we\u2019ll end the war in Afghanistan.\u201d","8145":"A unanimous Senate Armed Services Committee took a bipartisan shot at Pakistan on Thursday for the sentencing of the physician who helped catch Osama bin Laden, approving a $631.4 billion defense policy bill that withholds aid to the wavering ally until supply lines are open, support for terrorist networks ceases and the doctor,\u00a0 Shakil Afridi,\u00a0 is released.","8146":"A new issue arose when a Pakistani tribal court sentenced a Pakistani doctor, Shakil Afridi, to 33 years in prison on Wednesday for treason after he helped the C.I.A. locate Osama bin Laden\u2019s hide-out in Pakistan last year. In Washington, administration officials and members of Congress reacted with fury over the sentencing.","8147":"In addition, Mr. Obama has embraced the use of drones to assassinate terrorist leaders. And he authorized the raid that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden.","8148":"The two men have not always been at odds. Mr. Obama expressed gratitude for how attentive Mr. Bush was in ensuring a smooth transition in the winter of 2008-9, and he later tapped his predecessor to work with former President Bill Clinton on relief efforts after a killer earthquake in Haiti. Mr. Obama likewise called Mr. Bush after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and as recently as March, said he gave \u201ca lot of credit to my predecessor\u201d for his immigration policies.","8149":"Weeks \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best Sellers: E-Book NonfictionThis Last On Week Week List 1 1 MOST TALKATIVE, by Andy Cohen.

In this special we see Massoud, perpetually in combat fatigues and a crewneck sweater, sitting cross-legged on the floor and crouching over an old Soviet map as he plots his strategy against the Taliban. In interviews the camera easily captures why he was considered so charismatic: his face is sculptured in strong lines, his manner calm but forceful, his hat worn rakishly to the side in the manner of a politician who knows how to exploit his theatrical strengths.","8150":"Far from moving toward some kind of easing of tension, relations have only worsened since then. On three days last week, American drones fired missiles at what were thought to be insurgent hide-outs in northwestern Pakistan, ending a brief lull heading into the NATO summit meeting and ignoring demands by Pakistan\u2019s Parliament to end the strikes altogether. And on Wednesday, a court in Pakistan convicted a doctor who helped the C.I.A. in the search for Osama bin Laden, sentencing him to 33 years in prison for treason.","8151":"Mr. Obama was heartened, aides say, by a letter discovered in the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan. It complained that the American president had undermined Al Qaeda\u2019s support by repeatedly declaring that the United States was at war not with Islam, but with the terrorist network. \u201cWe must be doing a good job,\u201d Mr. Obama told his secretary of state.","8152":"May 2011 was considered a newsy month, because the raid that killed Osama bin Laden was a hot subject.","8153":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 Tribal court documents show that the Pakistani doctor who was sentenced to 33 years in prison after helping the C.I.A. track down Osama bin Laden had not been charged with treason, as some Pakistani officials had initially reported.","8154":"Another former Republican secretary of state, James A. Baker III, backed Mr. McCain in February 2008, and he said last year that Mr. Romney would make the strongest Republican nominee. Mr. Baker intends to endorse Mr. Romney, according to his policy assistant, John Williams, who said that Mr. Baker was \u201c120 percent behind Mitt Romney.\u201d Former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was not available for comment, an aide said. But he came to Mr. Romney\u2019s aid in early May, saying it was not a tough decision for Mr. Obama to attack Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound, a comment that buttressed Mr. Romney as he complained that the president was politicizing the anniversary of the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed Bin Laden.","8155":"Still, it is a far cry from the nearly 300 American military trainers and other personnel operating in Pakistan just a few years ago. The last of about 125 Special Forces trainers, who advised scores of Pakistani Frontier Corps paramilitary soldiers in different locations, left Pakistan a year ago when tensions between the two countries spiked following the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","8156":"LONDON \u2014 Shakil Afridi, a doctor who worked with the C.I.A. to collect DNA samples of Osama bin Laden under the guise of a bogus vaccination program, was sentenced last week to 33 years in prison under Pakistan\u2019s tribal justice system. America\u2019s hero is Pakistan\u2019s traitor. And Afridi\u2019s sentence is the latest point of contention in the stalled relations between the United States and Pakistan. Last Friday an affronted U.S. Senate panel cut $33 million in aid \u2014 $1 million for every year of Afridi\u2019s sentence. The trial\u2019s many irregularities are attracting a fair bit of attention. Afridi was denied legal representation. He was tried under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, a draconian code governing Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas but not Abbottabad, where he was operating. Even by the standards of that law he was given an excessive sentence. And it remains unclear what exactly he was tried for: \u201cantistate\u201d activities or providing support and medical treatment to members of the Lashkar-e-Islam, a militant group based in Pakistan\u2019s northwestern tribal areas?","8157":"Even the killing of Osama bin Laden, which was widely supported by members of both political parties, made some progressives queasy because of its implications for defining the executive powers of the presidency to order an assassination.","8158":"Lawyers for Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who helped the C.I.A. find Osama bin Laden, lodged an appeal on Friday to overturn his conviction. On May 23, tribal authorities sentenced Dr. Afridi to 33 years in prison and fined him $3,500, although the conviction related to charges of aiding the militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, rather than ties to the C.I.A. The appeal document said that the charges were \u201cfalse, concocted and without foundation\u201d because Dr. Afridi had no links with Lashkar-i-Islam, and that he had not received a fair trial under the legal framework that applies in Pakistan\u2019s tribal belt. It said Dr. Afridi was kidnapped by Lashkar-i-Islam in 2008 and forced to pay a ransom of $10,600 to win his freedom.","8159":"Thus the museum will begin the tale in 1979 with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, where radical Islamic fighters, who gained power with the support of the United States, later gave Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda safe haven.","816":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 5\u2014 Investigators have discovered that one of the suspected hijackers of the jet that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11 was tied to two previous attacks against American targets by Osama bin Laden's terror network, American and foreign officials said.","8161":"Mr. Gardner: Over the years I have interacted with thousands of high school teachers who are struggling with how to teach 9/11 in the classroom.\u00a0 They wonder about what to say about the perpetrators.\u00a0 For the most part, they all report the same thing: the biggest challenge is that students want to know why this happened. Some education programs out there go as far back as the crusades to begin the conversation of religiously motivated conflicts and brutal acts through time. The scope of a timeline affects the depth of context it provides for historic events such as 9/11. A shorter timeline may lead to very different causes and conclusions than a timeline of greater scope.\u00a0 This raises the interesting question of when does the history of 9/11 begin. In the September 11th Education Program, the timeline begins in December 1979 with Soviet forces invading Afghanistan. Our first mention of Osama bin Laden references how he provided financial and organizational aid to the mujahedin in Afghanistan in 1980.","8162":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The fate of one of the United States\u2019 most dedicated enemies was the subject of mounting speculation on Monday after a drone strike in Pakistan\u2019s tribal belt was said to have targeted Abu Yahya al-Libi, a Qaeda commander who escaped American custody in 2005 and became the group\u2019s deputy leader after Osama bin Laden\u2019s death last year.","8163":"Given the command\u2019s influence in shaping American strategy toward extremism, the proposal seemed to have momentum. President Obama and his Pentagon\u2019s leadership are tapping Special Operations troops more to hunt militants and train foreign security forces in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. And Admiral McRaven is a White House favorite, especially after he oversaw the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","8164":"Mr. Libi\u2019s death would be another dramatic moment for an American covert war in Pakistan that has been particularly active over the past year, starting with the death of the group\u2019s founder, Osama bin Laden, in May 2011 and followed up by drone strikes against several senior lieutenants, including Atiyah Abd al-Rahman.","8165":"The United States put a bounty on his head, offering in 2009 (in this reward poster) as much as $1 million merely for information on his whereabouts. After the killing of Osama bin Laden last year, Mr. Libi was promoted to the No. 2 position under Ayman al-Zawahri.","8166":"Change, he said, has included the Lilly Ledbetter law making it easier for women to challenge unfair pay scales; a revival of the manufacturing sector, especially in automaking and clean energy; expanded health insurance coverage, including provisions for young adults to remain longer on their parents\u2019 policies and guaranteeing insurance for people once rejected for having pre-existing medical conditions, and the killing of Osama bin Laden and weakening of Al Qaeda.","8167":"He chuckled along with his audience about Pakistan\u2019s lack of warning before the United States killed Osama bin Laden in a raid last year near a huge Pakistani Army base. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know about our operation,\u201d Mr. Panetta said to laughter. \u201cThat was the whole idea.\u201d","8168":"Mr. Harris also noted jokes exchanged between Mr. Panetta and Indian officials over Pakistan\u2019s exclusion from the raid that killed Osama bin Laden \u2014 something \u201cnot likely to be received warmly in Islamabad,\u201d he wrote.","8169":"He chuckled along with his audience about Pakistan\u2019s lack of warning before the United States killed Osama bin Laden in a raid last year near a huge Pakistani Army base. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know about our operation,\u201d Mr. Panetta said to laughter. \u201cThat was the whole idea.\u201d","817":"The American case against Osama bin Laden has now been put before the world, thanks to Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. Mr. Blair said Thursday that his review of the evidence left 'absolutely no doubt' that Mr. bin Laden and his terrorist network were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. Some Americans may be wondering whether the world will find those assurances from our closest European ally particularly convincing. But the report released by Britain, in a move coordinated with the White House, demonstrates that the Bush administration has enough information about the links between Mr. bin Laden, the Taliban leadership of Afghanistan and the terrorist assaults to make a strong case.","8170":"Again, the strategy, aided by the killing of Osama bin Laden by a Navy SEAL team, worked to a degree. With Al Qaeda effectively dismantled, a government that is good enough to run the country is likely to be sufficient to achieve core American national security objectives as well.","8171":"Again, the strategy, aided by the killing of Osama bin Laden by a Navy SEAL team, worked to a degree. With Al Qaeda effectively dismantled, a government that is good enough to run the country is likely to be sufficient to achieve core American national security objectives as well.","8172":"For now, Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda\u2019s nominal leader, still holds the broad influence that he has consolidated since Osama bin Laden\u2019s death last year. But the hierarchical structure of global jihad may be loosening a bit. Mr. Libi\u2019s death in a drone strike has torn at the connective tissue between the group\u2019s embattled leadership in Pakistan and its far-flung affiliates across the Middle East and Africa.","8173":"They followed previous disclosures about the operation that located and killed Osama bin Laden, both in the aftermath of the raid and then again around its anniversary this spring.","8174":"The authenticity of the letter could not be verified. The document is not dated but appears to have been written this year because it makes reference to the imprisonment of Osama bin Laden\u2019s family in Pakistan. His family has since been ordered to leave the country.","8175":"That success is all the more startling for its setting in a region awash with violence and intrigue: to the east of Chitral is the Swat Valley, where Pakistan\u2019s army fought Taliban insurgents in 2009; to the west lies the Afghan province of Nuristan, where American troops have seen some of their toughest combat. Some years ago mysterious Americans turned up in town asking questions about Osama bin Laden; locals said they worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.","8176":"They followed previous disclosures about the operation that located and killed Osama bin Laden, both in the aftermath of the raid and then again around its anniversary this spring.","8177":"Political calculations also loom on the American side. A visit to Afghanistan and India this week by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta had the diplomatic effect of a baseball game in a tea shop. In New Delhi, Mr. Panetta stridently defended drone strikes, and he chuckled publicly about excluding the Pakistanis from the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on their soil, still a sore point here. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, Mr. Panetta warned that American officials were reaching \u201cthe limits of our patience\u201d with Pakistan.","8178":"Mr. Obama assumes foreign policy will be an advantage for him, particularly because of his record of pulling troops out of Iraq, helping topple the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, taking robust action against terrorists and authorizing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","8179":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A Pakistani Taliban commander has banned polio vaccinations in North Waziristan, in the tribal belt, days before 161,000 children were to be inoculated. He linked the ban to American drone strikes and fears that the C.I.A. could use the polio campaign as cover for espionage, much as it did with Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who helped track Osama bin Laden.","818":"Robert A. Pape and Chaim Kaufmann suggest (Op-Ed, Oct. 4) that by publicly disclosing concrete evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the recent attacks, it will be easier to gain support among the Arab public in the Middle East. The biggest deficiency in this approach is that there are no true democracies among the Middle Eastern Arab countries, and therefore no freedom of the press to reliably disseminate any of this concrete evidence.","8181":"The crew, working for Al Arabiya TV, is led by Baker Atyani, a well-known Jordanian journalist who had scored an interview with Osama bin Laden in June 2001. In the interview, Bin Laden offered a veiled and ominous warning about an upcoming attack against the United States.","8182":"Designed by the busy and very talented Soutra Gilmour, this is a classic yesterday-is-today production, set in what looks like a contemporary war room. As the critic Michael Billington pointed out in The Guardian, the opening image \u2013 in which a tense, seated group of government and military personnel cheer images of a martial victory being simulcast on a screen \u2013 brings to mind President Obama and company learning of the killing of Osama bin Laden.","8183":"This constancy is nothing new. There have been few major changes in Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings for the past two or three years. Reaction to the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona, and to the killing of Osama bin Laden, produced temporary shifts toward Mr. Obama in the polls, while reaction to the debt ceiling debate produced a temporary unfavorable one. Otherwise, Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings have remained in the mid-to-high 40s.","8184":"He was the last remaining defendant to be tried in Indonesia for the bombing. His capture last year in Abbottabad, Pakistan \u2013 just a month before United States Navy Seals found and killed Osama bin Laden in the same city \u2013 raised worldwide attention and ended a manhunt that had lasted for nearly a decade.","8185":"You report (news article, June 19) that the Taliban is blocking polio vaccinations in Pakistan. This is unconscionable. But it also points to our government\u2019s unconscionable choice to use a fake vaccination campaign as an espionage method to try to get into Osama bin Laden\u2019s complex in Pakistan.","8186":"He was working as a car salesman before he met Mr. Semoun and formed the team \u00c9lie et Dieudonn\u00e9. His repeated provocations against Jews, his tributes to the \u201ccharisma\u201d of Osama bin Laden and his praise for the \u201clack of pretension\u201d of Iran\u2019s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (whom he met during a 2010 trip to Iran) have upset many here. That list includes several mayors of French cities who have canceled his shows, fearing public disorder, and former supporters like Mr. Semoun. The two comedians worked together for about seven years until their breakup in 1997, and his ex-partner says Dieudonn\u00e9 has stepped well beyond standards of morality, let alone good taste.","8187":"In the same town, Sufian bin Qumu leads a militia that flies the black flag of militant Islam. A former truck driver for Osama bin Laden who spent six years as a prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, Mr. Qumu says the Koran is the only constitution he knows. He insists that he will remain armed until Libya adopts a Taliban-style Islamic government.","8188":"\u201cThe rich inhabit a parallel reality everywhere, although in Pakistan their opulence seems excessive because the middle class is so stunted,\u201d said Moni Mohsin, a writer who specializes in social satire. \u201cBut if it was a stark choice between life in the pages of Hello! or as Osama bin Laden would have wanted it, I\u2019d go for Hello! It might drive me mad, but everyone has a right to a party.\u201d","8189":"Evidence of this shift is everywhere. When WikiLeaks released the ghostly footage of an Apache firing on a group of men in Baghdad, the journalist Christopher Beam wrote in Slate, \u201cThe video, shot in black and white from a helicopter circling above a Baghdad neighborhood, will be familiar to anyone who has played the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or the sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\u201d After the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a digitally altered image circulated online of President Obama watching the operation with a PlayStation controller in hand.","819":"'What can I say to subdue their fear?' said Tony Scotti, who for decades has run a school in Bedford, Mass., that teaches security driving skills and surveillance detection. 'What do these people think? Is Osama bin Laden going to jump from a tree while they are driving from Teaneck? I am a businessman, of course, and yes, I want to train people. But nothing has changed for most people in the past three weeks. I just don't get it.'","8190":"Health care has been Exhibit A in that argument, a project he undertook at the cost of other ambitious efforts like curbing climate change or rewriting the tax code. While Mr. Obama will be remembered for bailing out the auto industry, winding down two wars and dispatching Osama bin Laden, health care was his play for history.","8191":"More recently, at the NATO meeting in Chicago in May, she found herself spending most of a tense meeting with Pakistan\u2019s president, Asif Ali Zardari, discussing, among other things, Pakistan\u2019s byzantine parliamentary politics. Relations with Pakistan have been one of the administration\u2019s failures, in large part a result of its greatest success: the killing of Osama bin Laden in a raid that surprised the Pakistanis and, as even American officials acknowledge, violated their sovereignty. Clinton has labored to get the relationship back on track \u2014 twice visiting Pakistan last year \u2014 only for new crises to erupt, first an American airstrike in November that killed 24 Pakistani troops at a border outpost and more recently the sentencing of a Pakistani doctor who helped the Central Intelligence Agency in the hunt for Bin Laden.","8192":"The killing of Osama bin Laden, she said, was a good example of a story that would benefit from an archive designed to capture multiple versions. From the first mention on the Web site to the final version many iterations later, she said, \u201cIt would be very interesting to watch it change over time.\u201d","8193":"Officials hope the crisis in relations caused by the killing of Osama bin Laden and other events will pass. Meanwhile, they are holding the Pakistanis more at arm\u2019s length and setting narrower goals; President Obama declined to hold an official meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari at the NATO summit meeting in Chicago in May.","8194":"The November airstrikes, which hit in Pakistani territory in response to reports of militant activity in the area, killed 24 soldiers.

He says the campaign\u2019s slogan boils down to \u201cOsama bin Laden is dead and G.M. is alive.\u201d Jabbing Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, for refusing to release more tax returns, Mr. Biden told a Hispanic audience, \u201cMitt Romney wants you to show your papers, but he won\u2019t show us his.\u201d","8282":"FOREIGN POLICY: B+ Obama brought troops home from Iraq and took out Osama bin Laden. He was superb in providing bold leadership in Libya, at a time when so many American experts were saying that the intervention wouldn\u2019t work. His unusual move in picking Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state has paid off brilliantly, and it\u2019s great to see the State Department pursuing a 21st-century agenda that includes girls\u2019 education as well as, say, arms control.","8283":"Mr. Obama is a curious mixture of bold and cautious. He spent months in what amounted to a grueling graduate seminar on Afghanistan and then disregarded his vice president and top advisers to order 30,000 more troops to the war zone. Even the action considered his most decisive, ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, took place only after months of secretly monitoring intelligence and considering options.","8284":"In a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have. We\u2019ve blunted the Taliban\u2019s momentum in Afghanistan, and in 2014, our longest war will be over.

A new tower rises above the New York skyline, al- Qaida is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead. (Cheers, applause.)","8287":"Lots of speakers tonight have mentioned Osama bin Laden. Joe Biden compared pre-raid statements on Bin Laden from Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. \u201cIn 2008, Barack Obama made a promise to the American people. He said, \u201cIf we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, we will take him out. That has to be our biggest national security priority.\u201d Versus \u201cGovernor Romney didn\u2019t see things that way. When he was asked about Bin Laden in 2007, he said, and I quote, \u2018it\u2019s not worth moving heaven and earth, and spending billions of dollars, just trying to catch one person.'\u201d","8288":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The Pakistani government appeared Thursday to have moved to expel international staff members at the aid agency Save the Children, apparently over accusations that one of its employees helped the C.I.A. recruit a Pakistani doctor who played a role in tracking Osama bin Laden last year.","8289":"He blunted the extreme message of the Tea Party by offering an alternative vision of government\u2019s obligation to help the neediest, provide everyone with the basic structures of society and the economy and end unconscionable discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans. He has protected women\u2019s constitutional rights and liberties, despite his own misgivings about abortion. He ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden \u2014 an act that was mentioned repeatedly on the last night of the convention.","829":"It turned out, though, that Mr. Koranie could tolerate only the first step in what might be a wide-ranging campaign: eliminating Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks, even though Mr. Koranie made clear he did not believe Mr. bin Laden was responsible. 'If the Americans go beyond Afghanistan, I am against it,' he said. And if King Abdullah sided with the Americans in an attack on, say, Iraq? Mr. Koranie predicted an uprising. 'The streets will have another opinion.'","8290":"Introducing Mr. Obama on Thursday night was Vice President Joseph R.

To the extent the subject came up in Charlotte, it was in the context of messy wrangling over whether Democrats should declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in their platform.","8292":"John Kerry, a muscle man of his own on Thursday night, gave the best answer to a tired question: \u201cAsk Osama bin Laden if he\u2019s better off than he was four years ago.\u201d","8293":"From my vantage point, the Democrats did a somewhat better job by this test. Bill Clinton is most of the reason. In his speech on Wednesday, he offered a skillful and detailed (if occasionally long-winded) argument for why Mr. Obama deserved to win on his record. On Thursday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered such an argument on behalf of Mr. Obama as well, although it was much more bluntly framed, with a focus on two of Mr. Obama\u2019s more popular accomplishments: the mission he authorized to kill Osama bin Laden, and his approval of the auto bailout.","8294":"Any decision to designate could have been seen as the product of pressure from a Congress angry with Pakistan over NATO supply lines negotiations and the fate of Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani who was jailed after helping the C.I.A. locate Osama bin Laden.","8295":"F.

Mr. Thau tried to ask one agent whether he believed the plot was linked to Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities suspect of masterminding the bombings of two American embassies in Africa in 1998, but Judge John F.

He's dead.).","8309":"But most critically for a Republican Party that often calls for a more robust military, neither Mitt Romney, the presidential nominee, nor his running mate, Representative Paul Ryan, had anything to say about the Afghan war at the convention. Mr. Romney did deem it important to discuss the threat posed by Iran, revealing that there is no recognition in Washington \u2014 on either the right or the left \u2014 that Afghanistan could be strategically vital in containing Iran. Like Mr. Romney, President Obama, too, is speaking little on the stump about the war, except to tout his decision to approve the mission that killed Osama bin Laden and his timetable to end the combat mission by 2014.","8311":"Mostafa Hussein, a psychiatrist and blogger, pointed to a photograph that showed that the protesters had also scrawled the name Osama bin Laden on a sign outside the embassy.","8312":"\u201cIt is instead a day to express gratitude to the men and women who have fought \u2014 and who are still fighting \u2014 to protect us and our country, including those who traced the trail of terror to that walled compound in Abbottabad and the SEALs who delivered justice to Osama bin Laden,\u201d he said.","8313":"This was above all a businesslike speech. Mr. Clinton did not dwell on Mr. Obama\u2019s character. He did not refer to the appointment of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as secretary of state. Nor did he offer any testimonials to the courage that Mr. Obama showed in ordering the raid on Osama bin Laden.","8314":"ASHWAUBENON, Wis. \u2014 Representative Paul D. Ryan accused the White House on Wednesday of leaking information that led to a 33-year prison sentence for a Pakistani doctor who helped American intelligence locate Osama bin Laden.","8315":"Others said the bold actions of the murderers in Libya \u2014 killing an American envoy for the first time in decades \u2014 reflected an administration that was viewed as weak, despite Mr. Obama\u2019s reportedly overseeing the killing of more top Qaeda leaders than former President George W.

Increasingly, it too has become reliant on regional and ethnic loyalties, in this case the loyalties of Pashtuns -- who make up the great majority of Taliban followers -- and in particular Pashtuns from the Kandahar region.","8320":"Simon Hanna, a journalist in Cairo, explained that a gathering of protesters in Tahrir Square, who carried a poster with the image of Osama bin Laden, numbered in the hundreds, while the pro-democracy protests in the same place in 2011 were attended by hundreds of thousands.","8321":"Rand Paul of Kentucky went further, saying he would block the bill until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden. He also wants to halt all American aid to Pakistan until Dr. Afridi is released. If that halts American aid to veterans, too bad.","8322":"\u201cIf President Obama were participating in his intelligence briefings on a regular basis then perhaps he would understand why people are so offended at his efforts to take sole credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden,\u201d former Vice President Dick Cheney said in an e-mail to The Daily Caller earlier this week. \u201cThe hubris of a president who believes he does not need to meet regularly with them is astounding,\u201d wrote Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, in The Washington Post.","8323":"The president\u2019s job approval rating of 51 percent among all Americans marks the first time he has surpassed a majority in the poll by The Times and CBS News since immediately after Osama bin Laden was killed, in May 2011. The number of adults who say the country is on the right track has increased to 40 percent, though 54 percent say it is on the wrong track.","8324":"\u201cAfter Obama\u2019s success in killing Osama bin Laden, in killing Qaddafi and in not blowing up Iraq, I think Obama and his aides figured, \u2018We\u2019ve got this box pretty well taken care of,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Michael Rubin, a Middle East scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Bush administration official, referring to Col.

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, went further, saying he would block the bill until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden.","833":"Meanwhile, most liberals and a few chastened radicals view the Sept. 11 attacks through the prism of World War II. For them, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban represent what the author Christopher Hitchens labels, 'fascism with an Islamic face.' Echoing the words of Mr. Bush, the anti-terrorist left maintains there is a moral imperative to defend a society that remains, whatever its flaws, a pillar of ethnic and religious pluralism and representative democracy.","8331":"Still, some young Kashmiris found it logical to blame the actions of the filmmaker on the United States. \u201cAfter all, Osama bin Laden\u2019s 9/11 was blamed on the entire Muslim world,\u201d said Junaid, 23, the third student. \u201cSam Bacile is one American, but then we can take it as all of America,\u201d he said.","8332":"In the week since the attack, the president of Libya\u2019s newly elected national Congress blamed foreign fighters from Algeria or Mali with links to Al Qaeda who he said entered the country months earlier to plan the assault. The Al Qaeda affiliate in North Africa praised the attack on Tuesday and urged more like it across the region. And in Washington, some Republicans have embraced that narrative, implicitly faulting the administration for prematurely declaring the demise of Al Qaeda with the killing of Osama bin Laden last year.","8333":"MR. ROMNEY: Don\u2019t worry. Given all those negative things, the fact that I\u2019m either tied or close to the president, and the fact that he\u2019s out there talking about the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Laden being captured, unemployment coming down, unleashing his campaign, we\u2019re still sort of tied? That\u2019s very interesting. Please.","8334":"The bill was opposed, by, among others, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who said he believed the bill duplicated existing job programs for veterans that are not well run, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has been seeking amendments on bills that would cut off funding to Egypt and to Pakistan until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden.","8335":"HEAD FOR THE BORDER: The new king of the hardcover nonfiction list is, no surprise, Mark Owen \u2014 or, as he\u2019s known to his friends (and the rest of America by now), Matt Bissonnette. A former member of the Navy SEALs, Bissonnette is the author of \u201cNo Easy Day,\u201d which enters the list at No. 1 and describes, among other things, his role in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The book (written with Kevin Maurer) has received admiring reviews \u2014 in the daily New York Times, Janet Maslin called it \u201can exciting, suspenseful account\u201d \u2014 but it has also stirred anger among special operations forces, who adhere proudly to a code of silence. Breaking it means Bissonnette is unlikely to be included in future SEAL reunions, one retired Navy officer told The Washington Times: \u201cThe guys who run their mouths are typically not invited back.\u201d But Bissonnette hasn\u2019t let the critics keep him down. He sat for a recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview (heavily disguised, inset) and told Scott Pelley the first thing he did upon returning from the mission was visit a Taco Bell drive-through.","8336":"As for Obama, he\u2019s been at his best when he has dared to lead without fearing the politics: taking out Osama bin Laden, securing health care without a public option, racing to the top in education and saving the banks rather than throwing all the bankers in jail, which they deserved. And he has been at his worst when he\u2019s put politics first: spurning Simpson-Bowles, doubling down on Afghanistan for fear of being called a wimp and dropping \u201cclimate change\u201d from his speeches.","8337":"The administration has decimated Al Qaeda and killed Osama bin Laden, but few say it\u2019s a war America has won. And Afghanistan has not produced a victory against the Taliban as the president prepares for a gradual withdrawal within two years.","8338":"A longtime political operative, Mr. Donilon has methodically reinvented himself as a maestro of international affairs, consolidating control of the national security apparatus in a corner West Wing office stacked with classified briefing books as thick as a fist. He oversaw support for the Libya war that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. He made sure surge troops left Afghanistan as scheduled. He is a champion of Mr. Obama\u2019s so-called pivot to Asia.","8339":"Just as quickly as he alluded to Mr. Carter\u2019s biggest foreign policy crisis, Mr. Ryan also asserted that a Romney-Ryan administration would follow a strategy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d \u2013 an equally plain reference to the national security motto Mr. Reagan favored. And yet it remains to be seen whether trying to gain ground on foreign policy will continue to be an uphill battle for the Republican ticket. While national security is a portfolio that has often favored the G.O.P. in recent elections, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the Obama administration\u2019s assassination program in Pakistan using drone-fired missiles may help explain the president\u2019s consistent polling advantage on the issue.","834":"The only problem with this otherwise laudable effort is that it doesn't hold up under inspection. The religious dimension of this conflict is central to its meaning. The words of Osama bin Laden are saturated with religious argument and theological language. Whatever else the Taliban regime is in Afghanistan, it is fanatically religious. Although some Muslim leaders have criticized the terrorists, and even Saudi Arabia's rulers have distanced themselves from the militants, other Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere have not denounced these acts, have been conspicuously silent or have indeed celebrated them. The terrorists' strain of Islam is clearly not shared by most Muslims and is deeply unrepresentative of Islam's glorious, civilized and peaceful past. But it surely represents a part of Islam -- a radical, fundamentalist part -- that simply cannot be ignored or denied.","8340":"THOSE who na\u00efvely believed that Osama bin Laden\u2019s death and America\u2019s forthcoming departure from Afghanistan would usher in a new era free of threats from Al Qaeda have been proved wrong.","8341":"And it is because of the progress that I\u2019ve witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I\u2019ve witnessed after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in Iraq is over. American troops have come home. We\u2019ve begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made -- from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan -- to put more power in the hands of citizens.","8342":"The Taliban also claimed that the vaccination campaign was a cover for American espionage, and referred to Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor hired by the Central Intelligence Agency to help track Osama bin Laden in early 2011, who had also worked on polio vaccination.","8343":"Her remarks added to the administration\u2019s evolving and at times muddled explanation of what happened on the evening of Sept. 11 and into the next morning.

(Whistleblower.org offers a good take on a similar topic.)","8345":"On the contrary, these techniques are unsafe, illegal and ineffective. The Romney campaign memo cited various claims that information obtained by torture was indispensable in saving American lives, including a misquotation \u2013 that then C.I.A. Director Leon Panetta said information obtained from waterboarding was crucial to finding and killing Osama bin Laden.","8346":"Assigning culpability also complicates the American response. For now, the administration awaits the F.B.I. investigation and updated intelligence reports. President Obama has said the United States will bring to justice those responsible for the attacks. But there is little appetite in the White House to launch drone strikes or a Special Operations raid, like the one that killed Osama bin Laden, in yet another Muslim country.","8347":"Everyone is frustrated by how long it takes to respond to an attack.

But they said they did not expect the attack to rob the president of his credibility on national security, contending that voters were far more likely to remember the raid on Osama bin Laden.","835":"After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Bush administration quickly named Osama bin Laden as the leading suspect. Since then, a worldwide investigation has established links between his organization, Al Qaeda (the Base), and previous attacks on American targets -- a largely circumstantial case that NATO is using to press for military action. James Barron and David Corcoran","8350":"Mr. Obama, of course, approved his own covert helicopter operation \u2014 and its risks were underscored when one helicopter crashed.

The president is trying to take credit for following the strategy and the tactics put into place by George W. Bush. At some point the president is going to have to explain why he was timid on the first two or three opportunities that we had. Thank goodness Hillary Clinton was there was to convince him to do the right thing.","8353":"In 1972, Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state under President Nixon, announced that \u201cpeace is at hand\u201d in the Vietnam War just days before the election. In 1992, Caspar Weinberger, the defense secretary during the Reagan administration when George H. W.

But administration officials say no decisions have been made on any potential targets.","8357":"W.\u2019s administration played up Al Qaeda ties, exploiting 9/11 to invade Iraq, which the neocons had wanted to do all along. The Obama administration sidestepped Al Qaeda ties in the case of the Libyan attack to perpetuate the narrative that the president had decimated Al Qaeda when Osama bin Laden was killed, and to preclude allegations that they were asleep at the switch on the anniversary of 9/11. Better to blame it all on a spontaneous protest to an anti-Islam video on YouTube.","8358":"The committed are already committed. (In some cases, really, really committed.

The development seems sure to revive the controversy over whether a dramatization of the 2011 raid so close to the voting could help President Obama\u2019s re-election chances. The raid is considered one of his signature achievements.","8361":"But near 12:30 pm, the students moved closer the convention center where the session was being held. A college student, who said he did not want to be identified to avoid any attention from the government, said the group was shouting slogans praising Osama bin Laden and the Taliban chief Mullah Muhammad Omar.","8362":"Orlean: On the other hand, I\u2019ve had a lot of people say to me, \u201cI was going to buy your book, but I can\u2019t stand it when the dog dies, so I\u2019m not going to read it.\u201d I think dogs have never been more valued than they seem to be right now. We\u2019re seeing them in all these roles. Therapy dogs and cancer dogs and dogs in Afghanistan and dogs killing Osama bin Laden. For a long time, police dogs (people thought they were nasty dogs), drug-sniffing dogs; now that we\u2019re all grown up, we think of these dogs as helpful and protective. They\u2019re in these roles that are ennobled.","8364":"Mr. Sudeikis worked on delivering Mr. Romney\u2019s list of 41 fixes for the economy (which included \u201csix abrupt reversals of opinion and three lies\u201d) in a modulated tone that allowed the Obama voice-over to be prominent. That was crucial because Mr. Downey had included a moment in which the moderator, Jim Lehrer, (played by a former cast member, Chris Parnell, in a guest appearance) interrupts to ask the president if he just heard Mr. Romney take credit for killing Osama bin Laden.","8365":"Acknowledging that Mr. Obama deserves credit for killing Osama bin Laden, he nonetheless criticized the president as lacking a comprehensive counterterrorism policy and failing to capitalize on the Arab Spring uprisings.","8366":"The Obama campaign appears eager to engage in foreign policy in the remaining weeks of the campaign, since campaign aides have long believed that Mr. Obama\u2019s record \u2014 which includes the killing of Osama bin Laden, the ending of the Iraq War, the announcement of a timeline to withdraw from Afghanistan, the toppling of the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi and a wariness to engage militarily in the myriad conflicts under way in the Middle East \u2014 are all far more in keeping with where the American public is now than Mr. Romney\u2019s positions are.","8367":"America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. These are real achievements won at a high cost. Al-Qaida remains a strong force, however, in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region. Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East.","8368":"One new element is Mr. Romney\u2019s assertion that the threats have \u201cgrown worse.\u201d He desperately wants to undercut the edge that voters have given Mr. Obama on foreign policy, even before he ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden. But he offers no real evidence to back up that particular claim, and if it were true that the threats have been so much worse for so long, it\u2019s odd that Mr. Romney hasn\u2019t really talked about them before.","8369":"But Mr. Romney\u2019s larger goal, his aides said, was to discuss missed opportunities in the Obama foreign policy and to argue that killing Osama bin Laden and conducting drone strikes in Pakistan at record rates does not constitute a strategy. \u201cThe greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East \u2014 friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us,\u201d he said.","8370":"The Zetas split off on their own two years ago and have fought their former allies and the Sinaloa Cartel, run by the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, known as El Chapo, or Shorty, who is wanted as badly here as Osama bin Laden once was by the United States.","8371":"The school was eventually forced to close, and Ms. Yousafzai was forced to flee to Abbottabad, the town where Osama bin Laden was killed last year. Months later, in summer 2009, the Pakistani Army launched a sweeping operation against the Taliban that uprooted an estimated 1.2 million Swat residents.","8372":"Obama feels: Seriously? After all he did mopping up Republican chaos, does he really have to spend weeks practicing a canned zinger? Should the man who killed Osama bin Laden and personally reviews drone strikes have to put on a show of macho swagger?","8373":"Soon after the attack, Congressional Republicans began accusing the administration of trying to play down the possibility that Al Qaeda\u2019s franchise in North Africa, or extremist groups with ties to it, were more involved in the assault than administration officials first acknowledged. They said the administration did not want to acknowledge the Qaeda links because it would detract from the message that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies had significantly weakened the terrorist network, especially since the Navy SEALs raid in Pakistan last year that killed Osama bin Laden.","8374":"The school was eventually forced to close, and Ms. Yousafzai was forced to flee to Abbottabad, the town where Osama bin Laden was killed last year. Months later, in summer 2009, the Pakistani Army began a sweeping operation against the Taliban that uprooted an estimated 1.2 million Swat residents.","8375":"The Romney-Ryan campaign senses an opening to undermine Mr. Obama\u2019s image of strength after killing Osama bin Laden by questioning if the administration was alert to terrorist threats that led to the death of the American ambassador in Libya.","8376":"When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president, the first day in office -- I was sitting with him in the Oval Office. He called in the CIA and signed an order saying, my highest priority is to get bin Laden.","8378":"But as Mr. Biden reminded Mr. Ryan that he and House Republicans cut the budget for the security, he sought to use the question about the attack in Libya to immediately begin the attack on Mr. Romney\u2019s positioning. He contrasted Mr. Obama\u2019s overall foreign policy record with Mr. Romney\u2019s, ranging from Iraq to the killing of Osama bin Laden.","8379":"The vice president tried to pivot from the messy aftermath of the Libya attack to a broader defense of Mr. Obama\u2019s record, describing him as having a \u201csteady hand\u201d and a \u201cclear vision.\u201d Mr. Obama, he said, kept his promise to end the war in Iraq and made the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden a top priority from his first day in office.","838":"The Bush administration needs to be cautious about what kinds of concessions it will make. Already, Washington appears to be deliberately, and wrongly, downplaying the issue of Russian human rights violations in Chechnya. Moscow has long claimed that Osama bin Laden and his allies have been training Chechen independence fighters, and it portrays the Chechen fighting as primarily a battle against radical Islamic terrorism. But the conflict between Russians and Chechens goes back centuries, and the two Russian military offensives there over the past decade have been accompanied by the brutal and widespread abuse of innocent civilians. Washington should continue to protest this inexcusable behavior.","8380":"Mr. Zawahri, an Egyptian-born preacher who became Al Qaeda\u2019s chief after the death of Osama bin Laden last year, also criticized President Obama after Democrats pledged during their convention to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.","8381":"A Romney supporter, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi called into question a fundamental claim of the Obama administration: that with the death of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda has been gravely weakened and Americans are safer.","8382":"Mr. Obama has been that rare Democrat who has scored well with the public on national security, according to polls, in part because of the raid he ordered that killed Osama bin Laden and his aggressive prosecution of the war against Al Qaeda through drone strikes in Pakistan. But the recent attack on an American diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the ambassador and three others has provided fodder to critics.","8383":"But Britain may also have held other attractions. While the United States and Pakistan have engaged in diplomatic warfare in recent years \u2014 over the Osama bin Laden raid, drone strikes and the controversy surrounding a Central Intelligence Agency contractor, Raymond Davis \u2014 Britain has carefully cultivated a less adversarial relationship.","8384":"The first time I talked to Mr. Ortiz on the phone he said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called. I\u2019ve been living in the Twilight Zone for the past three years.\u201d That was the spring of 2011. In the week between that call and when we met in person, Osama bin Laden was killed. When I went to the Bronx to meet Mr. Ortiz, people were high-fiving and congratulating him. I knew instantly I had to drop everything else and follow him around.","8385":"To Libyans who witnessed the assault and know the attackers, there is little doubt what occurred: a well-known group of local Islamist militants struck the United States Mission without any warning or protest, and they did it in retaliation for the video. That is what the fighters said at the time, speaking emotionally of their anger at the video without mentioning Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden or the terrorist strikes of 11 years earlier. And it is an explanation that tracks with their history as members of a local militant group determined to protect Libya from Western influence.","8386":"PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we\u2019ve gone through a tough four years; there\u2019s no doubt about it. But four years ago I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and I did. I told you I\u2019d cut taxes for small businesses, and I have. I said that I\u2019d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said we\u2019d refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after al-Qaida\u2019s leadership like never before, and Osama bin Laden is dead.","8387":"The story of Salim Hamdan, a Yemeni man who worked as a driver for Osama bin Laden and today won a significant court battle, is the story of how little President George W. Bush cared about the rule of law.","8388":"Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies had crushed the middle class, but Mr. Obama stated a list of his accomplishments, what he called promises kept, including killing Osama bin Laden and passing health care reform.","8389":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday overturned the terrorism conviction of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a former driver and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden whose case has been one of the most tangled to emerge from the war crimes trials of detainees held by the military at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.","839":"UNFRIENDLY GUERRILLAS -- A band of guerrillas trying to overthrow Uzbekistan's government poses a threat to the 1,000 American troops who just landed there. President Bush has said that the group, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, is linked to Osama bin Laden's organization. It is on a list of 27 international terrorist groups. B5","8390":"A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out the terrorism conviction of a high-profile former detainee at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, Salim Hamdan, a Yemeni who served as Osama bin Laden\u2019s driver and bodyguard and whose case led to a landmark 2006 Supreme Court ruling striking down the Bush administration\u2019s first version of military commissions.","8391":"Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies have crushed the middle class, but Mr. Obama stated a list of his accomplishments, including killing Osama bin Laden and passing health care reform.","8392":"\u00a0The attack and its aftermath has emerged as Mr. Obama\u2019s biggest source of foreign-policy vulnerability. Republicans have seized on it to undermine one of his administration\u2019s major accomplishments: its claim that it has dealt a grievous blow to Al Qaeda with attacks on Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders.","8394":"We also tend to forget that even the best considered and executed decisions may fail for reasons beyond a leader\u2019s control.\u00a0The SEAL unit raid that killed Osama bin Laden may well be credited to Obama\u2019s good judgment and careful planning.\u00a0But this judgment and planning could just as well have led to failure.\u00a0Conversely, President Carter\u2019s failed hostage rescue could, with better luck, have been a success.\u00a0He might then have gone on to win the 1980 election and, with an economic recovery at the end of his second term, now be judged a successful president (while Ronald Reagan would be just another also-ran whose brief adulation we would file under \u201cWhat were they thinking?\u201d).","8395":"The identity and motivation of the assailants have become an intense point of contention in the American presidential campaign. Republicans have sought to tie the attack to Al Qaeda to counter President Obama\u2019s assertion that by killing Osama bin Laden and other leaders his administration had crippled the group; Mr. Abu Khattala and Ansar al-Shariah share Al Qaeda\u2019s puritanism and militancy, but operate independently and focus only on Libya rather than on a global jihad against the West.","8396":"As the centerpiece of his national security record, Mr. Obama has highlighted his administration\u2019s aggressive efforts against militants in Pakistan and Yemen, as well as the successful raid to kill Osama bin Laden. Some of his top aides have suggested that Al Qaeda has been decimated by the American strikes. Republicans have seized on the Benghazi attack \u2014 which resulted in the first killing of an American ambassador in decades \u2014 to counter this Democratic line, suggesting that the administration has exaggerated its success against Al Qaeda and has pursued policies that have left the Middle East in chaos.","8398":"Mr. Storm\u2019s tale shows the lengths to which American intelligence officials went to hunt down Mr. Awlaki, a leader of Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Yemen who some counterterrorism officials believed posed a greater threat to the United States than Osama bin Laden did. Their method was a variation on the traditional so-called honey trap, in which spy services use the lure of sex to ensnare male targets. Mr. Awlaki had been arrested during his years as an imam in the United States for hiring prostitutes; his two Arab wives lived apart from him in 2010, and he had asked Mr. Storm to find him a European woman willing to stay with him in hiding.","8399":"Drones or SEALs: Those were the options President Obama and his advisers considered in the days before the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. If they obliterated Osama bin Laden with a missile, they would have difficulty proving he was dead. The SEALs would be able to show they got him, but if things went badly they themselves might be killed. Either option was risky since the odds, as the president saw them, were only \u201c50-50\u201d that Bin Laden was even there. So a deputy national security adviser, Benjamin Rhodes, was asked to compose different speeches \u2014 one for a successful raid, the other for a botched one.","84":"Although the Taliban government is not recognized by United Nations members who will again consider what do with the Afghanistan next month, it is treated as the de facto government by United Nations agencies, which run programs there. Afghanistan is also under Security Council sanctions for refusing to turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born militant, to American courts.","840":"Almost half of the men said they were from Afghanistan -- many were refugees. Many of them expressed disdain for the United States and a willingness to fight for Osama bin Laden.","8400":"I thought of the men on the C-130 that night while reading \u201cNo Easy Day,\u201d the first-person account of the raid last year that killed Osama bin Laden. The author, writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen \u2014 his real name is Matt Bissonnette \u2014 was a member of the SEALs for 10 years before he went on the mission to kill Bin Laden. The raid on Abbottabad, Pakistan, is the heart of \u201cNo Easy Day,\u201d and it makes for a thrilling narrative. Still, in nearly 300 pages of what amounts to a memoir of his life as a SEAL, Bissonnette does not report a single twitch of conscience, barely a moment of reflection, not a twinge of regret. He does not appear to question, even for a moment, why he is in these countries, hunting down these men. He\u2019s a killing machine.","8401":"For his part, Mr. Obama is a man who tends to live in the moment, reacting to the world\u2019s problems while trying to define an emerging Obama doctrine, though it is a phrase the president never utters. To Mr. Obama, that unipolar moment is a gauzy memory. Those longing for it are pining for a global order that cannot exist again. The essence of Mr. Obama\u2019s approach has been that the United States will act unilaterally whenever its direct interests are threatened \u2014 think of the Osama bin Laden raid or of the drone strikes and cyberattacks. But he has hesitated to act in cases where he believes others have greater interests at stake than we do: thus America\u2019s halfhearted commitment to the military effort to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, and its refusal to take a major role in ousting President Bashar al-Assad from Syria.","8402":"The early line is that this is an opportunity for Mr. Obama to shine, and to repair the damage from the first debate. (He was already telling jokes the other night, at a dinner in New York, about his frequent mention of Osama bin Laden\u2019s demise.)","8403":"And so what we\u2019re seeing is a \u2014 a \u2014 a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course, the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And \u2014 and we\u2019re going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. I congratulate him on \u2014 on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaida. But we can\u2019t kill our way out of this mess. We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the \u2014 the world of Islam and \u2014 and other parts of the world reject this radical violent extremism which is \u2014 it\u2019s really not on the run. It\u2019s certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.","8404":"At tonight\u2019s debate, Mitt Romney will almost certainly criticize President Obama, again, over Benghazi. Republicans seem to have settled on the attack there as the greatest national security failure of our time (a rather odd notion in the post-9/11 world), perhaps because they think it distracts voters from the fact that, as the vice president likes to say, General Motors is alive and Osama bin Laden is dead.","8405":"Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers have long believed that the president\u2019s success in making good on some crucial promises \u2014 leaving Iraq, winding down in Afghanistan and killing Osama bin Laden \u2014 has earned him broad support when it comes to foreign policy leadership.","8406":"Mr. Obama pressed his case for removing Mr. Qaddafi from power. \u201cImagine if we had pulled out at that point,\u201d he said at the debate, noting that Mr. Qaddafi \u201chad more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.","8407":"President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing, \u201cIf we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.\u201d But if Pakistan can\u2019t be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he\u2019d deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years.","8408":"Mr. Obama benefits, too, from Americans\u2019 weariness with the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Mr. Bush initiated. By winding them down \u2014 and by succeeding where Mr. Bush failed in hunting down Osama bin Laden \u2014 Mr. Obama has lately won higher marks from voters on foreign policy than on his job performance over all.","8409":"Mr. Maayta said the group had taken \u201ccounsel from Al Qaeda in Iraq via the terrorist sites on the Internet,\u201d and had posted its plans online \u201cto enable others to be able to create the same explosives.\u201d Al Qaeda in Iraq is a Sunni insurgent group named after the organization founded by Osama bin Laden, and American intelligence officials have described it as being made up of mostly homegrown Iraqis, with limited foreign leadership.","841":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6\u2014 In the late 1980's, an American-based agent for Al Qaeda, the terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden, shipped to Afghanistan 25 military-style rifles capable of shooting down helicopters, piercing armor or destroying fuel tanks from long distances, according to a report by a gun control organization.","8410":"Instead, he tried to broaden his critique, praising the president\u2019s counterterrorism efforts but quickly pivoting to call for a more comprehensive strategy to diminish radicalism in the Middle East. \u201cI congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in Al Qaeda,\u201d Mr. Romney said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t kill our way out of this mess.\u201d","8411":"Mr. Obama hit Mr. Romney hard on his ever-shifting positions on world affairs, including comments he made in 2008 disparaging the idea that killing Osama bin Laden should be a priority. \u201cYou said we should ask Pakistan for permission,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten it.\u201d","8412":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Thanks to the magic of editing, President Obama will have a starring role in a television drama about one of his biggest accomplishments \u2014 the killing of Osama bin Laden \u2014 that will be shown just two nights before the presidential election.","8413":"Pakistan was a major focus of the debate, although the candidates seemed to largely agree on American policy there. Mr. Romney endorsed the killing of Osama bin Laden and the Obama administration\u2019s increased use of drone strikes against suspected Taliban and Qaeda militants in the tribal areas.","8414":"Excerpts from an English translation, which is said to run 220 pages, were filed on Wednesday evening in federal court by lawyers for another Qaeda figure, Wadih El-Hage, a naturalized American citizen from Lebanon who had worked as a close aide to Osama bin Laden.","8415":"In 2002 and 2003, with Sept. 11 still haunting the news, he painted three identically framed head-shot portraits: of a smiling, plump-faced Osama bin Laden; a blank George W.

I\u2019d add, however, that the killing of Osama bin Laden mattered too. Foreign policy hasn\u2019t been a big issue in this election, but that in itself is a big gain for Democrats compared with the usual taunt that they\u2019re weak on terrorism or whatever; notice how hard Romney has tried to restart the usual meme, with negative success.","8417":"Mr. Obama and his administration have been resolute in attacking Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. He has ended the war in Iraq. Mr. Romney, however, has said he would have insisted on leaving thousands of American soldiers there. He has surrounded himself with Bush administration neocons who helped to engineer the Iraq war, and adopted their militaristic talk in a way that makes a Romney administration\u2019s foreign policies a frightening prospect.","8418":"But there is an important distinction: most of the newer jihadist groups have local agendas, and very few aspire to strike directly at the United States as Osama bin Laden\u2019s core network did. They may interfere with American interests around the world \u2014 as in Syria, where the presence of militant Islamists among the rebels fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad has inhibited American efforts to support the uprising. But that is a far cry from terrorist plots aimed at the United States itself.","8419":"This tendency is reinforced by the publication of an interview with him in the new issue of The Atlantic magazine. In an eyebrow-arching exchange, the mayor was asked if President Obama deserved credit for ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden last year.","8420":"\u2022 In the waning days of the 2004 election, the race was upended by the release of a video of Osama bin Laden telling the American people, \u201cYour security is not in the hands of Kerry or Bush or Al Qaeda; your security is in your own hands.\u201d Some analysts believed that its release helped President George W. Bush win re-election, by putting the focus on terrorism just before people went to the polls.","8421":"The first time I talked to Mr. Ortiz on the phone he said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called.

On Thursday the Senate Intelligence Committee finally approved, by a 9-6 party-line vote, a 6,000-page report on C.I.A. detention and interrogation\u2014but it remains classified. Among other things, the report reviews claims that tortured prisoners provided vital intelligence that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden \u2013 claims Republicans make to this day to justify the brutality they supported for years, but which virtually everyone else disputes, including those how actually conducted those interrogations. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the intelligence committee, has said that information obtained from torture victims did not play a major role in hunting down Mr. bin Laden, but she did not have much to say yesterday about the report\u2014because it remains classified. Republicans attacked the report as flawed and incomplete, like they do whenever a report makes their team look bad. Ms. Feinstein, however, said it covered every detainee held by the C.I.A., \u201cthe conditions under which they were detained, how they were interrogated, the intelligence they actually provided and the accuracy or inaccuracy of C.I.A. descriptions about the program to the White House, Department of Justice, Congress and others.\u201d The report has 35,000 footnotes and covers more than 6 million pages of records, Ms. Feinstein said.

I\u2019m guessing, not many. No decision was made yesterday about releasing the report and it will not be made until after the committee receives comments from the executive branch, Ms. Feinstein said, a euphemism for allowing the administration a chance to heavily censor the document. Meanwhile, the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay remains open, an indelible stain on the American justice system. There is no plausible reason to keep the prison open. In late November, Ms. Feinstein released a study by the Government Accountability Office that said prison facilities in the United States currently hold 373 people convicted of terrorism and could handle the remaining 166 prisoners at Guantanamo. The federal justice system could at least provide them with the fair trial that the military tribunals created by Mr. Bush and slightly improved by Mr. Obama have failed to give them. There has been no official accounting of the Bush administration\u2019s detention policies, and perhaps there never will be \u2013 because in 2009, when he took office, President Obama decided to sweep that whole period of lawlessness and brutality under the rug.

The three \u2014 Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California; Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan; and John McCain, Republican of Arizona \u2014 called on Sony to \u201cconsider correcting the impression that the C.I.A.\u2019s use of coercive interrogation techniques led to the operation\u201d against Bin Laden, but they do not explain exactly how that could be done.","849":"The unspoken message behind Mr. Tenet's memorandum was that the bureaucracy had grown too rigid in recent years, complicating the ability of intelligence agencies to confront a rapidly evolving threat like that posed by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his network. In effect, Mr. Tenet's memo echoed many of the sentiments voiced by the C.I.A.'s critics since Sept. 11.","8490":"\u2605 \u2018Zero Dark Thirty\u2019 (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid.

In the latest CBS News poll, the president\u2019s job approval rating was at 57 percent.","8496":"New polls suggest that Mr. Obama\u2019s popularity has surged to its highest point since he announced the killing of Osama bin Laden. In the latest CBS News survey, the president\u2019s job approval rating was at 57 percent.","8497":"The acting director of the C.I.A., Michael J. Morell, has criticized a new movie about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, saying it exaggerates the role of coercive interrogations in producing clues to the whereabouts of the leader of Al Qaeda.","8498":"For 11 years, the United States has pursued its national security interests in Afghanistan: hunting Osama bin Laden, stamping out a Qaeda sanctuary, fighting against the return of the Taliban.","8499":"A police reporter in New York for 20 years for various television stations, he was hired by William Bratton, New York\u2019s police commissioner, in 1994 as a deputy commissioner. He went back to reporting at ABC in 1995 and became co-anchor of \u201c20/20,\u201d where he interviewed Osama bin Laden. He wrote a book on the Sept. 11 attacks and then went back to work for Mr. Bratton in 2003, this time in Los Angeles as head of the counterterrorism and criminal intelligence bureau, along with the major crimes division.","85":"The dispute comes just three months before Mr. el-Hage and five co-defendants are to stand trial on allegations that they were part of a terrorist conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden. The government said the conspiracy was behind the bombings of embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in August 1998. More than 200 people died in the bombings, while thousands more were wounded.","850":"Similarly, the other countries Mr. Rumsfeld visited did not grant permission for the United States to carry out strikes directly from their soil, at least not publicly. Still, the administration insisted that it had what it needed -- overflight rights, limited basing rights and open political support -- to wage what it conceded would be a protracted war against Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and its hosts in Afghanistan.","8500":"Nearly 10,000 men and women from the 101st Airborne, a third of the active-duty troops based here, are either in Afghanistan or getting ready to go. Still more parents here have been deployed with units like the Fifth Special Forces Group and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers, whose members piloted the helicopters in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","8501":"So, when the Central Intelligence Agency admitted sponsoring a hepatitis vaccination campaign as a ruse to get into a compound in Pakistan to confirm that Osama bin Laden was there, and the White House said it had contemplated wiping out the residence with a drone missile, it was not far-fetched for Taliban leaders to assume that other vaccinators worked for the drone pilots.","8502":"But he settled into the first film, as usual, in one of the rear rows, and tucked his left foot comfortably up on the seat and became gripped by the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","8503":"\u2605 \u2018Zero Dark Thirty\u2019 (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid.

What psychological forces from her past drive her? We never find out. Is she in a relationship? Tiptoe toward that conversation, as one character does, and get shut down.","8506":"Third, religious zealots like Osama bin Laden, and their \u201csense of God,\u201d have caused a very large share of the world\u2019s wars.","851":"Pakistan, the front line state with the most to gain or lose in Afghanistan as the United States pursues Osama bin Laden, is another case in point. It has already won a lifting of sanctions and promises of international financial aid -- to the consternation of India, which until Sept. 11 reveled in the sense that it finally had gained the upper hand in South Asian relations with Washington. Now, prominent Pakistanis have been saying that in exchange for cooperation against the Taliban, they want the United States to help India and Pakistan resolve their own most intractable dispute, over Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state.","852":"Embarrassed by their impotence in stopping the Sept. 11 attack, the freaked-out F.B.I. and C.I.A. now cover themselves by issuing blanket warnings, telling Congress there is a strong chance America will be attacked again by Islamic sleeper agents once we retaliate against Osama bin Laden, and revealing to CNN that they are picking up the same patterns and language -- 'You will be happy soon' -- from terrorists under surveillance that were prevalent before Sept. 11.","853":"The last time the allied groups held power, in the early 1990's, the situation became so chaotic that the Taliban found an opening to come to power, promising to restore order to the nation with their strict interpretation of Islam. Now the Taliban are accused of harboring Osama bin Laden.","854":"Putting additional menace into that threat, the Taliban announced today that it would release eight aid workers on trial for promoting Christianity in Kabul -- but only if the United States 'stops issuing threats' of military action in support of its demand for the handover of Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.","855":"President Bush has a clear political goal: the eradication of the AlQaeda terrorist network and the toppling of the Taliban regime that supports it. But before the Pentagon has fired a single missile at Osama bin Laden or his hosts in Afghanistan, it has signaled that its military planning is guided by an entirely new set of rules.","856":"The president could not find the right words. Soon after the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked on Sept. 11, he tried to articulate his response. In one week he gave more than a dozen speeches and remarks to comfort, rally and then -- when he'd rallied too much -- calm the country. To some, his language seemed undisciplined. He called the terrorists 'folks' and referred to the coming battle as a 'crusade.' He called for 'revenge,' called Osama bin Laden the 'prime suspect' and asked for him 'dead or alive.' He said 'make no mistake' at least eight times in public remarks. When Bush didn't seem lost, he often seemed scared. When he didn't seem scared, he often seemed angry. None of this soothed the public. 'It was beginning to look like 'Bring Me the Head of Osama bin Laden,' starring Ronald Colman,' one White House official remembered.","857":"A Syrian businessman in Germany who is under investigation for possible links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers had closer ties to top aides of Osama bin Laden than was previously known, court records show.","858":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6\u2014 For all the emphasis that Pentagon planners have put on Special Operations forces in a war against the network of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government, at the moment relatively few of these secretive soldiers are within striking distance of the heart of Afghanistan, officials at the Pentagon say.","859":"JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 6\u2014 The faith that drives Osama bin Laden and his followers is a particularly austere and conservative brand of Islam known as Wahhabism, which was instrumental in creating the Saudi monarchy, and if sufficiently alienated, could tear it down.","86":"An Orlando, Fla., man who prosecutors say is a member of an organization led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was refused bail yesterday after a federal judge in Manhattan concluded he might flee before his trial. The defendant, Ihab M. Ali, was recently charged with perjury and criminal contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the bombings of two United States embassies in Africa in 1998. Mr. Ali was jailed for 16 months after being found in civil contempt for refusing, on religious grounds, to testify. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","860":"Q. -- How solid is the evidence that Osama bin Laden orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?","861":"But throughout the region, Arabs and other Muslims were glued to Al Jazeera television, the widely watched satellite station based in Qatar, which broadcast over and over its dramatic tape of Osama bin Laden, pitting the struggle of Islam against the West. Mr. bin Laden's stark challenge to the United States, which he pronounced a target for all true Muslims because of its alleged killing of Iraqi civilians and backing for Israel against Palestinians, was interspersed with coverage from inside Afghanistan, largely flashes in the dark.","862":"QUESTION. -- Was Osama bin Laden targeted in this raid? And can you give us -- I understand it's still early -- any preliminary assessment of how successful these attacks were?","863":"Following is a videotaped statement by Osama bin Laden broadcast yesterday by Al Jazeera in Qatar, as translated from the Arabic by Reuters.","864":"For three weeks Mr. Bush had issued ultimatums, threats to capture Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive' and warnings to Americans that they were in for a long war. Today, when he finally delivered the message that the action had begun, he and his aides chose the locale for the announcement with care: the Treaty Room of the White House, 'a place where American presidents have worked for peace,' he said -- and, conveniently, a place with windows that looked out on a brilliant day in Washington. It helped, his aides said, that as he spoke viewers could see cars zipping by the window behind him and someone flying a kite in front of the Jefferson Memorial.","865":"Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist leader, made it clear once again, on videtape, that he would not back off. The tape, date uncertain, was broadcast on Arabic satellite television. He challenged the allied efforts to picture him as a renegade who has corrupted the teaching of his faith, describing the American war against him as a war against Afghanistan and Islam. As long as it continues, he promised, Americans 'will never taste security.'","866":"Standing in sunlight somewhere, Osama bin Laden was saying through an interpreter, 'One day we will answer this degradation,' alluding to the bombing.","867":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7\u2014 Striking at night from aircraft carriers and distant bases, the United States and Britain launched a powerful barrage of cruise missiles and long-range bombers against Afghanistan today to try to destroy the terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network and the Taliban government that has protected it.","868":"LOS ANGELES\u2014 'America is full of fear,' crowed a jubilant Osama bin Laden, in his taped message anticipating our response to his massacre of the six thousand. 'They cry for their children.'","869":"Attempts to understand Osama bin Laden in terms of American support for Israel or rampant poverty in the Middle East will be illusionary. Values that are dear to us, like regional peace in the Middle East or a socially just division of wealth, are not dear to Osama bin Laden, and terrorists aim to achieve the antithesis of these things when they use extreme measures.","87":"But Judge Sand said that in light of legal precedent and the nature of the investigation of Osama bin Laden, the suspected leader, and his organization, al-Qaeda, 'Mr. el-Hage's speculations about the government's motives are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity.'","870":"Having supported Saddam Hussein in the gulf war and having seen some of their own international backing collapse as a result, Palestinians want to avoid the same problem. But many also sympathize with Osama bin Laden.","871":"He said the European Union deplored the failure of the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden despite repeated appeals that it do so.","872":"We ought to be concerned about the clandestine outbursts of Muslims in the United States who sympathize with the Palestinians, with the fanatic Muslim clergy or with the likes of Osama bin Laden (whom many see as a charismatic and courageous leader, not a fanatic terrorist).","873":"The more difficult task will be hunting down Osama bin Laden and helping the anti-Taliban foes within Afghanistan install a new government. In effect, the airstrikes were a conventional start to an entirely unconventional conflict.","874":"Part of the problem was that the networks have not had an easy time stationing people in Taliban-held Afghanistan, so reports from the ground there were hard to come by. All of the networks were helped by Al Jazeera, an Arab-language, 24-hour news channel. It had what was thought to be the only satellite uplink in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and all the networks showed its images of antiaircraft fire over the city. Later, it showed a video message from Osama bin Laden to the Muslim world, the first such video to be shown since Sept. 11. That, too, was carried by all the news networks.","875":"Since the attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, the Northern Alliance has become a chief focus of American-led efforts to topple the militant Islamic Taliban government that harbors the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden.","876":"BRONXVILLE, N.Y.\u2014 For Muslims of the Middle East and south and central Asia, the moment of reckoning arrived yesterday. The Bush administration has made what are, for an American government, extraordinary efforts to show that the war that began Sept. 11 will not be the war Osama bin Laden wants: a battle between Islam and the rest of the world, particularly the United States. Whether Muslims in the region accept, encourage and further this American effort will determine much of their fate in coming years. It will also determine how effective the war against terrorism will be.","877":"Leading American scholars and practitioners of Islam said yesterday that Osama bin Laden had twisted and debased Muslim theology in a videotaped statement in which he called on 'every Muslim' to 'rush to make his religion victorious' by emulating those who attacked the United States on Sept. 11.","878":"But with retaliatory strikes a possibility somewhere in America as a long campaign unfolds against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government in Kabul, the mayor said that many security measures taken in recent weeks would become part of the fabric of life in the region for weeks or months to come, and he urged people to get used to them.","879":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 7\u2014 Within hours of the first American bombs' dropping on Afghanistan, the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden, appeared in a videotape broadcast worldwide in which he taunted the United States and celebrated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","88":"But according to the State Department, several radical Islamic organizations operate in Yemen. They include the Palestinian group known as Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and cells linked to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi whom American officials blamed for the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998. The United States retaliated for those bombings 13 days later with missile strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan.","880":"But some industry experts said the Saturday attack might be a hint of the growing restiveness in Muslim countries as their leaders side with the West against Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden.","881":"And so it began. With long-range bombers and cruise missiles, the anticipated attack on Afghanistan got under way, the goal being to destroy Osama bin Laden's terrorist training camps and to get rid of his Taliban protectors. 'Now the Taliban will pay a price,' President Bush said.","882":"For the majority of those interviewed, the air campaign ushered in a deep sense of foreboding that seemed to replace last month's horror and shock. No matter how obvious the retaliation had been, no matter how clearly it had been signaled from Washington, some people still carried a dim hope that Osama bin Laden might be caught and a full-scale military strike avoided.","883":"ASSAULT AGAINST AFGHANISTAN -- Striking at night, from aircraft carriers and distant bases, the United States and Great Britain launched a barrage of cruise missiles and long-range bombers against Afghanistan to try to destroy the terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden's movement, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban military that has protected it. A1","884":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7\u2014 United States investigators say they have determined that Osama bin Laden's top three lieutenants helped plan the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","885":"A wave of B-52 bombers dropped streams of huge unguided bombs across several training camps in the Baghlan Province north of Kabul that the officials said had recently been used by terrorist groups, including Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Though terrorists are likely to have fled in advance of the strikes, one senior military official said the camps had buildings and equipment worth destroying and military commanders chose a tactic intended to create widespread devastation.","886":"Pakistan, the only nation that still recognizes the Taliban government, was unsuccessful in efforts to broker a deal for the Afghan rulers to turn over Osama bin Laden, as the United States had demanded.","887":"Jeph Loeb, who writes another Superman comic for DC, argues that in the age of 24-hour television news, having the Man of Steel hunt down Osama bin Laden would feel false in a way that superheroes fighting Nazis did not.","888":"Time has not run out for the Taliban, which had been resigned to an American attack, but it has for the United States now that it has committed itself to a military solution. Killing Osama bin Laden may give immediate satisfaction, but it will do nothing to remedy, and will undoubtedly increase, the deep despair and hatred of the Muslim underclass -- the fertile ground that feeds terrorism.","889":"If the United States and its allies can quickly oust the Taliban, capture Osama bin Laden, and uproot his terrorist network, the odds of a deep recession will drop significantly. A victory will help consumer and business confidence, making companies more willing to invest and consumers more ready to spend. The travel industry, hard-hit, might see the greatest gains. 'A lot depends on the result of the attack,' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment officer for Advest.","89":"Other experts suggested that Osama bin Laden, who the United States believes was behind the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998, comes from an ethnically Yemeni family and has influence there, as does Iraq. The American ships refueling in Aden, which are part of the Fifth Fleet, largely help enforce the sanctions against Iraq.","890":"As President Bush rightly emphasized in his brief television address, these military actions represent just one front in a wider campaign that also includes diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement. Getting the proper balance will be complicated, and maintaining it will involve both skill and national self-control. To that end, initial military action should be carefully directed at the reasonable objectives Mr. Bush proclaimed yesterday -- to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base and to weaken the military capability of that country's ruling Taliban movement, which allows Osama bin Laden and his network to operate there.","891":"In a speech from 10 Downing Street, Mr. Blair forcefully depicted Britain's role as not simply joining a coalition against Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and supporters but rather as acting in Britain's national interest.","892":"The airstrikes on Taliban sites began what officials said would be a weeklong campaign, but Osama bin Laden was not a target. PAGE B4","893":"As President Bush rightly emphasized in his brief television address, these military actions represent just one front in a wider campaign that also includes diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement.

Lauding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. bin Laden vowed that 'America will not live in peace' as long as the goals of his group remain unmet. The tape had been left at the network's satellite uplink station in Kabul, said a spokesman for Al Jazeera.","896":"Despite assertions that satire and black comedy had become obsolete, Will Ferrell was back last weekend doing his President Bush impersonation on 'Saturday Night Live,' the satirical weekly The Onion was up and running with headlines like 'U.S. Vows to Defeat Whoever It Is We're at War With' and 'Rest of Country Temporarily Feels Deep Affection for New York,' and jokes about Osama bin Laden were circulating by e-mail. (One suggested that he be captured and punished by being given a complete sex change operation: 'Then we return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.')","897":"IF we assume the worst about Osama bin Laden (and why shouldn't we?), it is rational to fear that his video harangue broadcast on Sunday was a signal for another terrorist attack. In that case, which of the following would have been the most rational course of action yesterday for a person with a desire not to die?","898":"PLOT AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA -- American officials said Osama bin Laden plans to attack Saudi Arabia in an effort to oust the royal family. B4","899":"I believe that it would be appropriate to capture Osama bin Laden and the leadership of Al Qaeda and have them tried before an international court for their criminal acts, with the whole world watching, as was done with Adolf Eichmann. This would have a far greater deterrent effect on terrorism than giving them the martyrdom they surely see as one of their last options.","9":"Federal prosecutors, in a series of little-noticed court filings, have painted the most detailed picture yet of how Osama bin Laden directed what they depict as a worldwide terrorism conspiracy. The government has charged Mr. bin Laden with conspiring to attack Americans, specifically in the embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya. 1","90":"In May The Times reported that FAIR had run ads in Michigan suggesting that Senator Spencer Abraham's pro-immigration stance would make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to attack America. Such preposterous ads clearly spring from a sense of desperation among anti-immigration groups. Stoking anti-immigration rage is not an easy task when the nation's unemployment rate has dipped below 4 percent, and when the job market is eagerly seeking not only cheap labor for menial tasks but also skilled foreigners to keep the high-tech revolution in gear. Indeed, last week Congress voted to nearly double the number of visas for foreign workers with high-tech skills.","900":"Several hours after General Pervez made his remarks, officers close to him said he had not intended to be taken literally when speaking of the airstrikes ending so quickly. Rather, they said, what he meant was that 'the visible' part of United States and British strikes over Afghan cities, where live television coverage of explosions in the night sky are relayed around the world, should be concluded quickly, in any event no longer than a week or 10 days, while other 'invisible' air operations to disrupt hideouts and strongholds of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda continued.","901":"With his turban and camouflage jacket, his ornate Arabic and harsh vows of continued terror against America, Osama bin Laden revealed in his speech the instinctive cunning that has made him such a formidable foe.","902":"'I think it's important that we aren't afraid,' said Tim Amuchastegui, 50, a contractor from Klamath Falls, Ore. 'Osama bin Laden has done what he's done and he may do more. We came all the way across the country to show support for New York.'","903":"The order has resulted in the arrest of many immigrants suspected of involvement with groups linked to Osama bin Laden. But it has also met with resistance from F.B.I. agents who believed that surveillance -- if continued for days or weeks -- might turn up critical evidence to prove who orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","904":"The United States attacked more targets like airfields, terrorist camps and Defense Ministry offices. But it did so with less than half the number of bombers, fighter planes and Tomahawk cruise missiles that were used on Sunday at the start of this operation to uproot Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and unseat the Taliban government that shields him.","905":"Re 'Extremism's Theological Roots,' by Mark Lilla (Op-Ed, Oct. 7): In a world without religion, Osama bin Laden and his kind would still exist, invoking some other ideology to justify their atrocities. Religion, because it is so open to interpretation, is a convenient place for a killer to hang his hat, but the ugliness in his heart is what drives him.","906":"While President Bush has vowed to hunt down Osama bin Laden, another crucial goal has been to pave the way for anti-Taliban rebels who are trying to overthrow Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme Taliban leader.","907":"As much as Hitler during World War II or Nikita S. Khrushchev in the cold war, Osama bin Laden has emerged as the enemy incarnate for an America fighting Islamic terrorism. Soon after President Bush declared he wanted Mr. bin Laden 'dead or alive,' in cowboy parlance, shooting ranges in the United States began selling targets of this bearded, turban-clad villain. Mr. bin Laden appeared to relish the role, judging by the tape of himself declaring holy war that was broadcast by the Pan-Arab Al Jazeera cable network after American and British forces launched air strikes on Afghanistan.","908":"There are the handwritten signs everywhere on the trading floor, labeling the booths by number and showing the locations of restrooms, as well as a few fliers containing unprintable sentences about Osama bin Laden.","909":"Spain and Italy joined France and Germany in pledging to send troops, if necessary. NATO agreed to send five Awacs early warning planes and crews to the United States to free up American surveillance aircraft for use in the campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.","910":"In sending his own police against a crowd of some 2,000 Palestinians, Yasir Arafat appeared to make a clear choice in the international battle against terror: he is with the United States, and against Osama bin Laden. But, on a day when Mr. Arafat, like many other Arab leaders, enveloped himself in silence, it was not clear why he had decided to act as he did.","911":"Mr. Hahn said in a statement today that the emphasis on security was partly a response to the prospect of terrorist attacks. The airport was the target of a foiled plot in 1999, an effort linked to agents of Osama bin Laden, and there has been great concern here about a second attempt.","912":"But if only time will salve their wounds, the military retaliation has comforted some grieving families by reaffirming that their losses, and now their own sacrifices, have not been forgotten. These families say that they have focused their anger on Osama bin Laden and his terrorists, in part, because there is little else they can do.","913":"He said that President Bush 'should use any legitimate means to go after the perpetrators.' But he cautioned that the quest for justice could cause the United States to itself be unjust. 'If we kill innocents, we create the conditions for another Osama bin Laden. Don't seek vengeance; seek justice.'","914":"Jordan has banned demonstrations for much of this year because of boiling sentiments over violence in the Palestinian territories, but the reaction there was also one of anger. 'Such acts are blind because the U.S. does not have any specific or strategic targets,' said Mahmoud Kharabsheh, an independent member of Parliament, dismayed about the lack of published evidence against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. 'If the U.S. possessed concrete evidence, it would have disclosed it to the world in order to convince them that they are the perpetrators. But what happened is only a cover for a crusader attempt to conquer the Arab and Islamic world.'","915":"The military strike against Afghanistan came as no surprise here because the diplomatic groundwork for cooperation was carefully laid by Washington and London. One day after the attacks in the United States, the Security Council adopted a resolution condemning them, and then passed another, on Sept. 28, obliging all 189 member countries to crack down on the financing, training and movement of terrorists. The Council also invoked earlier resolutions that assailed the Taliban for sheltering Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks.","916":"The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was apparently holed up in a bunker, he said, and the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, who is believed to have orchestrated the Sept. 11 terror attacks on America, remained unknown. There was no independent means of confirming those claims, which repeated earlier unconfirmed reports from Pakistani intelligence and other sources.","917":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 8\u2014 In recent months, Osama bin Laden and his allies have planned attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia as part of their continuing effort to oust the Saudi royal family, American officials said today.","918":"She asked if the strikes would ferret out Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the East Coast. Or would they cripple the Taliban, the ruling fundamentalist militia? Or both?","919":"I am not sure all our coalition partners in the war against Osama bin Laden understand that. The truth is, our real coalition partners can be counted on a few fingers: the British, France, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan. The Saudis, Egyptians and Syrians are not, and will not be, members of this coalition in any equal sense -- not because they don't have military power to contribute, but because deep down these Arab regimes do not share the values that we're trying to defend.","92":"Still, the officials said they had not ruled out any one of several other known terrorist groups, including followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom American officials blamed for the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","920":"John Cimaglia almost did not attend yesterday's Columbus Day parade up Fifth Avenue. So, yes, the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the four difficult weeks that followed, punctuated by Sunday's televised images of Osama bin Laden promising more havoc for the United States, have unnerved him a little, making him wary, invading his dreams.","922":"'I anticipate it is more likely a matter of days rather than weeks,' Mr. Hoon told BBC television. 'This is the first phase of our attacks on the Taliban regime, on bringing Osama bin Laden to account.'","923":"But in dismissing powerful aides who helped bring him to power two years ago and managed Pakistan's close ties to the Taliban, he has added kindling to a highly combustible political climate. As President Bush prosecutes his campaign against terrorism and Osama bin Laden, he must be mindful of General Musharraf's fragile position.","924":"For the first time in years, Mr. Arafat's security forces used deadly force against Palestinians to suppress a demonstration in support of Osama bin Laden. In a cloud of tear gas and a hail of bullets, two Palestinians -- one of them only 13 -- were slain. Another was close to death.","925":"Those who think the evidence points toward terrorism note that the contaminated building was close to an airport used for flight training by the terrorists, and that tabloids housed in the building had published cover articles highly critical of Osama bin Laden. But whether the bin Laden network would consider a supermarket tabloid a fit target seems dubious. This is a mystery that has only begun to be unraveled.","926":"CAIRO, Oct. 8\u2014 Osama bin Laden's internationally televised speech on Sunday mesmerized many Muslims with its religious and historical imagery, a powerful combination that only magnified his standing with people who wanted to see him as a heroic spokesman for the weak against the strong.","927":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, write out on the board or make copies of the following news excerpt: \u201cStriking at night from aircraft carriers and distant bases, the United States and Britain launched a powerful barrage of cruise missiles and long-range bombers against Afghanistan today to try to destroy the terrorist raining camps of Osama bin Laden\u2019s Qaeda network and the Taliban government that has protected it.\u201d As students enter class, ask them to respond in their journals to the following questions (written on the board for easier access): \u201cWhat feeling do you get when reading this sentence? What words and phrases evoke this feeling the most? What were the author\u2019s intentions when writing this piece? Did he intend to convey a specific feeling? Why or why not?\u201d 2. As a class, read and discuss the remainder of the article \u201cBush Warns \u2018Taliban Will Pay the Price\u2019,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. How did the U.S. respond to terrorist attacks on the night of October 7, 2001? b. Who ordered the strike on Afghanistan? c. According to President Bush, what were the strikes designed to do? d. According to the article, at what targets did the U.S. military aim? e. How did Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain respond to the strike, and what role did Britain play in supporting the offensive? f. According to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, who is the enemy and who is not? g. According to the article, what threat did Osama bin Laden issue on the first day of the U.S. strike? h. How did the Taliban\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan respond to the U.S. strike? i. How long might the aerial campaign against Afghanistan last, according to the article? j. How did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld define the goals of this initial strike by the U.S.? k. In addition to military strikes, what else did the U.S. drop in Afghanistan? l. According to the article, what security measures did the F.B.I. and other U.S. agencies make in response to the military strike? m. What ultimatum did the United States convey to Indonesia following the strike? n. According to the article, what responses to the strike were made by officials in Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, France, Germany, Canada, and Iraq? Which countries supported the U.S.-led strike, and which ones opposed it? 3. Divide students into small groups of two or three, and assign each group a country. Suggested countries include those mentioned in the article \u2014 Canada, Germany, France, Britain, Russia, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan \u2013 though any country besides the U.S. will work. Allow students to search online news sources from their assigned country for articles about the initial attacks on Afghanistan and Al Qaeda bases. After finding an article, ask students to create a bulleted presentation poster that addresses each of the following: -What is the article\u2019s headline? How does this demonstrate the perspective of the news source? -After reading the article, what can you deduce about the perspective of the journalist? Do you feel guided in one direction or the other? Explain the journalist\u2019s intention. -What sources are listed in the article? -Count the number of quotations and statements that demonstrate support for the U.S. strike and those that convey opposition to the U.S. strike. How balanced is the coverage? In a future class, students should present their summary presentations. Allow other students to question the presenters about the news source\u2019s perspective, and as a class discuss whether or not students feel it\u2019s important to present a balance of perspectives. Suggested Online News Sources: Ecola Newsstand provides English language newspapers and magazines from around the world. Internet Public Library\u2018s collection of Online Newspapers. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Ask each student to write a personal reaction to the articles read in class. How did the article from the non-U.S. news source compare to the New York Times piece? Did both authors have similar intentions? How would you feel if you were a reporter covering this event? What pressures would you feel from your readers to convey an objective response? Or would there be greater pressure from readers to convey a response that was sympathetic only to their nation\u2019s view? Would a reporter from a country not directly affected by the recent terrorist attacks on the U.S. and the responding strike in Afghanistan feel different kinds of pressures? Why or why not?","928":"Pakistan, which shares a long border with Afghanistan and was instrumental in the rise of the Taliban, who control most of that country, is more crucial than India now to the campaign to deal with Osama bin Laden. India offered its unconditional support to the United States from the start, and Pakistan was forced to cooperate under the threat of being treated as a target itself.","929":"Only hours after his police officers battled in the streets of Gaza with Palestinian students who were demonstrating in support of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Arafat's representatives sat down with the leaders of the extremist group Hamas and other Palestinian factions to produce a joint statement: 'We must continue the intifada and the resistance to the Israeli occupation,' it read, in part.","93":"Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producer, is a close ally of the United States and the presence of American troops in the kingdom has been denounced by religious conservatives and by the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has made the expulsion of American troops his main demand.","931":"Indeed, the hazards until now have been minimal for American forces, who were described by officials in Washington as having essentially taken control of the Afghan skies while knocking out some of the larger and more sophisticated training camps of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. One camp near Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, was said by intelligence officials to have been a site for testing chemical and biological weapons.","932":"Mr. Clarke, who has extensive experience in the executive branch, became national counterterrorism coordinator at the Clinton White House. There he was considered abrasive and secretive. But he was nonetheless respected for his ability to get things done, and he has been watching Osama bin Laden for years.","933":"The groom was Said Bahaji, now the focus of an international manhunt for his suspected role in the Sept. 11 attacks. Prominent among the guests was Mamoun Darkazanli, a Syrian businessman suspected of being a financial conduit for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization. Another guest was Mr. Atta's friend, Marwan al-Shehhi, whom authorities say crashed the second hijacked airliner into the World Trade Center.","934":"CAIRO, Oct. 9\u2014 Just how big a threat to moderate Arab and Muslim regimes is Osama bin Laden's militant sword of Islam?","935":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9\u2014 Terrorists tied to Osama bin Laden's network and based in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the likely targets of future covert and overt American actions, United States officials said today.","936":"'I don't know who told the Pakistani president that,' Mr. Bush said. 'Generally, you know, we don't talk about military plans.' He said there was 'one way to shorten the campaign in Afghanistan, and that's for the -- Osama bin Laden and his leadership to be turned over so they can be brought to justice.'","937":"A news analysis article on Tuesday about assessments of the taped speech by Osama bin Laden misstated the government background of one authority, Daniel Benjamin, a former United States official who is writing a book on religious terror. He served in the Clinton administration, not the Bush administration.","938":"The service is given credit for thwarting a major terrorist attack on the eve of the millennium celebration in December 1999, when a customs inspector in Washington State found a trunkload of explosives in the car of an Algerian who later acknowledged having trained at terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden.","939":"'There's one way to shorten the campaign in Afghanistan,' Mr. Bush added, 'and that's for Osama bin Laden and the leadership of Al Qaeda to be turned over and brought to justice.'","94":"The statement did not say what the 'important evidence' referred to by Mr. Saleh was, but Yemeni officials said it did not mean that Yemen had any strong leads, despite its police sweep and what the officials described as 'several dozen' arrests of people being held for questioning. Yemen's official position in the last year has been that Islamic terrorist organizations that the State Department once described as having 'safe haven' in Yemen, including groups linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian-born millionaire who is the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist suspect, have been crushed by crackdowns after previous terrorist incidents. Those included a hotel bombing in 1992 and numerous kidnappings of tourists, diplomats and others.","940":"Iraq is among a handful of countries that have not publicly condemned the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Aldouri told the United Nations General Assembly last week that Iraq had sent messages of condolences to individuals in the United States, but that it would have been hypocritical to condemn the bombings, given the sanctions and bombings against Iraq. Some officials in Washington have urged military action against Iraq as part of the campaign against Osama bin Laden and his terror network, contending that the Baghdad government is another sponsor of terrorism.","941":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9\u2014 The Pentagon is preparing to launch risky raids into Afghanistan using low-flying Army helicopter gunships to find and attack forces allied with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and the Taliban government, two senior Pentagon officials said today.","942":"But even if the political will exists to protect oil supplies, oil companies and producers are worried that terrorists could take aim at the vast web of infrastructure that carries oil around the world. Western oil companies for the last month have been scrutinizing their oil wells, flow stations, pipelines and refineries for vulnerability to attack and sabotage -- especially in countries where substantial numbers are sympathetic to Osama bin Laden's cause.","943":"A man facing trial on charges of taking part in a terror conspiracy with Osama bin Laden is in virtual solitary confinement and almost completely unable to leave his cell after the attack on the World Trade Center, his lawyer told a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday. After the court appearance, the lawyer, John Jacobs, also said he was considering asking the judge for a change of venue because he fears his client cannot receive a fair trial in Manhattan. The defendant, Mohamed Suleiman al Nalfi, a native of Sudan, 'has been in basically a total lockdown' in the Metropolitan Correctional Center since Sept. 11, Mr. Jacobs told the judge. But Mr. Jacobs said prosecutors had indicated that conditions might be relaxed after the sentencing this month of four terrorists convicted in the embassy bombings case. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","944":"The first episode, which was to have had its premiere in recent weeks but was held after the attacks, was shown to journalists in the summer. It portrayed the C.I.A. and the M.I. 6, its counterpart in Britain, as seeking to prevent a bomb attack in London by operatives for Osama bin Laden. 'They didn't think it was all that interesting,' Mr. Beckner said. That reaction, too, is unlikely with the current mood.","945":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 9\u2014 A top aide to Osama bin Laden appeared in a videotaped message tonight and implied that airplane hijackings like those that killed thousands of Americans at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon could be repeated.","946":"Al Jazeera has angered some Americans by replaying, several times, a 1998 interview with Osama bin Laden. It is surely Mr. bin Laden's favored news outlet, the one he chose to disseminate the video made after the Sept. 11 attacks. Al Jazeera is also the only station permitted to have a reporter inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. All these broadcasts are legitimate and valuable, and news organizations worldwide have repeatedly run Al Jazeera's tapes and reported its scoops.","947":"But a Congressional aide said that the president had been particularly outraged by an article in The Washington Post last Friday that asserted that 'intelligence officials have told members of Congress there is a high probability that terrorists associated with Osama bin Laden will try to launch another major attack on American targets here or abroad in the near future.'","948":"I would not describe Osama bin Laden's videotaped message as a 'taunt' from a 'defiant' terrorist (news articles, Oct. 8). It sounded more like a frustrated lament from a bitter and hate-filled man who is unable to live in peace, but unable to win his war.","949":"Administration officials said yesterday that the bombing of Afghanistan by American warplanes had destroyed at least seven of the largest and most sophisticated training camps that Osama bin Laden's network had long operated.","95":"That means that any prosecution that might ultimately result from the Yemen investigation would be brought by the office of Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose prosecutors have vast experience in terrorism cases, most recently in the investigation of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","950":"The demand for restitution came just days before the four are to be sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan for their roles in the terrorism conspiracy. All four were convicted of conspiring in a plot led by Osama bin Laden to bomb two American Embassies in Africa in 1998, which killed 224 people.","951":"Al Jazeera has angered some Americans by replaying, several times, a 1998 interview with Osama bin Laden. It is surely Mr. bin Laden's favored news outlet, the one he chose to disseminate the video made after the Sept. 11 attacks. Al Jazeera is also the only station permitted to have a reporter inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. All these broadcasts are legitimate and valuable, and news organizations worldwide have repeatedly run Al Jazeera's tapes and reported its scoops.","952":"But a Congressional aide said that the president had been particularly outraged by an article in The Washington Post last Friday that asserted that 'intelligence officials have told members of Congress there is a high probability that terrorists associated with Osama bin Laden will try to launch another major attack on American targets here or abroad in the near future.'","953":"'The face and the voice of the enemy,' Peter Jennings said after showing Osama bin Laden's videotaped message following the attacks on Afghanistan Sunday. But as strange as it was to see the enemy with such sudden and chilling intimacy in our living rooms -- that gaunt, incongruous figure in a traditional turban holding a modern microphone -- the bin Laden tape was only the first dramatic marker of how different this televised conflict is from any war coverage we have known.","954":"The organization of Osama bin Laden threatened more terrorist attacks on Americans in a second taped message yesterday, obliging television news executives to consider whether broadcasting such statements served viewers, or Al Qaeda's propaganda goals.","955":"HITTING BIN LADEN -- American bombing has destroyed many of the largest and most sophisticated of Osama bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. A1","956":"There has been only one request for an Osama bin Laden mask, which Mr. Bianchi does not have, although he said he had heard rumors that a factory in Mexico is rushing to make them. Anyway, he said, political figures always sell better for political demonstrations than for Halloween.","957":"So far the administration has struggled to maintain the appropriate balance. Yesterday, for example, the White House requested that broadcast network executives not air in full the prerecorded statements of Osama bin Laden and his aides. The White House expressed concern about giving the terrorists unchecked outlets for their propaganda. It also warned that such appearances might contain coded messages meant for bin Laden operatives around the world. The five major television news organizations agreed jointly to abridge future videotaped statements. The White House suggested that print media might also be asked not to publish the complete texts of Mr. bin Laden's statements.","958":"'Osama bin Laden is not responsible for this county's budget problems,' said Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the County Legislature's minority leader, a Republican. 'The county executive has submitted a flawed budget.'","959":"Mr. Sheikh reappeared as one of a gang who kidnapped three British tourists in India on behalf of a Kashmiri separatist group, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen -- an organization now viewed as one of the myriad Islamic groups possibly linked to Osama bin Laden, America's prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The young Briton was shot and captured in a subsequent Indian police raid, then jailed.","96":"Tonight, American officials here reiterated that they had no firm leads on the Cole's attackers. Partly because of Yemen's history as a refuge for Islamic and leftist radical groups, theories in Aden have covered a broad spectrum of possibilities. The most common one is that the attack may be linked to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, who has been indicted in the United States in connection with the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.","960":"A senior Philippine official said yesterday that the United States planned to send a 'sizable' contingent of military advisers to the Philippines in the next few weeks to help it crackdown on terrorist groups suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden.","961":"AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 10\u2014 The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon brought immediate accusations not only against Osama bin Laden but against Saddam Hussein of Iraq as his likely partner in crime.","962":"The decision to shift authority over potential criminal prosecutions stemming from the Sept. 11 terror attacks from New York to Washington has upset and frustrated law enforcement officials who have investigated Osama bin Laden for nearly a decade.","963":"While Mrs. Zia has been supportive of the American campaign to capture Osama bin Laden, the Jamaat leader, Matiur Rahman Nizami, said in an interview that the United States did not have enough evidence against Mr. bin Laden to justify military attacks and warned that the bombing 'would definitely cause widespread anger and revulsion in the entire Muslim world.'","964":"'Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War,' researched and written by a strong interdisciplinary team of writers for The New York Times, is an impressive account of the evolution of biological weapons over the last 70 years, from the intensely secret, state-run programs in the United States and the Soviet Union to the less disciplined and more dangerous flirtation with lethal agents in recent years by small adversaries of the United States like Iraq and by presumably well-financed terrorists like Osama bin Laden.","965":"The five major television news organizations reached a joint agreement yesterday to follow the suggestion of the White House and abridge any future videotaped statements from Osama bin Laden or his followers to remove language the government considers inflammatory.","966":"Mr. Musharraf's declaration yesterday that 'no extremist activity will be tolerated in any quarter of Pakistan' came in response to serious anti-American protests. On the same day, one radical Pakistani Islamist leader vowed to send 10,000 warriors 'against U.S. and all the infidel forces.' Soldiers were deployed and sandbag bunkers set up here in the capital. A poll showed 62 percent of Pakistanis opposing involvement in the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Even Mr. Musharraf's grip on his own armed forces has been called into question.","967":"American warplanes pounded barracks, garrisons and troop encampments across Afghanistan in what appeared to be the most punishing air strikes yet against the ground forces of the Taliban regime. Troops in the field have been largely spared, with planes concentrating on striking command centers, airfields and the terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden. A1","968":"Photos: Three men suspected of ties to Osama bin Laden were held yesterday. They are, from top, Lased bin Heni, Riyadh Jelassi, and Muhammad bin Belgacem Awadi. (Associated Press); (Reuters)","969":"The statement by an 'authorized security source' came in the form of partial confirmation of a magazine article that blamed Al Qaeda, the terror network run by Osama bin Laden, for the New York and Washington attacks.","97":"Prosecutors say Mr. Salim, who is from Sudan, was a senior deputy to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, and that he tried to obtain materials on Mr. bin Laden's behalf that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Salim was placed on a suicide watch in a Munich jail cell, the German official, Rupert Folger, said.","970":"American officials say they have evidence that Osama bin Laden is using a network of shops that sell honey -- a staple of Middle Eastern life since biblical times -- to generate income and secretly move weapons, drugs and agents throughout Al Qaeda, his terrorist network.","971":"If the statement's language seemed murky, Washington policy makers could still breathe a deep sigh of relief at moving past a first test of their bombing raids. The emergency gathering of the Organization of the Islamic Conference had been called by Iran. Evidence of significant opposition could have shredded American efforts to build an alliance that included Arabs and Muslims against Osama bin Laden and other terrorists.","972":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 10\u2014 President Bush today announced the creation of a most wanted list of international terrorists, a roster of 22 suspects led by Osama bin Laden and several of his lieutenants.","973":"Far from avoiding the Arab press, the United States should appoint a spokesperson to Al Jazeera. Osama bin Laden has been openly appealing for support from the Muslim 'man on the street.' Shouldn't we be doing the same?","974":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 10\u2014 Saudi Arabia has so far refused to freeze the assets of Osama bin Laden and his associates, and has proved unwilling to cooperate fully on the investigation of the hijacking suspects in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Bush administration officials said today.","975":"Osama bin Laden skillfully used television news programs to deliver his defiant message.","976":"In choosing Mr. Kallstrom, Mr. Pataki has reached out to someone with a great deal of knowledge about the Islamic terrorist networks in this region, having been part of the investigation into the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and later plots by other Islamic fundamentalist terrorists with links to Osama bin Laden.","977":"Photo: Posters of 22 fugitives, including Osama bin Laden, lined a wall yesterday at F.B.I. headquarters, where President Bush announced a list of leading terrorism suspects. Page B3. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)","978":"In Gaza, Abu Osama Awad tried to untangle the contradictions exposed by the bombing. 'If we support bin Laden, it means that the Palestinians are going to lose,' said Mr. Awad, 36, owner of a juice factory, referring to Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11. 'Because we will lose the support of Europe and America.","979":"Pakistani intelligence officials said tonight that there was no evidence that any senior member of the Taliban or Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, had been killed in the initial attacks.","98":"Officials said they received reports in May that a group linked to Osama bin Laden was preparing an attack on American targets. PAGE A14","980":"Having already claimed to basically own the Afghan skies, the Americans looked to 'condition the environment' -- Pentagon-speak for weakening both the Taliban and Arab fighters enlisted by Osama bin Laden, so American and British special forces may eventually be able to operate with some safety inside Afghanistan.","981":"During the last four weeks, the authorities in eight European countries have fanned out through the slums of London, Madrid, Milan and other cities to smoke out and smash what they say are militant cells with links to Osama bin Laden.","982":"DENVER, Oct. 11\u2014 Beside the T-shirts emblazoned with American flags, the Statue of Liberty and other patriotic symbols, a souvenir shop here is selling one that bears the face of Osama bin Laden in a Wild West poster format that says, 'Wanted, Dead.'","983":"We are proof that society does not require all its citizens to share the same religious belief, as Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda assert.","984":"Using a mixture of straight talk, statesmanship and a touch of humor here and there, Mr. Bush clarified and sharpened his positions on several important issues. It was heartening to hear him say the United States and its allies will not walk away from Afghanistan once Osama bin Laden and his followers are captured or killed. His inclination to seek the assistance of the United Nations in establishing a new government in Kabul if the Taliban is ousted was wise. And his reaffirmation of the need for humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan -- including donations from American children -- seemed heartfelt. Mr. Bush may have scrambled his stern message slightly when he offered to reconsider the military assault on Afghanistan if the Taliban leadership surrenders Mr. bin Laden, but the gesture is likely to reassure other Muslim nations that Washington is not bloody-minded.","985":"His aides have said that Mr. Bush does not intend to keep the military in Afghanistan if the Taliban and its allies in Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network are defeated. But as Andrew Johnson discovered after the Civil War, as Harry Truman discovered after dropping the atom bomb, and as Bill Clinton discovered in Bosnia and Kosovo, the peace is not won when the fighting ends, it is won by rebuilding so that a defeated country does not implode again.","986":"The Bush administration asked newspapers not to publish full transcripts of statements by Osama bin Laden. B7","987":"MATTHEW F. BOGDANOS, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the rap mogul SEAN COMBS on weapons and bribery charges, would have joined the hunt for Osama bin Laden by now. Mr. Bogdanos, 44, is a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve. But the Marines delayed the date on which he was to report for duty until after his family returned to their apartment in Lower Manhattan.","988":"Vladimir Putin would also like to seize the opportunity to improve his standing with the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Many expected him to demand Western approval for Russia's antiterrorist war in Chechnya, and a slowdown of NATO's plans to expand to include the Baltic states, as the price for his support for the war against Osama bin Laden and his kind. Instead, he has used that support as a launch pad for a strategic campaign to have Russia accepted as a full member of the West, and of Europe. The NATO secretary-general, Lord George Robertson, confirms that at his Oct. 2 meeting with Mr. Putin the Russian president made it plain that while he still did not like the idea of the Baltic states joining NATO, he was not going to invest political capital in attempting to stop it.","989":"DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 10\u2014 Walter Mourad wants vengeance against Osama bin Laden for messing with an American dream built on a firm foundation of dry cleaning.","99":"The group said to be preparing the attack was the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a faction of which is closely associated with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier who tops the United States list of most-wanted terrorists. The Jihad and Mr. bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, or 'the base,' have come under scrutiny by American and Yemeni officials as possible culprits in the bombing last Thursday of the American destroyer Cole in Aden, Yemen, an attack that killed 17 sailors.","990":"President Bush and other senior administration officials have indicated that they would like to topple the Taliban government quickly so as to lower military resistance to operations by special forces aimed at capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and eliminating his terrorist network.","991":"As a follower of the Prince of Peace, I am deeply pained, as I know so many others are, that the failure of diplomatic initiatives has resulted in the recent military strikes that our government and its allies have launched against the terrorist forces of Osama bin Laden and his supporters among the Taliban in Afghanistan (front page, Oct. 10).","992":"The White House has asked U.S. networks to limit broadcasts of statements by Osama bin Laden. I wish that instead of censorship, the president would respond to him. Here's what Mr. Bush could say:","993":"Western experts say that small numbers of Chinese Uighurs have trained or fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan and that arms have sometimes been smuggled from Central Asia into Xinjiang. However, there is no evidence that the Taliban or Osama bin Laden have seriously targeted China for subversion.","994":"Q. You said that the threat is ongoing and indeed the deadly virus of anthrax was found in three Florida people this week. Osama bin Laden's spokesman said storms of planes are yet to be hijacked. The -- your F.B.I. warned just today that terrorist attacks could be happening again in the next couple days. If the F.B.I. knows of a credible threat, can you assure the public that you would take the precaution of locking down any system involved, whether it's buildings, airports, water systems, to prevent more deaths? And most importantly, is there anything you can say to Americans who feel helpless to protect themselves and their families from the next wave of attacks, if there are more to come? What can people do to protect themselves?","995":"Rogge, who was a member of Belgium's rowing team at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, where 11 members of Israel's team were killed by Palestinian terrorists, said he had never heard of a credible threat against the Olympics by Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of organizing the Sept. 11 attacks.","996":"In an echo of 1990, Osama bin Laden tried, in his videotaped message this week, to make the same linkage, tying his actions to the cause of Palestine, declaring, 'America will not live in peace before peace reigns in Palestine.' Much like Saddam Hussein, he is trying to gain legitimacy by implying that his attack on America was about the plight of the Palestinians.","997":"The Bush administration asked newspapers yesterday to refrain from publishing full transcripts of statements issued by Osama bin Laden or his followers, asserting that such statements could inflame Mr. bin Laden's followers and may contain coded messages that could incite attacks on American targets.","998":"As a citizen, I was disturbed by President Bush's comments regarding the leak of information as well as by his request that the TV networks abridge statements by Osama bin Laden and his aides. One clear distinction between us and these extremists is our freedom of the press. Jeopardizing this basic constitutional right, which forms the bedrock of a democratic society, would amount to nothing more than endorsing a tactic used by repressive regimes around the world.","999":"The option of pursuing other terrorists groups in other Arab countries is still to be explored. But American officials said they are concerned that allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia do not yet fully grasp that Mr. Bush's 'new war' against terrorism may not end with the elimination of Osama bin Laden and could involve chasing terrorist groups in other countries."}
