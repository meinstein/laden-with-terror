Those strikes were aimed at Osama bin Laden -- whom Washington accuses of being the mastermind of the attacks -- even though the bin Laden-inspired terrorist apparatus is a stateless organization of anti-American Islamic militants.","196":"The history of Courtroom 318 as the site of terrorism trials continues tomorrow. Four men go on trial, charged with conspiring in the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998 and in other acts of terrorism, the government says, that were orchestrated by one man, the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","197":"The trial of four men charged with conspiring in the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998 and in other acts of terrorism that the government says were orchestrated by one man, the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, opens in Federal District Court in Manhattan tomorrow. 27","198":"A court transcript suggests that the first witness in the embassy bombing trial will be a man who once worked for Osama bin Laden. PAGE B1","199":"The trial in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa is to begin today in Federal District Court in Manhattan amid signs that the government's first witness will be an informer who once worked for Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. B1","2":"Pakistan, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are the only countries that recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban government, which, as the host to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born exile accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, is not usually blessed as a peacemaker.","20":"Separately, Mr. Tenet provided the Senate panel with a broad review of global threats facing the United States, including terrorism. He said that United States intelligence officials believe that Osama bin Laden, charged in the 1998 bombing of two American embassies in Africa, had developed new tactics to try to strike American interests with his terrorist network. Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is now living in Afghanistan. Mr. Tenet said the United States believed that Mr. bin Laden's terrorist organization, along with other terrorist groups, were now 'placing increased emphasis on developing surrogates to carry out attacks in an effort to avoid detection.'","200":"The trial in the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa is to begin this morning in Federal District Court in Manhattan and indications are that the government's first witness will be an informer who worked for the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden until 1996, when he agreed to cooperate with the American authorities.","202":"The need for extra vigilance should not be underestimated, given the brutal nature of the crimes and the breadth of the conspiracy outlined by the government. Two of the defendants are charged with directly assisting in the embassy bombings, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 4,000. The other two are accused more broadly of involvement in a global conspiracy spanning Asia and Africa that prosecutors say is directed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile now believed to be living in Afghanistan. In their opening statement to the jury yesterday, prosecutors linked the conspiracy to the 1993 ambush of American troops in Somalia in which 18 soldiers died.","203":"In its opening statement, the government suggested that the bombings had been masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban, which rules the country, and carried out by members of his group, Al Qaeda.","204":"A secret government witness, Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, emerged to tell a hushed federal courtroom in Manhattan how he helped the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden move money and arms to terrorist groups in Africa and the Middle East as part of a conspiracy aimed at the United States. He testified in the trial of four men accused in the embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A1","205":"A secret government witness emerged yesterday to tell a hushed federal courtroom in Manhattan how he helped the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden move money and arms to terrorist groups in Africa and the Middle East as part of a conspiracy aimed at the United States.","206":"The United States, which under the Clinton administration led a campaign in the United Nations to impose sanctions on the Taliban for their refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy, said today that it would fly relief goods to the battered country.","208":"Yesterday, the man, Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, recounted the conversation in Federal District Court in Manhattan, telling a jury what had driven him into the hands of the Americans, a decision that involved an even more difficult step: betraying his leader, Osama bin Laden.","209":"On other topics, Mr. Tenet reaffirmed the Central Intelligence Agency's belief that the nature and structure of anti-American terrorism had radically changed over the last few years and was now dominated by independent and decentralized groups like that of Osama bin Laden. The United States has said Mr. bin Laden and his group, al-Qaeda, were behind the bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998, as well as other anti-American terrorist attacks.","210":"The trial of four men in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa began in New York with prosecutors calling as their first witness a Sudanese man who served as a close aide to Osama bin Laden and described the inner workings of his group, Al Qaeda. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been indicted in the case, is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, but his presence is likely to be felt constantly during the trial, as prosecutors build a case that he led a broad terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans, which included the embassy attacks. Benjamin Weiser","211":"The militant Islamic government, which controls most of the country, has been under Security Council sanctions for not turning over to the United States Osama bin Laden, who is believed to finance terrorism, and has been criticized widely for its human rights record.","212":"Prosecutors called a shadowy figure to the stand who was once a close aide to Osama bin Laden, the man the government believes was the mastermind behind the bombings. The witness, a convicted terrorist named Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, gave the jury an insider's look at Mr. bin Laden's world, recounting his support for other jihad groups, his justification for attacks against the United States and his attempt to buy uranium, possibly to make a nuclear weapon.","214":"But on Friday, the administration announced that it would close down the Taliban office in New York, the only presence the movement has in the United States. Denied Afghanistan's United Nations seat, the Taliban have used a small office in Queens to stay in touch with United Nations officials and with Washington, which is demanding that Afghanistan turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy.","215":"While terrorists may be known for exporting chaos and mayhem, the international group that prosecutors say is run by Osama bin Laden emerged last week in the first two days of testimony at the trial in the American Embassy bombings in East Africa as a sleek and highly organized outfit in fairly good corporate trim.","216":"Jamal Ahmed Al-Fadl, a government witness who was once a close aide to Osama bin Laden, testified in the embassy bombings trial that he had proudly worked for Mr. bin Laden against the United States, but later acknowledged telling American agents that Mr. bin Laden 'misinterprets certain portions of the Koran to justify violent action.' B1","217":"Though Mr. Bush never used the phrase today, the movement he endorsed is known within the military establishment as the 'revolution in military affairs.' It takes many forms, but focuses on the development of new weapons, often designed to attack not only enemy states, but small groups of terrorists who, like Osama bin Laden, can pose a major threat to the United States and its allies.","218":"A former close aide to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden testified yesterday under cross-examination in the embassy bombings trial that he worked proudly for Mr. bin Laden in his war against the United States, but later acknowledged telling American agents that Mr. bin Laden 'misinterprets certain portions of the Koran to justify violent action.'","219":"An Egyptian-born flight instructor who worked freelance as Osama bin Laden's pilot said yesterday that he once helped the bin Laden organization buy a $200,000 decommissioned military jet in order to ship Stinger antiaircraft missiles from Pakistan to Sudan.","22":"Ariana, Afghanistan's state-run airline, is under international sanctions and is not permitted to fly international routes. The United Nations imposed sanctions against the airline in November to punish the ruling Taliban movement for its refusal to extradite the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, who reportedly has been living in Afghanistan for the last few years.","221":"For now, Mr. Hussein may not even be America's most dangerous foe. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born extremist who is the FBI's most wanted terrorist suspect, has in recent years struck with more deadly effect at American interests, orchestrating the August 1998 bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa, and is suspected of being behind the bombing last October of the destroyer Cole in Yemen.","222":"Mr. Saleh also reiterated in an interview with the Saudi-owned Middle East Broadcasting Corporation that there still is no evidence linking the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden to the Oct. 12 suicide bombing in the harbor of Aden, Yemen, that killed 17 American sailors.","226":"More than a dozen Islamic militants have been arrested in Germany and Britain, and American officials say some were plotting terror attacks in Europe and elsewhere. The arrests are part of a crackdown on a network with ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi radical accused of plotting the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998. A1","227":"A former close aide to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden testified yesterday that he offered officials of the Saudi government a plan to assassinate Mr. bin Laden, and later discussed his proposal with American officials.","228":"Spurred by growing international alarm about Osama bin Laden's militant networks, the police in Britain and Germany have recently arrested more than a dozen Islamic radicals. American officials say some of those arrested were plotting terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere.","229":"Yesterday, the host, a man named L'Houssaine Kherchtou, related the story of his visitors at the trial of four men accused of joining a terrorist conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden that resulted in the deadly bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","23":"For more than four years, prosecutors argued, Mr. Fitzgerald and another prosecutor, Kenneth M. Karas, had investigated the activities of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities suspect was the mastermind behind the embassy attacks and other terrorism against Americans. Mr. Fitzgerald's vast experience placed him 'in a unique position to prosecute this extraordinarily complex case,' the government added, and that was why his presence had been so critical in the Odeh interrogation.","230":"Several years ago, the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden told his followers in Sudan that he had money problems, and was cutting back on salaries and travel budgets. But Mr. bin Laden was known as a man of great wealth, and one member of his group, L'Houssaine Kherchtou, asked one of his aides for $500 to cover the cost of a Caesarean section for his wife. He was refused.","231":"Although four of the defendants named in the government's enormous indictment -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- are in custody and appear in court each day, the testimony and exhibits presented so far have focused on a man who is nowhere to be found: Osama bin Laden.","233":"On a typical weekend, the witness said, Osama bin Laden liked to relax at his farm near the Blue Nile in Sudan, where he spent time riding horses. His followers would often accompany him, the witness went on, and they would picnic on the grounds of the farm or swim or amuse themselves by playing soccer.","234":"After his recovery, Mr. Odeh spent nearly three months immersed in the study of Islamic law. It was then, Agent Anticep said, that he was approached by Al Qaeda, the group run by Osama bin Laden, whom prosecutors have accused of masterminding the embassy attacks.","235":"The statement also revealed for the first time that on the eve of the bombing, 'people' in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the attack, was based, had already hunkered down in anticipation of an American military strike. In Kandahar, Afghanistan, Mr. Odeh's statement says, these people, who were never identified, believed there was a 'possibility of the U.S. Navy sending in warplanes or missiles to retaliate.'","236":"BRITAIN: TERROR CRACKDOWN -- The government named 21 groups that can no longer be active or raise money in Britain, under a new law aimed at ending international complaints that Britain is a haven for groups plotting violence abroad. Among those on the terror list were: the Greek November 17 organization; the Basque separatist E.T.A.; Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers; Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden; Hezbollah; the People's Mujahedeen of Iran; and Algerian, Egyptian, Palestinian, Kashmiri and Turkish groups. Warren Hoge (NYT)","237":"Afghans have been at war for 22 years, first in an epic resistance against Soviet troops, then in factional, back-stabbing combat against each other. Most of the nation is now ruled by Taliban mullahs who offend the West with their stern interpretations of Islam and their unflagging hospitality to the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.","238":"The four men have been accused of joining with Osama bin Laden in a terrorist plot that led to the Nairobi blast, which killed more than 200 people. It was nearly simultaneous with the bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania, which killed 11 more.","239":"An audio and visual specialist, Mr. Blum is called in to make sure all gadgetry is running smoothly, particularly now that there is a complex case like the current one, where four men are accused of conspiring in the bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa. Security is huge, with the specter of Osama bin Laden, the distant Saudi exile and accused mastermind, looming in the air.","24":"Unfortunately, this same wired world also super-empowers angry people. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire allegedly responsible for blowing up two U.S. embassies in East Africa, is a super-empowered angry man. He had his own network, a sort of Jihad Online (JOL), which he used to take on the U.S. and kill Americans. And do you know what we did to him? We fired 75 cruise missiles at him. We fired 75 cruise missiles at a person! That was a superpower versus a super-empowered angry man.","240":"He said the decision to destroy Afghanistan's pre-Islamic heritage may have been a response to the isolation felt by the Taliban since United Nations sanctions were imposed on the nation in January for failing to surrender Saudi militant Osama bin Laden.","241":"The campaign against the statues was ordered by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, who declared that they had been worshiped as false gods in the past and, if left standing, might be so venerated again. Previous Taliban decrees have banned women from getting an education or holding jobs, condemning millions of Afghans to poverty and powerlessness. The Taliban also shelter Osama bin Laden, whose terrorist network murders innocent people around the world in a twisted version of Islamic holy war.","242":"The trial, which will enter its fifth week in Federal District Court tomorrow, concerns the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998. Four men, Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, have been charged with joining forces with Osama bin Laden in a global terrorist conspiracy that eventually led to the attacks, which killed more than 200 people.","243":"The Taliban crave recognition. But instead of acknowledgment from the United Nations, the Taliban have received sanctions, in part as punishment for hospitality given to the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.","244":"The anti-idol declaration by Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's chieftain, ought to be seen for what it is above all else: a crystal-clear signal that Osama bin Laden, the Saudi terrorist who has lived in Afghanistan since 1996, has found a true spiritual brother in the Taliban movement. The Taliban's six-year war of conquest -- to which Mr. bin Laden contributes a small but not insignificant Arab force -- has developed into a brutal fight where no quarter is given to Afghans who oppose Mullah Omar's prophet-like pretensions.","245":"The four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been accused of joining with Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the bombing of the Nairobi embassy and a nearly simultaneous blast that destroyed the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 11 more.","246":"The bombings trial concerns the terrorist attacks on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people. Four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been charged in the case, accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a global conspiracy that led to the blasts.","247":"Mr. Meskini's guilty plea on Wednesday, which was reported yesterday in The Washington Post, occurred before Judge Loretta A. Preska in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the same place where four men are now on trial, facing charges that they joined with Osama bin Laden in a global conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","248":"The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, may be able to tell the Taliban directly of his concern about the fate of the two large Buddha statues at Bamiyan, which Islamic zealots in Afghanistan say they intend to destroy. Mystery hangs over the statues' fate: the Taliban have not allowed outsiders to travel to the town, a two-day drive to the west of Kabul. Mr. Annan may meet Taliban officials in Pakistan, the first stop on a 10-day trip, where he may also discuss the future of the fugitive sponsor of terrorism, Osama bin Laden. Barbara Crossette","249":"Relations between the United Nations and the Taliban have never been good, and they have worsened with fresh sanctions imposed in January to press for the extradition of Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of organizing terror attacks against American targets and has been given asylum by the Taliban.","25":"AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 16\u2014 A military prosecutor has indicted 13 suspects on charges of terrorism linked to the activities of Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist mastermind, government officials said today.","250":"Mr. Ressam, who prosecutors suspect is connected to the terrorist network believed to be headed by Osama bin Laden, is accused of entering Washington State aboard a ferry from Canada with a car loaded with bomb-making materials.","251":"But from the opening arguments in court here, it was unclear just how far the prosecutors would go to prove that the defendant, Ahmed Ressam, 33, planned to blow up West Coast airports and downtown areas, as they have charged, at the behest of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi suspected of orchestrating a series of international terrorist acts.","252":"The bombings trial, now being heard in Federal District Court in Manhattan, concerns both of these bloody attacks, which occurred miles apart but nearly simultaneously, resulting in 224 deaths. Four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been charged in the case, accused of joining with Osama bin Laden in an international terrorist conspiracy that eventually led to the assaults. Mr. Mohamed was charged with riding in the truck that took the bomb to the embassy in Dar es Salaam. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.","253":"Asked about Mary Jo White, the federal prosecutor in New York, Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ashcroft, said Ms. White would remain on the job indefinitely. The reason, Ms. Tucker said, is 'primarily because of Ms. White's involvement' in the case of Osama bin Laden, suspected of orchestrating terrorist acts, and not because of her office's investigation into the pardons issued by Mr. Clinton.","254":"Mr. Mohamed has been charged with playing a direct role in the carnage and chaos that was depicted on the screen just inches from his face. He has been accused of riding in the truck that carried the bomb and of joining three other men in a terrorist plot with Osama bin Laden that resulted in the bombings of the United States Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998.","255":"MR. STARR believes the United States should use this moment to rethink its policies in all of Central and South Asia. Afghanistan's collapse is poisoning a wide region through the export of terrorism, the closing of trade routes and narcotics, he said, and American policy reinforces the Taliban's isolation. They now cannot hold a United Nations seat and are, unlike their enemies, under an arms embargo. When they slashed opium cultivation last year, there were no rewards, only more isolation, because they would not turn over Osama bin Laden.","256":"Mr. Rahmatullah is in the United States on a mission to improve ties and ease the Taliban's isolation. A main focus of his visit, he said, will be to find a way out of the impasse surrounding Osama bin Laden, the terrorist suspect whose presence in Afghanistan has prompted international sanctions.","257":"For instance, Agent Perkins testified that Mr. Mohamed was not a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, the international organization run by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who has been charged with masterminding the attack. Mr. Mohamed and his co-defendants -- Wadih El-Hage, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been accused of joining with Mr. bin Laden in a global conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998.","258":"The arrest of Mr. al Nalfi is apparently a breakthrough for the government in its efforts to round up what it says are terrorists led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Mr. al Nalfi's arrest in November came before the beginning of the embassy bombings trial now under way in Federal District Court in Manhattan.","26":"American officials said Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged with masterminding the 1998 bombings of American Embassies in East Africa, relied on at least nine of the groups in his recent operations.","260":"The agents interviewed Mr. El-Hage about the bombings and what he knew of Osama bin Laden's role in the attacks. Many of the same questions had been put to him just a year before when he testified in front of a federal grand jury that was hearing evidence against Mr. bin Laden in New York.","261":"Mr. Salim, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, has been described by prosecutors as a high-level adviser to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. Mr. Salim was to have been tried with four other men in the current embassy bombings trial in Manhattan, but his case was separated from the others after he was accused of stabbing and critically injuring the guard, Luis Pepe, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Nov. 1.","262":"The government contends that letters like this prove that Mr. El-Hage and his co-defendants -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- used the cloak of legitimate business to disguise their terrorist plot with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. While Mr. Mohamed and Mr. al-'Owhali have confessed to taking part in the bombings, Mr. El-Hage has maintained that he is simply a businessman who worked for Mr. bin Laden and had nothing to do with the deadly attacks.","265":"It was recently introduced at the trial of four men accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Written in Arabic, it covers topics that include advice for Islamic warriors on how to lie low in Western cultures (shave beard, don't be chatty) and explicit guidelines on committing assassinations, using everything from car bombs to clubs to a lethal stew of spoiled meat, green beans and corn.","266":"The prosecution rested its case in the federal trial of four men accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the American embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A 180-page manual introduced at trial constitutes a primer for terrorists, part philosophical treatise, part training guide, part Spy vs. Spy from a back issue of Mad magazine. B1","267":"The manual, 18 chapters in all, was recently introduced at the trial of four men accused of joining Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The document was seized in England last May at the home of a suspect still being sought in the terrorism case.","268":"ROME, April 5\u2014 Italian officials announced today that they had arrested five North African men suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden, and said they were searching for five others. The German police also said they had arrested a member of an Islamic fundamentalist cell today after raiding eight sites in Hesse and Bavaria.","269":"The verdict, coming after less than 11 hours of deliberation over two days, culminated a trial that had been expected to focus on federal charges that Mr. Ressam had plotted to set off bombs at the behest of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi who American authorities say has orchestrated a series of international terrorist acts.","270":"The document, 'Military Studies in the Jihad Against the Tyrants,' surfaced recently at the trial of four men accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden to destroy the embassies. The how-to manual is about 180 pages long and is divided into 18 'lessons' covering a wide range of topics, from forgery and surveillance to advice on how to beat hostages to detailed instructions for various assassination techniques.","271":"Pakistan, which Washington considers an ally, has serious economic and political problems and faces a rising tide of more than a million Afghan refugees. But Washington has also led the drive to isolate the Taliban for harboring Osama bin Laden, who is wanted for masterminding the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.","272":"In that case, he is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in a global conspiracy to kill Americans abroad that included the Aug. 7, 1998, attacks on the American Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 224 people and wounded thousands more.","274":"CNN wrote that after federal prosecutors played the jury a videotape in February of a CNN interview with Osama bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the embassy attacks, 'CNN learned of potential threats to the safety of its correspondents in the Middle East and was forced to cancel the visit of a senior CNN news executive for safety reasons.'","275":"The embassy bombings trial, in which four men -- Wadih El-Hage, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali -- have been charged with joining Osama bin Laden in an international terrorist conspiracy that led to attacks killing more than 200 people, is much like the World Trade Center case, Mr. Precht said. Both, he said, highlight 'a clash of systems.'","276":"His client, Wadih El-Hage, is one of four men accused of participating in a terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the killings of 18 American soldiers in Somalia in the fall of 1993.","277":"Three American officials, including two from the State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, are in Afghanistan to look into the crisis brought on by war, drought and extreme poverty, United Nations officials said. Though the United States and the United Nations have imposed sanctions on Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden, suspected of terrorist activities, the United States is one of the country's biggest aid donors. Celia Dugger (NYT)","278":"In court yesterday, lawyers for one of the defendants, Wadih El-Hage, continued their effort to disprove the government's allegations that their client was a member of a terrorist conspiracy that was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.","279":"On one level, the defense lawyers are concerned that evidence against one man could taint the other. But on a much more fundamental level, they fear that their clients will be seen less as individuals and more collectively, as faceless members of a terrorist conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","28":"The military government has not given ground on the major American concerns: a timetable for the return of democracy, a crackdown on terrorists operating in Pakistan and help in persuading Pakistan's allies who control much of Afghanistan, the Taliban, to turn over Osama bin Laden, the terrorism suspect who is believed to be living there.","280":"The prosecution was allowed to reopen its case yesterday specifically to offer evidence that the killings of 18 American soldiers in Somalia in October 1993 were linked to a global terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","281":"The United Nations Drug Control Program had met resistance from the Clinton administration to any projects to assist Afghans in a drug-eradication program. American policy had been to isolate the Taliban and punish them through United Nations sanctions because of their refusal to turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant wanted in connection with bombings of two American Embassies in Africa. The United States may now have a less rigid policy.","282":"The testimony appeared to condemn what prosecutors say was a global anti-American conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden that included the 1998 African embassy bombings.","283":"Prosecutors have contended that the attack in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, was part of a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans that was led by Osama bin Laden and that also included the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998, which killed 224 people.","284":"Back in February, a prosecutor was questioning a government witness who had once worked for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged with leading a terrorism conspiracy against Americans that prosecutors say included the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa.","285":"Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are expected to begin closing arguments today in the trial of four men charged with joining a terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, which prosecutors say included the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa.","286":"Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Research your country\u2019s official policy on terrorism.

There are sketchy but widely circulated stories that the militants are trained by the Taliban and receive money from drug traffickers and from Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of leading an international terrorist group.","289":"The defendant, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, has been portrayed by his lawyers as an Islamic soldier who was dedicated to the cause of Osama bin Laden but would not have participated in an operation that killed innocent people because it would have violated the tenets of Islam.","29":"Their tasks are made harder by the world's scorn. The Taliban are notorious for imposing a puritanical Islam that includes the head-to-toe sheathing of women and justice by amputation. Only three nations recognize them as Afghanistan's legitimate government. In November, the United Nations -- at Washington's urging -- imposed economic sanctions against the Taliban for their refusal to hand over their guest, the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.","290":"A defense lawyer in the embassy bombings trial charged yesterday that a crucial government witness who was a former aide to Osama bin Laden had lied repeatedly, to the American authorities to win protection for himself, and again when he took the witness stand.","291":"Last fall, Ali A. Mohamed, a former sergeant in the United States Army, pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. At that time, he told the judge that Osama bin Laden had looked at a photograph of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and 'pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber.'","292":"Television needs pictures, but security has made art hard to come by at the federal trial in Manhattan of four men charged with joining a conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden to bomb two United States Embassies in Africa.","293":"Lawyers for two defendants in the embassy bombings trial sharply distanced their clients yesterday from the views of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, saying they had never agreed with his calls for killing Americans around the world.","294":"Mr. Cohn and Mr. Ruhnke each emphasized their clients' youth -- at the time of the bombings, Mr. al-'Owhali was 21 and Mr. Mohamed was 25. Both lawyers also disputed that their clients had knowingly joined any global conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden to kill Americans.","295":"In his rebuttal, Mr. Fitzgerald attacked the defense's position that one of the defendants, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, had never joined a terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans led by Osama bin Laden.","296":"A federal jury in Manhattan began deliberations yesterday in the trial of four men who, federal prosecutors said, conspired in the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people. The jury asked to review 19 pieces of evidence, including maps, grand jury testimony and a declaration by Osama bin Laden, who is said to have led the conspiracy. If convicted, two of the defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, above, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, could face the death penalty. Wadih El-Hage, 40, and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 27, could face life sentences.","297":"A federal judge in the embassy bombings trial ordered the government yesterday to turn over to the defense records of any secret deals that it has made with certain informants who have agreed to cooperate in the investigation of Osama bin Laden. The order covers people who were members of what the government calls Mr. bin Laden's terrorist conspiracy.","298":"In the time it took to pack a bag, I was on my way to the airport. Ten weeks later, I was still in Yemen, reporting on the aftermath of the Islamic terrorist bombing that killed 17 sailors and did $240 million in damage to the ship. As I write this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still hunting the culprits, believed to have been inspired or directed by Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist.","299":"In the embassy bombings trial, prosecutors have turned over thousands of pages of documents from their investigation of the attacks, and of a broader terrorism conspiracy that the government says was led by a Saudi exile, Osama bin Laden.","3":"In Jordan, 13 people were arrested last month in connection with a suspected plot by Islamic radicals linked to a Saudi-born militant, Osama bin Laden, to attack celebrations in Jerusalem and at the Vatican.","30":"Middle Eastern and American officials say they believe that a terrorist plot aimed at Western and Israeli tourists in Jordan in December was coordinated by a key lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile. A1","301":"The judge's ruling came as the jury completed its fifth full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict in the trial. Four defendants are charged in a terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and included the embassy attacks.","302":"The judge said he would consider the request. The jury sent Judge Sand two additional notes -- of a more serious nature -- asking to review exhibits and for the judge to clarify one of his instructions. It was the sixth full day the jury has been weighing the fate of four men charged with joining a terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden and included the 1998 embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania.","303":"Afghanistan is now under United Nations sanctions, imposed at the insistence of the United States because the Islamic movement will not turn over Osama bin Laden for trial in connection with attacks on two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.","304":"The issue arose as the jury in the bombings trial was sent home after a half day of deliberations after one juror complained of severe dental pain and was unable to continue. The jurors are now in their second week of deliberations, in which Mr. Al-'Owhali, Mr. Mohamed and two other defendants are charged in a broad terrorism conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and included the embassy bombings on Aug. 7, 1998.","305":"Prosecutors in both countries believe Mr. Ressam has information on targets and on a terrorist organization led by Osama bin Laden.","307":"Several said they did not believe it was much of a trial without the man reputed to be the mastermind, Osama bin Laden, in the dock. Others in this increasingly poor country said that Kenyans needed money for their wounds, and that justice in a foreign land was a distant second in their interests.","308":"The other two defendants, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 40, were convicted of participating in the conspiracy, which prosecutors said was directed by Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi financier, who has eluded American capture. They face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.","31":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 28\u2014 Middle Eastern and American officials say they believe that a key lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, coordinated a terrorist plot that was aimed at Western and Israeli tourists in Jordan in December.","310":"Four men were convicted yesterday of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in a terrorist plot to bomb the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The blasts killed 224 people, injured thousands and glaringly exposed the United States' vulnerability abroad.","311":"A federal jury convicted four men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in a terror plot that resulted in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, claiming 224 lives. Two defendants found guilty of murder, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, could receive the death penalty. Mr. bin Laden is a fugitive. A1","312":"Before the embassy bombings trial, Osama bin Laden loomed large in the American psyche, a villain of unimaginable evil and sophisticated reach. It was an image fed by destruction done and by American law enforcement eager to drive home the reality of his threat. In some ways, though, it was an image created because so little was known about how he worked.","314":"Like many people wounded in the blast, Mr. Abiuda, 49, said the verdicts in New York on Tuesday against four of Osama bin Laden's followers were important but incomplete. First on his list was the arrest of Mr. bin Laden, the Islamic militant who prosecutors said led a global terrorism conspiracy that included the nearly simultaneous bombings of the American Embassies here and in Tanzania that killed 224 people.","315":"The prosecutor's call for the death penalty came on the first day of a sentencing hearing for Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, one of four men convicted on Tuesday of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a terrorism plot against Americans, which included the embassy attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998.","318":"Four men were convicted in New York on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 and wounded thousands. Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, could face the death penalty; Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 40, face life terms. The trial, which began in February, offered a new vision of Mr. bin Laden's group, no less menacing than the old, but more loose-knit, at times torn by dissension and betrayal. Some members defected over salary disputes. Benjamin Weiser","319":"Osama bin Laden, the most despised of modern terrorists, is being safely sheltered by the Taliban. From this safe haven he is training terrorists from around the world to destroy those governments that do not run their administrations as prescribed by the Taliban's interpretation of Islam.","32":"Mr. Clinton should also press General Musharraf to sever ties with Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, a Kashmiri terrorist group backed by the Pakistani Army. He ought to insist that Pakistan use its close links with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to press for the expulsion of Osama bin Laden, the international terrorist implicated in the deadly bombings of two American embassies in Africa. Another goal should be to persuade Pakistan, as well as India, to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.","320":"Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted of 213 counts of murder in the Nairobi attack and of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans anywhere in the world.","321":"Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted last week of 213 counts of murder in the Nairobi attack. Trial testimony showed that he was supposed to have died in the operation, but changed his mind and ran away after helping to deliver the bomb to the embassy. Mr. al-'Owhali was also convicted of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans.","323":"'It is not the version of the Islam that Osama bin Laden was espousing,' Mr. Fitzgerald said.","325":"Mr. al-'Owhali was convicted last month by the same jury in the Nairobi attack, and of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a terrorist conspiracy to kill Americans anywhere in the world.","327":"A Sudanese man, Abdil Rauf Hawas, suspected of working for the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden was arrested along with an Indian accomplice, Shamim Sarvar, for allegedly planning to blow up the American Embassy in India, domestic news agencies reported. (AP)","329":"The suspected plot was the latest turn in an investigation that was characterized by early breakthroughs but has since failed to provide American and Yemeni officials with the hard evidence they need to win convictions. They have not yet established who was ultimately responsible for the attack, officials said, though Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist, was identified as a prime suspect from the start.","33":"In contrast, the Colombian United Self-Defense, as Mr. Castano's private 5,500-member army is called, has been described as a band of murderous thugs in human rights reports published in the last month by the State Department, the United Nations and the private monitoring group Human Rights Watch. As a result, the State Department is seeking to have Mr. Castano's group added to its list of terrorist organizations along with the likes of Osama bin Laden, who is accused of blowing up American embassies.","330":"That blast and a nearly simultaneous bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, were part of a global conspiracy to kill Americans that prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan. Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, will be sentenced on Sept. 12 to life in prison without parole for the 213 deaths in the Nairobi bombing.","331":"The group consists mostly of men who had joined Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and suspected terrorist, in fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's.","332":"The incident was cited by prosecutors yesterday in their effort to persuade the jury in Federal District Court to impose the death penalty on Mr. Mohamed, who was convicted of 11 counts of murder in the Tanzania attack and also of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans.","334":"An F.B.I. agent told the jury that the notes had been found in the Metropolitan Correctional Center cell that was shared by two men who were then awaiting trial on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, in a global terrorism conspiracy that included the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","335":"MADRID, June 22\u2014 Spanish police officers today arrested an Algerian man who was wanted on terrorism charges in France and Germany, and who is thought to have ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused by the United States of masterminding the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","336":"Officials speculated that the threat might be related to the Khobar Towers indictment, and might involve groups related to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been charged by the United States with leading the conspiracy to blow up two American embassies in East Africa in 1998.","337":"Mr. Sharon is also expected to raise allegations that Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi dissident and accused terrorist, is seeking to establish a network of agents in Israel, his aides said.","338":"Memo From: Osama bin Laden","339":"Israeli reporters wanted to follow up on the minister's remarks earlier, when he had suggested that Osama bin Laden, the accused terrorist, was trying to infiltrate Israel, and when he urged the dismantling 15 illegal settlement outposts.","34":"It was not clear yesterday how Ms. White and a committee of prosecutors who examined the case viewed such issues. Nor was it known whether Ms. White's office considered how a death penalty prosecution would play out in Islamic countries that the United States is seeking to enlist in the effort to arrest and bring to trial the suspected mastermind of the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden. He has been living in Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban.","340":"Prosecutors may try to draw connections between the cell of Algerians and other terrorist activities believed to be sponsored by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, who is believed to be living in Afghanistan. The United States attorney's office in Manhattan made that link in its separate case against the four men recently convicted in the conspiracy that led to the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","341":"'I read that you said that you would not let Osama bin Laden dictate to the U.S.,' Sharon told Bush, and then made the point he came to the White House to press home: 'Everyone has his bin Laden. Arafat is our bin Laden.'","342":"During cross-examination, a prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, raised questions about the genuineness of Mr. Mohamed's remorse and the depth of Dr. Post's knowledge about the group led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","343":"'It will hurt me; he is my son,' said Hideya Rubeya Juma, the mother of Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, who was convicted last month on 11 counts of murder in the attack in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and also of conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in a plot to kill Americans around the world.","344":"The defendant, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, sat quietly in court as his fate was being debated. Mr. Mohamed was convicted on May 29 of bombing the American Embassy in Tanzania, which killed 11 people, and of conspiring in a terrorism plot with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. The jury must now consider whether Mr. Mohamed should be put to death.","345":"An Algerian convicted of trying to carry out a terrorist attack in Los Angeles on the eve of the millennium celebration testified yesterday that he had received money and training at camps in Afghanistan that American officials say were run by Osama bin Laden.","347":"Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian convicted of trying to carry out a terrorist attack in the United States on the eve of the millennium, testified that he got money and training at camps in Afghanistan that American officials say were run by Osama bin Laden. Mr. Ressam testified in federal court in Manhattan at the trial of Mokhtar Haouari, another Algerian accused of providing money and support to blow up the Los Angeles airport. A1","348":"But the trial is receiving widespread attention not because of Mr. Haouari's alleged role, but because of Mr. Ressam's appearance. After he was convicted in April of participating in an act of international terrorism, he broke a long silence and agreed to cooperate with the government. Mr. Ressam is one of the few Islamic terrorists to publicly disclose details about camps in Afghanistan that United States officials say are run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has financed terrorist plots around the world, or about plans made by the camps' graduates. He is also among the few to be caught on American soil.","35":"The latest 10 include Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi Arabian suspected of masterminding the deadly 1998 bombings of two United States embassies in Africa; Eric Rudolph, who is suspected of six bombings, including fatal ones at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala.; and Agustin Vasquez-Mendoza, charged in the 1994 murder of an undercover anti-drug agent.","352":"Mr. Mohamed was also convicted with his three co-defendants of participating in a global terrorism conspiracy to kill Americans, which prosecutors said was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, and included the embassy attacks.","353":"Michael J. Garcia, a veteran prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, has been nominated by President Bush to be assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement. Mr. Garcia, 39, participated in major prosecutions of terrorism cases, most recently the successful prosecution of four men charged with conspiring with the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","354":"Mr. Haouari is at most a small figure in the terrorist world that investigators are trying to penetrate. Intelligence officials are examining terrorist cells that formed in training camps in Afghanistan in the 1990's and fanned out around the world. They believe that many such cells are sponsored by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of running an international terror network.","355":"The United States wants the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Muslim militancy who is believed to be living under their protection in Afghanistan. And Russia has accused the Taliban of aiding separatists in Chechnya.","356":"* Mr. Rumsfeld's Pentagon said yesterday that it was soon to begin building the Alaska portion of the missile shield, whether the technology works or not. Two weeks ago, in the face of threats by agents of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Rumsfeld hastily withdrew U.S. marines who were exercising in Jordan and also pulled the U.S. Fifth Fleet from its base in the Persian Gulf. Message: We will deploy weapons that don't work against an enemy that doesn't exist, and we will withdraw forces that do work against an enemy that does exist.","357":"Mr. Haouari's trial was highlighted by revelations about what came to be known as the millennium bombing plot. When the would-be bomber, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested at the border on Dec. 14, 1999, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started a sweeping search for suspects and information about the plot. Investigators later came to believe that the plot was linked to a worldwide network of terrorists orchestrated by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile.","358":"Another witness, Grace Paul, said on the tape that if Mr. Mohamed were kept alive, he might be able to help build the case against the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","359":"Still, Mr. Sharon has said that, despite protests from his right, he does not intend to topple Mr. Arafat. He has even acknowledged that he made a mistake in calling Mr. Arafat names like 'murderer,' 'pathological liar' and 'bin Laden,' referring to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy. By contrast, Mr. Netanyahu said tonight that the Palestinian leader was 'much worse' than Mr. bin Laden, because 'he manufactures many more bin Ladens in the form of little children who learn how to blow themselves up in camps that the Palestinian Authority organizes.'","36":"The effect, the lawyers say, would be to damage seriously the government's chances of prosecuting Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi exile who has been accused of leading a terrorist conspiracy that included the embassy attacks and other acts of violence against Americans abroad.","360":"The cooperation is intended to help the Greeks cope with the threat from the country's homegrown left-wing group, called November 17, as well as the potential danger from international organizations like Islamic terrorists financed by Osama bin Laden.","361":"Recently I wrote a memo that the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden might have written to his men, after the Bush team hastily withdrew a contingent of Marines exercising in Jordan following death threats from the bin Laden gang. One day after the column appeared in The Times and on its Web site, I received e-mails from two Marines who had been part of the exercise in Jordan. They were upset about what I had written and they e-mailed me from their ship, the U.S.S. Harpers Ferry, as it sailed away from Jordan, to scold me for suggesting that they were retreating.","362":"The Council, at the urging of the United States and Russia, imposed the embargo to pressure the Taliban into surrendering Osama bin Laden, the militant who the United States says plotted the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","363":"The other expenses have been for the defense of another terrorist who pleaded guilty and two defendants who are still awaiting trial in the bombings conspiracy, which prosecutors say was led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","364":"Four suspected followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier of Islamic militancy, were convicted this year in federal court in New York of carrying out the nearly simultaneous bombings of the American Embassies here and in Tanzania.","365":"Yet as Israelis are murdered and maimed en masse in their own country almost every day, the United States and its allies continue to fly over and drop an occasional payload on a geographically distant terrorist threat, Iraq. The United States has also vowed to pursue the elusive militant Osama bin Laden.","367":"An F.B.I. investigation into the deadly suicide bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen last year has virtually ground to a halt because Yemeni authorities have refused to widen the inquiry to include Islamic militant groups in Yemen. The decision has frustrated American efforts to link the bombing conclusively to Osama bin Laden. A1","368":"The effect of the Yemeni decision has been to frustrate efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to link the bombing conclusively to Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi, who has declared a worldwide 'holy war' on the United States.","369":"The Times had said the refusal essentially prevented investigators from pursuing the F.B.I. suspicion that Osama bin Laden, the Saudi militant who is the bureau's top terrorism suspect, inspired the attack, even if he did not directly organize it.","37":"In 1997, Mr. Ahmed went to the embassy in Nairobi and warned C.I.A. officers about a plot to blow it up, and later told Kenyan interrogators that he was involved in the plan. The Tanzanian government has said that Mr. Ahmed acknowledged links to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is accused of masterminding the bombings.","370":"When Islamic militants chose Yemen for their most audacious attack yet on an American target, the suicide bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Aden last Oct. 12, they chose well. They killed 17 American sailors by catching the United States in a state of political denial, sending Navy ships to re-fuel in a country that the State Department had characterized only months earlier as a 'safe haven' for terrorists. Now, 10 months on, the inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been stymied. With Yemen's network of militant Islamic groups declared off-limits by Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the bureau's chances slipped further away of proving its 'working theory' -- that the Cole attack was the latest directed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian millionaire who has become an icon among Islamic militants for his 'holy war' against the United States. John F. Burns","371":"In the first two weeks, our investigation in Yemen had gone smoothly. Our joint-operations command post was at the Aden Hotel. I had just checked in for the night when a fellow agent handed me a note that changed everything. It read in part, 'Intelligence sources have discovered an immediate and credible threat to personnel in the Aden Hotel.' In the cryptic lexicon of the intelligence community, 'immediate and credible' means 'They're coming for you -- now.' Everyone in the Middle East, from schoolchildren to Osama bin Laden, knew where we were staying. If a suicide bomber wanted to drive a truckload of explosives right up to the concierge desk, there wasn't a thing we could do about it.","372":"Americans know the principle well. To cite but one example, they were convinced two decades ago that their best interests lay in supporting Islamic fundamentalists battling a Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan. The ascendancy of the Taliban, and the shelter it offers Osama bin Laden, shows how well that strategy turned out in the long run.","373":"Only three nations recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government, he reminded the group, and the United Nations has imposed economic sanctions, insisting that Afghanistan no longer play host to the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden. But, he complained, what happens when the Taliban comply with the world's difficult requests? The growing of poppy plants has been banned in Afghanistan but little has been done to provide farmers with replacement income.","374":"If the would-be assassins were indeed Arabs, as the United Front asserted, the fact would lend credibility to those who contend that foreigners, including Osama bin Laden, are playing an ever bigger decision-making role among the Taliban.","375":"But the most ominous pattern of mass terrorist killings in the 1990's has been traced to the Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden and his allies.","376":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 12\u2014 In a series of statements on Tuesday night, this nation's Taliban rulers, hosts to the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden, condemned the attacks on America and said that their notorious guest was not involved.","377":"One of those certain to be high on that list, Osama bin Laden, has made America's helplessness in the face of terrorism a rallying cry, one he has used repeatedly to taunt the United States and to draw new recruits to his ranks of suicide bombers. People close to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, where he lives, today denied responsibility for the attacks.","378":"The cruise missiles fired into Afghanistan at Osama bin Laden's men after the bombing of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 were weapons chosen to avoid the risk of American casualties, not ensure the destruction of terrorists.","379":"He said investigators would be pulling in potential witnesses to try to determine what happened. Boston authorities also said today they were trying to ferret out whether the terrorist group had plotted its attack while in Boston, and noted that Boston had already been a chosen center of operations for two men linked to the terrorist Osama bin Laden.","38":"WASHINGTON, March 21\u2014 United States officials said today that President Clinton's plan to visit a Bangladeshi village this week was canceled after a terrorist threat possibly linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been accused of terrorism.","381":"Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. But the scale and sophistication of the operation, the extraordinary planning required for concerted hijackings by terrorists who had to be familiar with modern jetliners, and the history of major attacks on American targets in recent years led many officials and experts to point to Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant believed to operate out of Afghanistan. Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban rulers rejected such suggestions, but officials took that as a defensive measure.","382":"As for the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, they were, well, far away -- a rebuke to lax embassy security, an opportunity to freshen up our speculative portraits of Osama bin Laden, but a distant horror. Did it register that new elements were creeping into the terrorist modus operandi, that what had previously seemed crudely opportunistic now had a new measure of logistics, and a more surprising range of potential targets?","383":"His mention of the terrorists and the countries they operate from were the closest the White House would come to assigning blame for the attacks. Intelligence officials said they strongly believed that Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization was behind the attacks. But Afghanistan and administration officials insisted there was no hard evidence to connect Mr. bin Laden to today's attacks.","384":"In arguing against an Arab link, officials and local experts on extremist groups pointed to the complex choreography of the attack. But in the Middle East, as elsewhere, intense speculation focused on Osama bin Laden or related organization, partly because the attacks involved suicide pilots. Suicide bombers from extremist Muslim organizations generally believe that they are fighting for their faith and are promised paradise if they die for the cause.","385":"Mr. Putin in recent months has called on the Bush administration to join Russia in combating terrorist groups in Afghanistan and Central Asia, including that of Osama bin Laden. Russia gives clandestine aid to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, which has been fighting the Taliban. On Sunday, an alliance leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was reportedly wounded by a bomb.","386":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Sept. 12\u2014 In a series of statements on Tuesday night, this nation's Taliban rulers, hosts to the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden, condemned the attacks on America and said that their notorious guest was not involved.","387":"One of those certain to be high on that list, Osama bin Laden, has made America's helplessness in the face of terrorism a rallying cry, one he has used repeatedly to taunt the United States and to draw new recruits to his ranks of suicide bombers. People close to Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, where he lives, today denied responsibility for the attacks.","388":"The missing included one of the country's top counterterrorism experts, John P. O'Neill, the 49-year-old former special agent in charge of national security in the F.B.I.'s New York office, who oversaw the investigation of what the authorities called a global terrorism conspiracy led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, including the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa. Mr. O'Neill retired from the F.B.I. last month and was named director of security for the World Trade Center.","389":"The hijackers were followers of Osama bin Laden, officials say. A1","39":"American officials said Mr. Clinton's plan to visit a Bangladeshi village this week had been canceled after a terrorist threat that was possibly linked to Osama bin Laden. A18","390":"First we have to prove that we are serious, and that we understand that many of these terrorists hate our existence, not just our policies. In June I wrote a column about the fact that a few cell-phone threats from Osama bin Laden had prompted President Bush to withdraw the F.B.I. from Yemen, a U.S. Marine contingent from Jordan and the U.S. Fifth Fleet from its home base in the Persian Gulf. This U.S. retreat was noticed all over the region, but it did not merit a headline in any major U.S. paper. That must have encouraged the terrorists. Forget about our civilians, we didn't even want to risk our soldiers to face their threats.","391":"Mr. Bush must also seek cooperation from responsible Arab and Islamic governments, just as his father did in preparing to drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. A particularly difficult challenge is posed by Pakistan, a traditional American ally that now acts as unofficial patron to Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. The Taliban is believed to be sheltering the most dangerous international terrorist, Osama bin Laden. Although no conclusive evidence has yet linked Mr. bin Laden to this week's attacks, he is among the chief suspects. Washington made clear yesterday that its patience with Pakistan is rapidly running out.","392":"The accused terrorist Osama bin Laden has found a home here, angering much of the world. In 1998, America fired a volley of more than 70 cruise missiles at guerrilla training camps reportedly operated by the Saudi multimillionaire. Now, there seems to be the prospect of another barrage, with Afghan hospitality to the same man as the cause.","393":"Any military action carries political consequences as well as risks to the fighting forces, and there is never a guarantee of success, as the United States found out when it tried to retaliate against the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden for the bombing of two United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","394":"While Muslims' lives were clearly changed, also changed were the lives of people who had nothing to do with the Islamic world but who might appear alien to untutored American eyes. Indian women chose not to wear their flowing, pajama-tunic outfits. Sikh men, with their religiously prescribed beards and turbans, reported being accosted. They said they were apparently being mistaken as followers of Osama bin Laden, pictured on television with a turban of a different sort. In Providence, R.I., yesterday, a Sikh man in a turban was pulled off a Boston-to-Washington train by the police. In Richmond Hill, Queens, one Sikh man was beaten with a baseball bat; two others were shot at with a paint-ball gun. Police arrested two men.","395":"AFGHANISTAN -- Fears grew in Afghanistan that the United States would attack the country for giving refuge to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding terror. Foreign aid workers, fearing retaliation if the United States did attack, began to leave.","396":"'At this time of the day, I usually have one or two shooters,' Mr. Keefe said at midmorning. 'Today I have eight. I had people who said, yeah, they would like to put up a picture of Osama bin Laden and go to work.'","397":"AFGHANISTAN -- Fears grew in Afghanistan that the United States would attack the country for giving refuge to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding terror. Foreign aid workers, fearing retaliation if the United States did attack, began to leave.","399":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 12\u2014 The hijackers who commandeered commercial jets that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were followers of Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant who has been blamed for some of the bloodiest attacks against Americans, federal authorities said today.","4":"Waking up in the year 2000 to face nothing worse than the debris in Times Square, some may have decided that Washington had hyped the prospect of an attack by Osama bin Laden and his allies beyond reason.","40":"Today, some of those same warriors have shifted the focus of their battle to India and America. Among them is Osama bin Laden, whom the United States considers responsible for bombing two of its embassies in 1998. Mr. bin Laden's name will surely come up in the talks between Mr. Clinton and General Musharraf on Saturday. Mr. bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan, with the ruling Taliban militia as his host. Washington has been disappointed in Pakistan's reluctance to use its influence with the Taliban to press for Mr. bin Laden's expulsion or arrest.","400":"To that end, the administration today began to apply pressure to Pakistan, a country that has been accused of providing support for Osama bin Laden and giving his militant Islamic organization the freedom to operate. The director of the Pakistani Interservices Intelligence, Gen. Mahmoud Ahmad, who happened to be here on a regular visit of consultations, was called into the State Department today to meet with Deputy Secretary Richard L. Armitage.","401":"The authorities have not determined what help the hijackers might have had from people living in the Boston area. The militant Islamic leader Osama bin Laden, who has vowed a holy war against the United States, has ties to some people in this region who federal investigators believe were part of a terrorist cell.","402":"Law enforcement agencies were also looking at other potential suspects in the area. The Daytona police said one man was questioned and had his car impounded. The car had a photograph of a Middle Eastern leader, thought incorrectly to be Osama bin Laden. The police said the man was released and is not a suspect at this time.","403":"All of those principles were at work when the Clinton administration struck at Osama bin Laden, the architect of the 1998 bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the suspected sponsor of the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","404":"Q. Mr. President, how confident are you that Osama bin Laden is behind these attacks? Do you know what his whereabouts are? And, secondly, what kind of support are you looking for from Congress, in terms of your willingness to act?","405":"'Bury Osama bin Laden with a pigskin, donate blood for the people in New York and God bless this great country,' he said.","406":"AFGHANISTAN -- Radio Shariat said the Taliban was ready to hand over Osama bin Laden to 'one of the Islamic courts of the world' if Washington could prove his involvement in the attacks in the United States. More than 100 foreign aid workers left in anticipation of a possible American military strike.","407":"The Bush administration singles out Osama bin Laden as the force behind the terror attacks on New York and Washington, and it vows a comprehensive military campaign to demolish terror networks and topple the regimes that harbor them. A1","408":"Such a campaign could involve American forces in protracted fighting against a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and even Pakistan, which occupies a vital strategic position south of Afghanistan, where the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden is believed to be based.","409":"Many Arabs had been hoping that some last-minute disclosure would link the attacks to anarchist groups in the United States. But with increasing signs that indicated Middle East ties, specifically to the violent Muslim fundamentalist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, there was an expectation that the United States would seek revenge.","41":"Mr. Clinton asked the general to take action against terrorist groups operating in Pakistan and to help pressure the Taliban government in Afghanistan to bring to justice, Osama bin Laden, the terrorist whom the United States believes is responsible for the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa.","411":"Such a campaign could involve American forces in protracted fighting against a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and even Pakistan, which occupies a vital strategic position south of Afghanistan, where the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden is believed to be based.","412":"Many Arabs had been hoping that some last-minute disclosure would link the attacks to anarchist groups in the United States. But with increasing signs that indicated Middle East ties, specifically to the violent Muslim fundamentalist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, there was an expectation that the United States would seek revenge.","413":"These terrorists must be rooted out and destroyed. But it must be done in a way that doesn't make us Osama bin Laden's chief recruiter. Because these Muslim terrorists did not just want to kill Americans. That is not the totality of their mission. These people think strategically. They also want to trigger the sort of massive U.S. retaliation that makes no distinction between them and other Muslims. That would be their ultimate victory -- because they do see the world as a clash of civilizations, and they want every Muslim to see it that way as well and to join their jihad.","414":"If they ruled a state they would have something to lose: their state would be militarily punished and they would be evicted from power. That is what we call war. Terrorists cannot defeat a state in war. They can only weaken it from within by attacking its most vulnerable point: ordinary people. All modern terrorist movements -- the I.R.A., the Tamil Tigers, the Muslim militants inspired by Osama bin Laden -- use this tactic.","416":"A few lawmakers were demanding a full declaration of war against international terrorism. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said Congress might want to consider a declaration of war against Afghanistan for having harbored Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant whose associates, authorities believe, commandeered the jets that struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","417":"Intelligence officials believe the attacks were organized by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has been implicated in a series of bloody assaults against Americans.","418":"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell yesterday identified Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has taken refuge in Afghanistan, as the prime suspect in engineering the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. That has put the focus of potential retaliation in central Asia, though that could change if the United States concluded that an Arab country had provided support.","419":"'It's not possible to seize him and bring him to trial,' Mr. Bayh said, referring to Osama bin Laden if he turns out to be culpable. 'You can argue that a more targeted approach may be in order.'","42":"'Maybe he's not coming,' said Usman Ghani, one of the people watching at the store. 'Maybe he's afraid Osama bin Laden is waiting on the runway.'","420":"NEW DELHI, Sept. 13\u2014 The terrorist attacks on the United States appear increasingly likely to touch off a moment of reckoning for Pakistan, which has long supported the fundamentalist Taliban militia in Afghanistan, protector of the United States' prime terrorist suspect, Osama bin Laden.","421":"Afghanistan is the principal base camp and sanctuary for Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the terrorist attacks. But any American effort to deal with the bin Laden organization will inevitably touch on the concerns of other nations that share this troubled neighborhood, including Pakistan, India, Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Washington's initiatives will be more effective if they take account of the interests, and where possible enlist the support, of these regional powers. Ill-conceived or -executed policies can easily backfire. Much of Afghanistan's current lawlessness is due to the past mistakes of Russia, Pakistan and the United States.","422":"With his gentle eyes, skeletal frame, long black beard and habitual Kalashnikov, Osama bin Laden has become the world's most reviled symbol of terror.","423":"German officials said there was no evidence so far that directly linked the suspects to Osama bin Laden, the militant Islamic leader who is a Saudi exile.","424":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 13\u2014 The Bush administration today singled out Osama bin Laden, the Islamic militant who operates from Afghanistan, as a prime suspect in Tuesday's catastrophic terror attacks and vowed a comprehensive military campaign to demolish terrorist networks and topple regimes that harbor them.","425":"On Wednesday, the 19 members of NATO took the unprecedented step of invoking a mutual defense clause. NATO officials denied a report in the British newspaper The Guardian saying that the alliance had already drawn up a plan to invade Afghanistan, the refuge of Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi suspected of having planned Tuesday's attacks.","426":"Pakistan borders Afghanistan, which has harbored the Islamic terrorist who may have directed this week's attacks, Osama bin Laden. Pakistan has been the principal supporter of the fanatic group that now controls most of Afghanistan, the Taliban. It would matter a lot if General Musharraf really changes sides. But will he really be able to, given the influence of Islamic extremists in Pakistan?","427":"Without Pakistan, the Taliban, who play host to the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden, would never have swept across Afghanistan and succeeded in imposing their purified and regressive form of Islam.","428":"Among Mr. Massoud's followers, the attack in which he was wounded has been attributed to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist leader suspected in the attacks that caused devastation in New York and Washington on Tuesday. The Massoud aides said the bomb, concealed in a camera or in a body belt worn by one of the attackers, bore the hallmarks of a bin Laden operation.","429":"Despite evidence suggesting that some of those who carried out the massive attack on the United States this week might have been Saudi citizens or at least linked to another former Saudi resident, Osama bin Laden, it remains to be seen to what extent the kingdom will aid the United States in taking on his shadowy movement. Some Saudi officials noted that names bandied about this week as armed and dangerous men and even suicide pilots turned out to be average Saudi citizens sitting quietly home in Jidda and Mecca, their flight training over.","43":"AMMAN, Jordan, March 28\u2014 Jordan today indicted 28 Arabs linked to the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden on charges stemming from what officials say was a conspiracy to attack Americans and Israelis during New Year's celebrations.","430":"For now, at least, the one state where American military power might be effectively used is Afghanistan, where the Taliban-led government is host to Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in Tuesday's attack. But removing the Taliban from power and hunting down Mr. bin Laden's Afghanistan-based followers would be no easy task, even for America's powerful armed forces.","431":"Tough talk from a Taliban leader in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden has found protection. A17","432":"As American attention turns inexorably toward the Taliban -- which rules most of Afghanistan, is supported by Pakistan and shelters Osama bin Laden -- Indian and American officials have held a flurry of meetings. In the event of an attack, it is expected that India would share intelligence on the location of Afghan and Pakistani training camps, and offer access to Indian military bases where American aircraft could refuel.","433":"'If America is now pointing fingers at us, it will be the third imperialistic attack on our country,' he said. 'During the British and Russian invasions of years past, there was no Osama bin Laden or Taliban, so don't blame Osama. I swear by Allah that if we hand over Osama, even then the Americans will look for excuses to attack.'","434":"Experts called it too early to say what the demographic differences might mean about the shifting dynamics of international terrorism. Perhaps, they said, loyalty to Osama bin Laden is even more powerful than the religious and nationalist fanaticism that has been behind other suicide attacks. Perhaps the size of the target attracted more sophisticated candidates. Or perhaps the hatred of the United States and Western culture is seeping into a broader spectrum of the world's disaffected populations.","435":"At the same time, the trail of terror -- much of it, officials say, either directly organized or inspired by Osama bin Laden -- shows a remarkable coherence in structure and operations that is frustrating government efforts to extinguish the threat.","436":"And the realization that all our security systems failed. Terrorists could live among us as a fifth column, drinking beer in our bars and getting Americans to unwittingly train them to kill other Americans -- even when they drove a car sporting a pro-Osama bin Laden sticker.","438":"The prime suspect in the attacks, Osama bin Laden, probably was right when he told an interviewer that if he were killed, many new bin Ladens would take his place. His death would only promote him from leader to martyr.","439":"Mr. Bush identified Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire harbored in Afghanistan by its radical fundamentalist government, as a 'prime suspect' in the attacks that may have killed more than 5,000 people.","44":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, April 2\u2014 A Yemeni man suspected of having links to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile wanted in the bombing of two American Embassies in Africa, was arrested today trying to cross into neighboring Afghanistan, Pakistani officials said.","440":"First, United States intelligence must isolate, to the satisfaction of the partners in the coalition that it is working frantically to build, the party or parties behind the attacks. If, as seems likely, the target turns out to be the elusive Osama bin Laden, the United States will have to pinpoint his whereabouts, not only today but tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, because he moves every 24 to 48 hours. At the moment, the capacity to do that appears to be lacking.","441":"First, United States intelligence must isolate, to the satisfaction of the partners in the coalition that it is working frantically to build, the party or parties behind the attacks.

At the moment, the capacity to do that appears to be lacking.","442":"THEN, too, only economic engagement will transform the environment in which terrorists thrive, analysts say. Osama bin Laden and others prefer to live where people are poor and governments have failed, Afghanistan most notably. Military action may take out individual terrorists, but won't alter the conditions that help to produce them.","443":"Osama bin Laden and the organization of a terror network. 18","444":"He also faces the prospect of a direct confrontation with the Taliban, who harbor the terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden and who today threatened 'a massive attack' by its Islamic warriors if Pakistan offers the United States any assistance.","445":"HIJACKERS HAD BEEN SOUGHT -- Two of the hijackers had been known as associates of Osama bin Laden and were being sought by investigators in the United States.

It occurred two days before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","447":"For some time, executives and directors said, films and television programs involving terrorism and explosions and threats to civilians are out of the question. For example, a five-hour 'Law and Order' mini-series scheduled for May about a biological warfare attack in New York has been canceled, one of numerous projects that are being dropped, delayed or remade because of the terrorist attacks. A reference to the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden in a new CBS drama about the C.I.A., 'The Agency' has been removed.","448":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 15\u2014 Two of the men believed to have hijacked the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on Tuesday were known to the authorities as associates of Osama bin Laden and had been sought in the United States since August by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, law enforcement and intelligence officials said today.","449":"That threat comes mostly from Afghanistan and the ruling Taliban, the same group that is suspected of having sheltered Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the terrorist attacks this week.","45":"The police raided an apartment in northeast Pakistan, seized forged passports and arrested two men on suspicion of having links with the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, intelligence officials said.

The Web site encouraged supporters to send money to a bank in Pakistan, providing account numbers. And it urged believers to join the movement and apply their skills in 'training camps, refugee camps and battlefronts.'","452":"There is evidence that true terrorists are more circumspect. According to security experts, Osama bin Laden and his followers do not trust the Internet, and pass the most important messages face to face.","453":"Osama bin Laden operates training camps and has a worldwide network of followers who execute his murderous plans. All this takes large sums of money, which he inherited from his wealthy family. You report that much of it, now frozen, is in United States and allied banks.","454":"Mr. Rabbani called Mr. Massoud a 'national hero' who had martyred himself in jihad, or holy war. Without citing evidence, he claimed the assassination had been a 'conspiracy involving Pakistan, the terrorist group of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.'","455":"In Hamburg itself, a city of 1.7 million with some 80,000 Muslims, there are about 2,450 extremist foreigners, only 270 identified in the report as Iranian or Arab. According to the report, the Palestinian group Hamas does significant fund-raising here, and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization has individual members, relying 'on personal contacts and a global network structure.' On Dec. 26 last year, the German police announced a blow against Mr. bin Laden, arresting four men in Frankfurt on terrorism charges and seizing an arsenal of rifles, handguns, machine guns, homemade detonators, a grenade, false documents and a quantity of potassium permanganate for potential bomb-making. The police, who passed on information to Britain and France that later led to further arrests in London, said the men had received training in Mr. bin Laden's camps.","456":"Speaking on the NBC program 'Meet the Press,' Mr. Cheney echoed other senior officials in declaring that nations harboring terrorists like Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in last week's attacks, would face 'the full wrath of the United States.'","457":"The administration, however, is preparing a powerful military strike if the Taliban, as expected, refuse to hand over the terrorist Osama bin Laden and shut down his terrorist network.","458":"Pakistan will send high-ranking military officers to Afghanistan today to demand that the Taliban government arrest Osama bin Laden and his top associates and hand them over to the United States.

Sure enough, with our secret aid and with the help of adventurous Muslim volunteers from all over -- including one rich young Saudi named Osama bin Laden -- the Afghans stunned the world by breaking the will of the Red Army. Our spymaster was prescient: that demoralizing, decade-long military defeat did begin the end of Communism's evil empire.","464":"We would be surprised if these guidelines were the reason there was no warning about last week's attacks. The more likely explanation is that intelligence agencies, with White House and Congressional concurrence, have neglected the cultivation of foreign informants in recent decades in favor of valuable but extremely expensive technical collection systems like spy satellites. These technologies, which can intercept millions of intercontinental phone calls and show a license plate from 200 miles out in space, have served the nation well. They cannot, however, tell the president what Osama bin Laden said yesterday to his henchmen in a mud hut in the mountains of Afghanistan.","465":"Extension Activities:1. Create a profile of Osama bin Laden (this may take one of many forms, such as a video, an essay, or a poster). Address the following questions in your profile: Where did or does bin Laden get his money? What is his military training? Why was he exiled from Saudi Arabia? With what terrorist attacks has he been associated? What public statements has he made against the United States or other countries? 2. Do you think that it is appropriate to \u201creturn to a state of normalcy\u201d now, or is it too soon for people to completely recover from these events? What do you think \u201cnormalcy\u201d will come to mean? Write a letter to the editor of your school or local paper explaining your position. (You might also submit a letter to The Learning Network for possible publication on the site at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/leetters/submit.html.) 3. Explore ways in which your school community can help those directly affected in the attacks. Consider a story you have heard in the news that moved you, and organize a service project so that you and your classmates can respond to help the people involved (some suggestions include food or clothing drives, letter-writing campaigns and fundraisers). 4. What is a \u201chero\u201d? Describe in words the characteristics that comprise a hero. Your response may take many forms, such as a poem, a short story, or a journal. You may want to focus on specific acts of heroism you have heard about or witnessed since the terrorist attacks took place, or offer more general descriptions of a hero. 5. Read the story \u201cOn the Rainy River\u201d from the book \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d by Tim O\u2019Brien. Write an essay defending or challenging O\u2019Brien\u2019s final decision to go to war. Would you go to war if you were drafted tomorrow? Why or why not? How are your reasons different than or similar to Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s? 6. Research draft policies in your country (if you country does not have a draft, research one that does). Write an essay that answers the following questions: When was the last draft in your country? Who is eligible to be drafted? What are the penalties for \u201cdraft dodging\u201d? Why does this country have a draft?","466":"Mr. Omar, who runs the De Afghanan Fine Kabob and Tandoori House, and his brother, Wais, a manager at a Silicon Valley electronics company, plan to distribute posters that show an X across the face of Osama bin Laden, who is the prime suspect in Tuesday's attacks.

Innumerable Islamic terrorists are ready to fill their shoes. It is not enough to wipe out Afghanistan.

But there are other terrorists in the world. There are people who hate freedom.","474":"The high point of the recovery, whether by coincidence or not, came a few minutes before the first report that President Bush wanted to capture Osama bin Laden, dead or alive.

Lenzner, chairman of Investigative Group International, a corporate security concern, said increased surveillance of the flow of money might have prevented the attacks by identifying people who had received money from Osama bin Laden or other terrorists.","481":"Perhaps even more than Muslims, Sikhs in the United States have been singled out for harassment since the terrorist attacks, perhaps because the long beards and turbans prescribed by their Indian religion give them a visual resemblance to the terrorist Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.","482":"If the United States is to win the war against terrorism, it must really win two major battles. The first is to capture or eliminate terrorist organizations like Osama bin Laden's.

Mr. Bush's comments may also create unrealistic expectations at home about what American military forces can do over the short run. Finding and capturing Osama bin Laden will be difficult without the cooperation of Afghanistan, and even the president may not know exactly how that can be accomplished.

'We all made fun of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War.'","503":"I am so used to thinking about myself as a New Yorker that it took me a few days to begin to see myself as a stranger might: a Muslim woman, an outsider, perhaps an enemy of the city. Before last week, I had thought of myself as a lawyer, a feminist, a wife, a sister, a friend, a woman on the street. Now I begin to see myself as a brown woman who bears a vague resemblance to the images of terrorists we see on television and in the newspapers. I can only imagine how much more difficult it is for men who look like Mohamed Atta or Osama bin Laden.","504":"That resolution imposed stern sanctions on the Afghan rulers and demanded, among other things, the handover of Osama bin Laden, at that time for the August 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in Africa. Mr. bin Laden is now also wanted for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","505":"But the nation's Sikhs, conspicuous in turbans that resemble the head wrap of suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, have suddenly found themselves particularly vulnerable. By yesterday afternoon, more than 200 Sikhs had reported incidents to a Sikh anti-defamation group. Newspapers around the country have reported that Sikh temples in Cleveland and West Sacramento were vandalized and, in San Mateo, Calif., a gasoline bomb was thrown through the window of a Sikh family's home, hitting a 3-year-old on the head, but not exploding.","506":"Republicans have also moved to reach out to Democrats inside and outside Congress, not just for support against Osama bin Laden, but to seek their ideas. The most public example was the appearance today of Robert E. Rubin, secretary of the treasury under President Bill Clinton, before leaders from both parties to discuss what the government should do to stimulate the economy.","507":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 19\u2014 Federal agents searching for a suspected operative of Osama bin Laden have arrested three men in Detroit after a search of their house uncovered airport-employee identification badges and a date book with hand-drawn diagrams of aircraft and runways.","508":"A six-year struggle to uncover Osama bin Laden's financial network failed because American officials did not skillfully use the legal tools they had, did not realize they needed stronger weapons, and faced resistance at home and abroad, officials involved in the effort say.","509":"Federal agents seeking a suspected operative of Osama bin Laden have arrested three men in Detroit after a search of their house found a diagram of aircraft. PAGE B2","51":"The terrorist problem in South Asia involves privately sponsored groups motivated less by political grievances than by religion and ideology, which are not amenable to negotiation. The most notorious of these organizations is led by Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi-born financier suspected of masterminding the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people. Mr. bin Laden remains at large in Afghanistan, sheltered by the Taliban, which he supports financially. He also leads a militia with thousands of fundamentalist fighters that defends the Taliban against northern Afghan insurgents.","510":"One of the men who knows this countryside the best is Osama bin Laden. He first came to Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation to support the guerrillas, a cause that was also championed by the United States.","511":"Some senior administration officials, led by Paul D. Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defense, and I. Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, are pressing for the earliest and broadest military campaign against not only the Osama bin Laden network in Afghanistan, but also against other suspected terrorist bases in Iraq and in Lebanon's Bekaa region.","512":"In Union Square Park, which has become an outdoor memorial to loss and grief, peace signs, antiwar slogans and pleas for nonviolence far outnumber demands for retribution. The equestrian statue of George Washington charging into battle has been transformed into a monument of antiwar sentiment, and although there are a handful of wanted posters featuring Osama bin Laden, there are far more that say, 'Mourn the Victims, Stand for Peace' or 'An eye for an eye creates blindness.'","513":"President Bush ordered heavy bombers and other aircraft to move to within easy striking distance of Afghanistan. He repeated his demand that the Taliban rulers there turn over Osama bin Laden and other suspected leaders of the terror group believed to be behind the attacks on New York and Washington last week. Mr. Bush will address Congress tonight. A1","514":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 19\u2014 Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, went on nationwide television tonight to offer a tense, sometimes emotional defense of his decision to join the United States in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. General Musharraf said the situation presented this volatile Muslim nation of 140 million people with its gravest crisis in the 30 years since it lost its last major war, with India.","515":"Pakistan has become crucial to the American campaign to root out Osama bin Laden, the leading suspect is the terrorist attacks. Turkey is a NATO ally that straddles Europe and the Middle East and joined the United States during the Persian Gulf war.","516":"Why are Afghans not told that their rulers' decision to hide Osama bin Laden is the direct cause of the withdrawal of U.N. relief and the starvation that they now face?","517":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 19\u2014 President Bush ordered heavy bombers and other aircraft to within easy striking distance of Afghanistan today and insisted that its ruling Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden and other suspected leaders of a terrorist organization believed to be behind last week's attacks in New York and Washington.","518":"Not too far from Conte, near the paddock, a group of men held a lively discussion. Instead of the usual intense debate about pace and speed figures, however, the talk was about the rugged terrain of Afghanistan and the elusiveness of Osama bin Laden.","519":"Re 'Bush Orders Heavy Bombers Near Afghans; Demands Bin Laden Now, Not Negotiations' (front page, Sept. 20): The military should not reveal its plans to strike at the enemy. The public and especially Osama bin Laden do not need to know the details of our troop movements. During World War II, we had a slogan, 'Loose lips sink ships.' Can't we keep a few secrets?","52":"Your claim that terrorists in South Asia, like the group said to be headed by Osama bin Laden, are 'motivated less by political grievances than by religion and ideology' is a simplistic interpretation of regional politics.","520":"Whatever the cause, it is a record that makes Pakistan wary of President Bush's new embrace. The biggest danger now is that by overstepping in Pakistan -- using it as a military base for attacks, for example -- the administration could plunge General Musharraf's regime into chaos or even civil war, providing a new opportunity for lethal action by Osama bin Laden and his radical allies. Another risk would be to embolden General Musharraf as a nuclear weapons-toting troublemaker.","521":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 20\u2014 Afghanistan's senior Muslim clerics adjusted their course today, issuing an edict that said Osama bin Laden should be persuaded to leave the country.","522":"Following a trail from Boston to Detroit to Chicago, agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday night arrested a man suspected of ties to last week's terrorist attacks and a bombing plot in Jordan that has also been linked to Osama bin Laden.","523":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20\u2014 President Bush demanded tonight that Afghanistan's leaders immediately deliver Osama bin Laden and his network and close down every terrorist camp in the country or face military attack by the United States.","524":"'Whether it's Osama bin Laden or not,' said Jeremiah McKinley, a 19-year-old sophomore pharmacy student at Florida A &amp; M University in Tallahassee, 'if the president says you have to fight, you have to fight. You have to do what your leader says.'","525":"The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics. A fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teaching of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.","526":"While the clues are sparse, investigators are pursuing this line of inquiry because it follows a pattern seen in previous attacks by Osama bin Laden in which a senior operative arrived on the scene to give instructions to suicide bombers. Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi exile, has been identified as a prime suspect in last week's attacks.","527":"In Indonesia, experts and diplomats say, there is reported involvement by Osama bin Laden, who has been blamed by the United States for last week's terror. An American diplomat said this week that Mr. bin Laden was tied to a serious security threat that caused the embassy in Jakarta to close for several days last fall. The embassy remains on alert.","528":"Then, with a good teacher's magic, he turned every freshman in the room into a proxy of someone or some nation in the unfolding drama: One became Osama bin Laden, another, Pakistan, a third, Saddam Hussein. Mr. Small translated international politics into concepts any ninth grader could understand: a schoolyard brawl, a festering feud, whether citizens have a duty to help those less fortunate than them.","529":"A front-page article yesterday about unsuccessful efforts to trace Osama bin Laden's financial network gave a misspelled surname in some copies for the Massachusetts Democratic senator who is co-sponsor of a bill on money-laundering investigations. He is John Kerry, not Kerrey.","53":"AFGHANISTAN: SPYING FOR U.S. -- An Arab arrested in Afghanistan confessed on videotape that the United States recruited him to find Osama bin Laden, who is accused of terrorism. The Associated Press has reviewed the tape, made by a camera crew working for United Arab Emirates Television. The television reporters said the prisoner also told them he provided information that led to the Taliban's arrest of an American spy. Barry Bearak (NYT)","530":"On a day when American forces were on the move -- ships and planes heading for the Persian Gulf and reservists to stateside posts -- some Americans said they opposed indiscriminate bombing of Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden, the Islamic extremist widely suspected of being behind the attacks, and insisted that the targets be limited to proven terrorists, and that the proof be made public.","531":"Iran has 1.4 million Afghan refugees, most of them in the far east of the country, and announced last Friday -- three days after the terror attacks on the United States and talk of retaliation against the Taliban who harbor Osama bin Laden -- that it was sealing its 560-mile border. Particularly in southern areas, however, that border is hard to control.","532":"But the deadly attack on the World Trade Center last week seems to have ensured that Ms. White, who was appointed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, will not be going anywhere soon. Ever since the first trade center bombing in 1993, Ms. White's office has investigated a succession of major acts of terrorism in New York and around the world, including the activities of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged with leading the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa.","533":"President Bush, in a televised address to Congress, demanded that Afghanistan immediately deliver Osama bin Laden and the rest of his network and close down every terrorist camp in that country or face military attack. He also asked Americans for support and patience in what he said would be a long global struggle against terrorism. A1","534":"Kazakhstan, where Muslims are a slight majority, is struggling to keep out Islamic radicals like those who have been fighting sporadically in neighboring Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for the last two years. Militants in those countries are believed to have been trained in Afghanistan, home to Osama bin Laden, who the United States suspects is behind the attacks in New York and Washington.","535":"In Brussels, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage met with NATO ambassadors, but he offered no proof of a role by Osama bin Laden and indicated that the United States was not ready to make specific requests from allied countries for military support.","536":"Strong, damaging attacks would simply unify Muslim countries against us. Instead, we can use this horrific act to unify Americans and the majority of Muslims, who do not use the Koran to justify the acts of a power seeker intent on world domination. Osama bin Laden will be defeated only if his own Islamic world turns against him.","537":"But Mr. Bush's demands of Afghanistan's Taliban government were expansive. The Taliban must not only turn over Osama bin Laden, he said, but must shut down all terrorist training camps and allow American inspections to make sure they have been closed. These demands are almost certainly not going to be met, and the president vowed that the 'hour is coming when America will act.'","538":"Some in the administration would prefer to focus the campaign more narrowly, concentrating on the operations of Osama bin Laden, the main suspect in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11. That, they argue, would constitute a much more realistic goal -- though still a hard one to achieve -- and make easier the assembly of an extensive, actively engaged international coalition.","539":"William Safire (column, Sept. 20) is exactly right: we should use radio to get the truth directly to the Afghan people. The Afghans do not know that their starvation is the result of their dictators' efforts to protect Osama bin Laden. We allow the Taliban to monopolize all information available to Afghan men, women and children.","54":"The authorities suspect that the conspiracy was masterminded by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban.","540":"The longer-term outlook is hazy. If the United States can capture Osama bin Laden and other terrorists and does not face more attacks like last week's, consumer confidence may begin to recover by the spring, he predicted. With the aid of lower interest rates and increased government spending, the economy could begin to grow quickly as soon as the second quarter of next year.","541":"Meantime, several Israeli officials said they could not confirm published reports that the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, had warned the United States that some 200 people linked to Osama bin Laden were trickling into the country in the weeks before last week's attacks.","542":"Prime Minister Abd al-Qadir Ba Jamal of Yemen announced the detention of 20 men for questioning about their possible links to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi fugitive who is the prime suspect in the attacks.","543":"Such military action became more likely -- and perhaps more imminent -- after the Taliban, the militant Islamic rulers of Afghanistan, today rejected any possibility of delivering the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive with bases in Afghanistan.","544":"Take the external first. The great danger here is that military attacks of too sweeping a character -- by the heavy U.S. bombers already sent to the Middle East, for example -- would play into the hands of the terrorists and their presumed leader, Osama bin Laden.","546":"To him and others, Osama bin Laden is not the first name on their list of suspects. Indeed, they often sound like civil libertarians while speaking in his defense: Where is the proof? Shouldn't there be a trial before a man is wanted dead or alive?","547":"In Afghanistan today, some clerics told their followers that they would be obliged to commit murder against Westerners if the Westerners sought to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who has taken refuge there and is the prime suspect in the American attacks. It is his statements, some clothed as an Islamic edict, or fatwa, that have in the last five years been the primary example of Islam used to justify violence.","548":"Piazza has read numerous articles about Osama bin Laden, and he was animated as he discussed how the United States might react to the attacks. Piazza reiterated that our lives have changed, bowing his head and expressing why he struggled to compare baseball in New York with real life in New York. He hugged some Braves before the game started, a game he made sure will be remembered for a long time.","549":"European writers and intellectuals have pointed to a catalog of actions that include the bombing -- in reprisal for the terrorist bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998 -- of one of Sudan's two pharmaceutical factories on the challenged grounds that it was linked to Osama bin Laden, aid to Israel to buy weapons used against Palestinians, or even the American refusal to intervene to stop the mass killings in Rwanda.","55":"DEARBORN, Mich., May 11\u2014 It was one of the more astonishing political images of the year: a newspaper advertisement that linked Osama bin Laden, the suspected international terrorist, with Senator Spencer Abraham, the Michigan Republican.","550":"In another development, American intelligence officials said today they believed that the assassination of the leader of the anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan on Sept. 9 was probably carried out by associates of Osama bin Laden.","551":"In another development, American intelligence officials said today they believed that the assassination of the leader of the anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan on Sept. 9 was probably carried out by associates of Osama bin Laden.","552":"BIN LADEN IS FIRST TARGET -- A senior official said the 'initial phase' of the American assault on terrorism would be aimed at Osama bin Laden and his network in Afghanistan. The next, broader phase is still in development, the official said. A1","553":"Mr. Straw depicted the trip as part of the efforts to build a coalition against terrorism since the attacks on New York and Washington. The United States and Britain have identified Osama bin Laden, based in Afghanistan, as the prime suspect. 'It's important to build alliances with every country that we can,' Mr. Straw told reporters.","554":"President Bush, in his impassioned speech to the joint meeting of Congress, outlined a course of action to bring Osama bin Laden to justice and reiterated previously expressed intentions to punish countries harboring terrorists. Does this mean declaring war and invading Iraq and Syria, if American intelligence suggests possible involvement in providing assistance to terrorists?","555":"Mr. Bush is currently considering two different variants of a war against terrorism. One would target individuals and countries linked to the Sept. 11 attacks, a list that so far appears limited to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban government in Afghanistan that gives it sanctuary. The other course would extend the fight to countries more broadly linked to international terrorism, possibly including Iraq.","556":"As the United States plans an attack against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime that continues to shelter him, we need to recognize that destroying Afghanistan will accomplish nothing. The Soviets, the Islamic militants we once armed, and the Taliban and their Pakistani backers have already done so. About a third of the capital, Kabul, is as ruined as the World Trade Center.","557":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 21\u2014 A senior Bush administration official said today that the 'initial phase' of the assault on terrorism would be aimed at Osama bin Laden and his network in Afghanistan, but that the scale and timing of the next, broader phase had yet to be worked out.","558":"The sanctions had been imposed on the two countries for their 1998 nuclear tests. The move was seen as a reward for Pakistan's pledge to help the United States in its efforts against Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of backing the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.","559":"Mr. Nazarbayev has said in the past that he had reason to believe that Osama bin Laden, suspected in the attacks on New York and Washington, also had plans to target Kazakhstan. The country is a mostly secular, multiethhnic state with slightly more Muslims than Orthodox Christians, and a tiny and shrinking population of Catholics, mostly from families deported here by Stalin.","56":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM UP/DO NOW (Day 1): In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): From your knowledge of American politics, what do you think a special-interest group is? List issues that you believe special-interest groups might organize around. Name any special-interest groups of which you\u2019ve heard. 2. As a class read and discuss \u201cSpecial-Interest Groups Widening Political Attack Ads,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. Why did the Federation for American Immigration Reform (F.A.I.R.) link Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) with the terrorist Osama bin Laden? b. How did the Michigan Catholic Conference react to the advertisement linking Osama bin Laden with Senator Abraham? c. According to the article, what trend is changing the face of American political advertising? d. What is a special-interest group? e. What is the message in the advertisement that the Handgun Control organization is running in eight cities about the National Rifle Association (N.R.A)? f. According to Darrell West, a Brown University political science professor, when did interest-group ads become a \u201cgrowth industry\u201d? g. How did Harry and Louise advertising effect the Clinton administration\u2019s health care proposals? h. Who sponsored the Harry and Louise ads? i. How can candidates use special-interest group ads to their advantage? j. According to the article, the candidates in the Michigan Senate race have not yet begun advertising, \u201cin any concerted way.\u201d Yet there have been television ads present in the race. What groups have sponsored the television ads? k. The Federation for American Immigration Reform describes their advertising campaign as an effort to defeat immigration legislation. According to the article, how do many other people in Michigan view the federation\u2019s efforts? l. What is the Federation for American Immigration Reform\u2019s main platform? m. Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, says that the federation has always been \u201ccontroversial.\u201d Why? n. How does the federation frame its efforts to defeat Senator Abraham\u2019s immigration bill? o. What would Senator Abraham\u2019s immigration bill allow? p. In the article, Dan Stein, the federation\u2019s executive director, says, \u201cWe are a charitable entity.\u201d We are not interested in affecting the campaign.\u201d What does the Abraham campaign believe about this? q. The federation is a non-profit charity whose donors can receive tax deductions. What does this mean for them when it comes to political candidates and elections? r. What is electioneering? s. What is lobbying? t. As non-profit charities, special-interest groups can engage in lobbying but are barred by the Internal Revenue Service from campaigning for or against political candidates. Why is the Sierra Club given more leeway in campaigns? u. Why are charities so careful to comply with the electioneering ban? v. How has the federation\u2019s advertisements effected the way that the Abraham campaign is being run? 3. As a class, brainstorm political issues that might be taken up by special-interest groups. The list might include issues such as gun control, reproductive choice, immigration, vouchers, etc. Continue the brainstorm by creating a list of special-interest groups that the students may have heard about in the news. Discuss what makes a special-interest group (non-profit status, electioneering ban, etc.). 4. Divide students into small groups. Each group selects an issue and researches the positions of the two major presidential candidates on this issue. Students should also research the special-interest groups that have formed around this issue, noting their size, their constituency, and their messages and activities during the primaries or recent elections. 5. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK: In their groups, students should imagine that they are representatives from a special-interest group and write the transcript of a television attack advertisement, targeting one candidate about his position on one issue. (They might also include a description of the ad\u2019s graphics and sound effects.) Students should keep in mind that as a special-interest group, they may not overtly endorse one candidate over another. Students may use the transcript of the Handgun Control anti-Bush advertisement as an example. (http://handguncontrol.org) 6. WARM UP/DO NOW (Day 2): In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): From what you now know about American politics and special-interest groups, do you think that negative advertisements by special-interest groups are fair? Are they electioneering or lobbying? 7. In their groups, students re-write their advertisement in a positive way, without pointed attacks. Students may want to frame their advertisement as an educational campaign. (They might also include a description of the ad\u2019s graphics and sound effects.) They should keep in mind that as a special-interest group, they cannot overtly endorse one candidate over another. 8. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK (Day 2): In their groups, students finish their advertisements. Individually, students write a reflective essay on the process of writing the advertisements. Students should also address the question of whether special-interest groups should be allowed to continue their pointed campaigns or whether there should be legislation prohibiting their pointed campaigns. At a later date, students may present both their negative and positive advertisements to the class. Where possible, students may film their advertisements. Further Questions for Discussion:\u2013What do you think of when you hear the term \u201cspecial-interest group\u201d? \u2013Why is it so important to special-interest groups to keep their non-profit status? \u2013Are special-interest groups flouting the electioneering ban by running pointedly negative attack ads? \u2013How important do you believe advertising is in political campaigns? \u2013How do you think campaigns have changed since the advent of television advertising? \u2013What do you think an election would be like without any political advertising? Would voters have a chance to learn about the candidates? \u2013Why do you think the author of the article chose to use the term \u201cfederation\u201d when speaking of Federation for American Immigration Reform, rather than their acronym F.A.I.R.? Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and group discussions and thoughtful participation in research and advertisement creation. Vocabulary:astonishing, inveigh, infuriate, antithesis, obscure, ominous, leveling, surrogate, backlash, insulation, ostensibly, unaffiliated, acronym, concerted, virulent, ophthalmologist, moratorium, smorgasbord, hackles, severed, constituent, lobbying, electioneering, scrupulous, refuting Extension Activities:1. The article mentions a number of special-interest groups, individuals and unions by name. Research the history, membership and message of one of the organizations mentioned in the article: Federation for American Immigration Reform, Handgun Control, the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club, Sam and Charles Wyly, AFL-CIO, Right to Life, Americans for Job Security. 2. Campaign Finance reform has been an important issue already this election. What has all the controversy been about? How might Campaign Finance reform effect advertising? How much may candidates spend on advertising? Do special-interest group advertisements subvert this spending cap? 3. Create a pamphlet for a special-interest group of your own invention. What messages would you need to include? What issues are you addressing? How will you entice new members to join or donate money? 4. Write a letter to the editor of your local paper about negative campaign advertising. How do you feel, as a young person, it influences your view of politics and the electoral process? 5. Interview a parent or older friend or relative about their most pervasive memory of a political advertisement. Did the advertisement affect the way they voted? What other ads do they remember? Do they remember any positive advertisements? 6. Keep a journal of political advertisements that you see in print and in the newspapers. How does coverage change as the election grows nearer? What role do special-interest groups play? 7. Television changed the way Americans look at political candidates. Who was the first candidate to appear on television? To use television advertising? How much influence do you think television has on the way candidates campaign? Create a timeline, tracing the influence of television on the American political system. Included in your timeline might be suggestions to each candidate or politician to make himself/herself more \u201ctelegenic\u201d? Interdisciplinary Connections:American History \u2013 Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to appear on television. Dwight David Eisenhower was the first candidate to make a campaign commercial. John F. Kennedy used television to his advantage. Write a report about one of these three men \u2013 what was happening in American history during their presidency? How did they use popular media to get their messages across to the American public? Economics \u2013 Analyze the cost of print versus television versus Internet advertising. Which is most effective, dollar for dollar? Which do you predict will be the most efficient and useful in the future? Geography \u2013 Map the states that are having Senate races this year. Include the candidates and the major issues affecting that state. Global History \u2013 Compare and contrast the electoral process in the United States and another democracy. What role does the media play in the process in other countries? Campaign advertisements? Are there special-interest groups? Math \u2013 How many Senate seats are up this year? How many incumbents are running for re-election? How many seats would it take to transfer the majority from one party to the other? How many Senators are there in total? How many Republicans? Democrats? Independents? Men? Women? Using all of these numbers, write three math problems. Trade problems with a classmate. Teaching With The Times \u2013 Using articles from the New York Times as your guide, trace the controversy over campaign advertising. Is negative advertising a new story? When is coverage of advertising most intense? background: In order to best understand the look and feel of political advertising, students should have the opportunity to view or hear political ads. The Govworks Web Site (http://www.govspot.com/election/campaignads.htm) offers a compendium of national ads, as well as links to other advertising libraries on the Web. Students should always consider where they receive their information. Other Information on the Web:The New York Times on the Web\u2019s political campaign special (http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/) provides articles and columns about the upcoming elections in 2000, plus maps, polls and links to campaign ads. Dissect an Ad (http://www.pbs.org/pov/totk/dissect.html) from the Center for Media Literacy offers an exercise aimed at getting voters to think critically about Presidential election campaign ads. The :30 Second Candidate (http://www.pbs.org/30secondcandidate/) introduces the world of political advertisements and traces the history of significant political ads, follow the controversial process of creating an ad, and explore the techniques of ad makers.

As Ms. Rice began taking copious notes, a senior White House aide said, Mr. Bush told her that the assault on terrorism would come in phases, opening with a more focused attack on Osama bin Laden, his operation and his Afghan protectors, but eventually encompassing any terrorist operations with the 'global reach' to harm the United States, and the countries that sponsor them.","561":"KUWAIT, Sept. 22\u2014 The United Arab Emirates, one of only three countries to have recognized the Taliban government, broke off relations with Afghanistan today because of its refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden, the terror network chief suspected of masterminding the suicide attacks on New York and Washington.","562":"Throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan and Lebanon, groups with Islamic names -- if not causes -- have been used to pursue neighboring nations' foreign policy aims, to bolster political factions or undermine the security of local people and outside investors. The Saudi government came to fear Osama bin Laden and stripped his citizenship in the hope that he would never return.","563":"But it is Afghanistan that President Bush, in his speech Thursday night, pledged to attack unless it delivered up the terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush warned Americans to expect 'a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have seen,' in his fight against terrorism, and it will certainly be that.","564":"While American officials have blamed Osama bin Laden for the attacks, they are still struggling to connect him directly to the plot. Investigators believe there were many more conspirators, but despite the efforts of thousands of law enforcement and intelligence agents, the authorities have arrested only a handful of suspects in the United States.","565":"Mr. O'Neill spent the last several years heading major investigations of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, a prime suspect in the attacks at the trade center and the Pentagon. He also investigated the bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","566":"Senior administration officials have singled out the ruling Taliban for harboring the terrorist camps used by Osama bin Laden and his network. Both the Taliban itself and the bin Laden forces are likely to be targets of eventual American military action, and there is strong political support in Washington for such a move.","567":"Take Iran. In the 1960's the writer Jalal Al-e Ahmad identified what he called a cultural 'illness' that had stricken the country's cities and towns. He coined a new word to describe it: gharbzadegi -- 'West-stricken-ness,' or 'Westoxication.' He mourned the villager who 'in search of work flees from the village to the town so he can drink Pepsi-Cola and eat a five-rial sandwich and see a Brigitte Bardot film.' No matter that Al-e Ahmad drank alcohol and seldom prayed. The only authentic strain in Iranian culture for him was religion. His message had profound resonance. Two decades later, the elimination of 'Westoxication' was a central goal of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Now Osama bin Laden is accusing Saudi Arabia of becoming Westoxicated by allowing American military forces on its soil.","568":"'Without a doubt, the strength of the I.M.U. is external support,' Michael R. Hickok, an expert on Central Asia at the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, said in an interview. 'Among its supporters are the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.'","569":"Mr. Bush's administration might have been clinging to a cold-war mentality, but America's new foes in Afghanistan are clinging to a medieval mindset in a country so ravaged Clinton officials said they tried to 'bomb them up to the Stone Age' (a bombing that only succeeded in lionizing Osama bin Laden). Women are not allowed to go to school and TV's, music and even kites are banned. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of the Taliban, is reputed to be so crazed that when shrapnel hit his eye in a battle with the Russians, he simply cut it out with a knife and kept going.","57":"The kind of global cooperation required in the future, the president said, was in evidence when the authorities foiled a plan by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile living in Afghanistan, to smuggle explosive materials into the United States before the New Year. Links between Mr. bin Laden's associates and terrorist plots uncovered in Jordan and at the United States-Canadian border have been widely reported, but the president's comments today were his most extensive on the subject.","570":"The leading suspect at the center of the terror campaign is Osama bin Laden. The bin, meaning 'son of,' is not capped; Westerners have chosen not to capitalize the Arabic just as they have often chosen to capitalize the Hebrew Ben, which has the same meaning. This has nothing to do with correctness; it is strictly idiosyncratic convention, varying among regions and stylists. (When starting a sentence with bin Laden's name, Times style calls for capitalizing it, which then looks like a mistake.) Bin Laden has been given a shorthand, bogus title, much like vice overlord, fugitive financier and drug kingpin: his is terrorist mastermind.","571":"As recently as this summer, in a tape that was widely disseminated, Osama bin Laden -- a Saudi exile blamed for numerous anti-American attacks and the prime suspect in the Trade Center assault -- described the cleric as 'a hostage in an American jail.' He added, 'We hear he is sick, and that the Americans are treating him badly.' Then, addressing his followers, he shifted into an exhortation to martyrdom. 'You will not die needlessly,' he said. 'Your lives are in the hands of God.'","572":"Despite repeated attempts by the mayor's press secretary to usher the former president away for a tour of the mayor's command center, Mr. Clinton lingered. He said that in the wake of the bombings of American Embassies in Africa in 1998, he had authorized the arrest and, if necessary, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile the Bush administration says was behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","573":"Fundamentalism is easy to spot when the Rev. Jerry Falwell blames homosexuals and supporters of gay rights for provoking divine retribution in the form of the World Trade Center attack -- as well as AIDS. It's horrifically unmissable when Osama bin Laden bids Muslims everywhere to murder Americans for the glory of Allah. Wasn't Nazism, too, fundamentalist: a cult devoted to the purity of German identity?","574":"In the village, the mood was one of loss and anger. On Tuesday morning, Emanuele Saracino, 47, an employee at the Rye Shoe Store, walked up to a tree in front of the store and with thumbtacks, put up a 'Wanted Dead or Alive' poster of Osama bin Laden. Inside, the staff watched coverage of the collapse, until a customer with two small children quietly asked the store owner to turn it off.","575":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 22\u2014 The United States is sending bulletins to police and intelligence services around the world, trying to create a global network that could help round up 3,000 people in about 30 countries who are suspected of working with Osama bin Laden.","576":"As a colossal manhunt gears up for Osama bin Laden, there are countless theories about his whereabouts. They agree on one thing: that he has left his usual haunts. PAGE B3","577":"The chemicals were mentioned in documents found at the home of the unidentified Tunisian, one of two men arrested last week and suspected of planning anti-American attacks. Investigators stressed that they have not established a link with the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or the chief suspect in those attacks, Osama bin Laden.","578":"Mr. Khankan said that the United States had yet to show evidence linking Osama bin Laden or the ruling Taliban of Afghanistan to the attacks. 'We need to have proof,' he said. 'We need to have facts. If there is something wrong, let's get together through the United Nations, not act as a lynch mob.'","579":"The hijackers, to be sure, left no statements of any sort. But the virulent form of Islamic fundamentalism professed by Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, which was apparently behind the attacks, has focused its hatred on the United States as the chief power and symbol of a despised, secular West.","58":"Furthermore, one of the objects of the Clinton administration's attack -- the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, whom Washington suspects of masterminding the embassy bombings -- is also a nemesis of Russia. Russian officials have charged that bin Laden and Islamic groups are providing weapons and other aid to Chechen rebels.","580":"VERONA, N.J., Sept. 19\u2014 In a corner of the Annin &amp; Company flag factory here, 19 miles from where the World Trade Center once stood, Kishawn Carter, 24, a New Jersey native, works beside Samy Yousef, 45, an immigrant from Egypt, talking about Osama bin Laden, the Middle East and war.","581":"THE SEARCH FOR BIN LADEN -- Now the manhunt begins, on an epic scale, in a vast and forbidding landscape, and for a man whose cunning is internationally renowned. The United States has demanded the handover of Osama bin Laden under threat of American military might, and the Muslim clerics who rule Afghanistan have finally refused. More than that, the bearded men of the Taliban have challenged America to a fight. B3","582":"For those of us watching on television, everything in the last few days has been a disaster movie, complete with explosions, heroes, tragic final phone calls and death. But this movie lurches forward without direction, and for a simple reason: it is missing a worthy monster. In 'King Kong,' we can see the ape on the building, but the monster in our current story is only a rumor. He takes no credit, and we lack an understanding of his motive. We see Osama bin Laden on videotape, always dubbed or narrated, with his spiritually placid eyes, and he is never explained, nor does he explain. Everything about him is vague: his domicile, his army, the source of his power.","583":"Certainly, it seems to me that the idea of an enormous intelligence breakdown is ludicrous; again, this was not like a book, not like a movie; this was men armed with nothing but knives and box cutters relying on simple speed to keep people off balance long enough to accomplish their goals. In the case of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, they failed. With the other three, however, they succeeded quite nicely. Cost of weaponry? Based on what we know now, less than $100. This qualifies them as cut-rate, low-tech, stealth guerrillas flying well under the radar of American intelligence. We must realize this and grasp an even more difficult truth: although it is comforting to have a bogyman, and every child's party needs a paper donkey to pin the tail on, this Osama bin Laden fellow may not have been the guy responsible. It wouldn't hurt to remember that the boys who shot up Columbine High School planned to finish their day by hijacking a jetliner and flying it into -- yes, that's right -- the World Trade Center. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris weren't exactly rocket scientists, and the guys who did this didn't have to be either. All you had to be was willing to die, and these guys were. It could happen again. And now that crazos the world over see that it's possible to get 72 hours of uninterrupted air time on a budget, it will almost certainly happen again.","584":"Mr. Tenet added that operatives of Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire suspected in the Sept. 11 attacks, 'have trained to conduct attacks with toxic chemicals or biological toxins.'","585":"BIN LADEN IS FIRST TARGET -- A senior official said the 'initial phase' of the American assault on terrorism would be aimed at Osama bin Laden and his network in Afghanistan. The next, broader phase is still in development, the official said. A1","586":"The United States has demanded the handover of Osama bin Laden under threat of American military might, and the Muslim clerics who rule Afghanistan, after days of vacillation and obfuscation, have finally refused.","587":"The Bush administration accuses Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi multimillionaire, of orchestrating the plot to attack targets in the United States with hijacked airliners. By focusing on the 19 suspected hijackers, investigators have traced a network of links to Mr. bin Laden, leading back through operatives in the United States and abroad.","588":"Members of the Saudi royal family are also taking seriously threats against their rule from Osama bin Laden, an outcast from one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent families. From exile he has called on Muslims to overthrow the monarchy for allowing in 'infidel' forces. Several terrorists who struck the United States carried Saudi documents, though many may be forged.","589":"Before striking the seat of the Taliban government and Osama bin Laden's suspected hiding places in Afghanistan with bombs, ensuring the hatred of Afghans and other Muslims, let's drop food and news to win their hearts and minds.","590":"Organizing the hijacking of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon took significant sums of money. The cost of these plots suggests that putting Osama bin Laden and other international terrorists out of business will require more than diplomatic coalitions and military action. Washington and its allies must also disable the financial networks used by terrorists.","591":"All six countries have sizable expatriate populations from less privileged Arab countries who often identify with the Palestinian cause and even with the Saudi-born refugee, Osama bin Laden, who is the prime suspect in the attacks.","592":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23\u2014 The Bush administration plans to make public evidence linking Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda network to the terror attacks on the United States in an effort to persuade the world, and particularly Muslim nations, that a military response is justified.","593":"CAIRO, Sept. 23\u2014 Among top lieutenants to Osama bin Laden, several are Egyptians, including a surgeon from Cairo who ranks second in the hierarchy of Mr. bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, and is seen by some intelligence experts as his most likely successor.","594":"In Afghanistan, reports indicated that the Taliban government that has harbored Osama bin Laden was beginning its own preparations for war, ordering troop reinforcements along the border with Pakistan, building new bunkers and installing antiaircraft batteries.","595":"Beyond news organizations in the United States, there is the BBC in Britain, which has cultivated knowledge on terrorist movements. Al-Quds al-Arabi, a London-based Arabic newspaper, and Ha'aretz in Israel have also made such coverage routine. Rahimullah Yusufzai of The News of Pakistan, a part-time correspondent for ABC, the BBC and Time, covers Afghanistan -- whose Taliban government has sheltered Osama bin Laden -- as a local story.","596":"It was important, said Mr. Powell, to follow the president's lead. 'The objective that the president has focused on in this first instance is Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden [and] his presence in Afghanistan. And then we will consider all other options and all other sources of terrorist activity and go after it in an appropriate way.'","597":"Mr. Iversen said Mr. Raissi had an American pilot's license. Relatives told British reporters he had lived in Arizona and had no connection to Osama bin Laden.","598":"The terrorism task force, which is at the forefront of the investigation, includes F.B.I. agents and detectives and investigators from nearly a dozen other law enforcement agencies who have worked together on the major investigations, including the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa. The team also conducted the inquiry that led to the conspiracy indictment of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is the prime suspect in the trade center and Pentagon attacks.","599":"India has accused Pakistani intelligence agents of sponsoring the bombings in Bombay in 1993, a contention Pakistan has always denied. But to get at America's No. 1 suspect, Osama bin Laden, the United States is working with Pakistan, which many Indians regard as the principal incubator of terrorism directed against them.","6":"Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, the former director and senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, say the danger posed by Osama bin Laden and Islamic radicals 'will not fade into memory along with fears of Y2K power failures.' If Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Simon are concerned about extreme terrorism, shouldn't they, too, be concerned about the financing and training of extreme terrorists in the wasteful war we financed in Afghanistan?","60":"Some also channel militants to terrorist groups such as those linked to the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden, who is being sheltered by Afghanistan and whose network has been accused of repeatedly killing Americans.","600":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23\u2014 The Bush administration is backing efforts to build an internal coalition in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban supporters. Such a coalition could collect crucial intelligence, provide political support and cooperate militarily in the war on terrorism.","601":"TELLING THE WORLD -- The Bush administration plans to make public evidence linking Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network to the terror attacks on the United States in an effort to convince the world that a military response is justified. A1","602":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23\u2014 United States intelligence officials said today that they were certain that Osama bin Laden was still in Afghanistan and that they did not believe that he had tried to flee the country for another haven.","603":"Ultimately, though, a great deal hinges on how the American retaliation unfolds. Arab allies of the United States are themselves eager to uproot terrorist networks, like the one run by Osama bin Laden, because they have long feared that such groups could topple their governments.","604":"Among the 27 individuals and organizations on a list attached to the order were three charities that the government believes knowingly or unwittingly channeled money to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network. The groups were Makhtab al-Khidamat, the Wafa Humanitarian Organization and the Al Rashid Trust. [Page B4.]","605":"War on terrorism must go well beyond Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. While I am prepared to be patient and to give our president as much latitude as he needs to proceed, I will consider this war a failure if one year from now Muammar el-Qaddafi still runs Libya and Saddam Hussein still runs Iraq.","606":"The 27 individuals and organizations linked to Osama bin Laden and whose assets President Bush has ordered frozen are only the first cluster of a far larger group of individuals, companies and relief organizations that the United States plans to single out, an administration official said yesterday.","607":"I wonder what Osama bin Laden did in his cave in Afghanistan yesterday?","608":"WHO WAS SINGLED OUT -- Administration officials said that the 27 individuals and organizations whose assets were frozen include the top lieutenants to Osama bin Laden and the entities most directly tied to his Al Qaeda network. B4","609":"As planning proceeded, the chances of avoiding conflict appeared to diminish as belligerent statements were issued in the name of two men certain to be at the top of American priorities: Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist leader wanted in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Muslim cleric who heads the Taliban government in Afghanistan.","61":"If Osama bin Laden were to die tomorrow, the American secretary of state would not be rushing to his funeral. The fact that in this case the terrorist leader happened to have seized and held a country for 30 years should not change anything.","610":"While not ruling out future discoveries, the authorities are saying that to date they have not found evidence of organized groups linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, still operating in the United States, or any direct evidence that the 19 men identified as the hijackers who crashed airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were associated with other groups planning future attacks.","611":"As President Bush assembles and tries to hold together a coalition of disparate nations, he will have to be mindful of Saudi sensibilities -- not only because of traditional Saudi anxieties about aligning itself too closely with the West, but because the kingdom has an unusual role in this conflict. Osama bin Laden comes from a prominent Saudi business family. A principal aim of his worldwide campaign of terror is to evict American troops from Saudi soil and end Washington's decades-long commitment to the defense of Saudi Arabia and its royal family.","613":"Israel, a state that mingles Judaism and democracy, does not thereby placate the likes of Osama bin Laden. And it is difficult to imagine Muslim radicals cozying up to an America that granted its dominant religion, Christianity, a more robust role in public life.","614":"My guidance office has spent hours teaching conflict mediation instead of violence. We must focus our response to the terrorist attacks on 'diplomatic, intelligence and law enforcement aspects of American policy,' as you recommend, and tone down rhetoric that aggravates anti-American hostility and serves to draw the United States into the war between the West and the Muslim world that Osama bin Laden seems to have orchestrated so methodically.","615":"Meanwhile, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell welcomed a speech by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in which he pledged to arm opponents of the de facto Taliban government in Afghanistan, which is believed to be harboring Osama bin Laden.","616":"Others have expressed their opinions, in particular, about Osama bin Laden, whom the Bush administration has described as the primary suspect in the terrorist attack. 'Ben -- You In A Heap of Trouble Boy'; 'RIP Sammy'; 'Osama Been Hiding.'","617":"Among the 27 individuals and organizations on a list attached to the order were three charities that the government believes knowingly or unwittingly channeled money to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network. The groups were Makhtab al-Khidamat, the Wafa Humanitarian Organization and the Al Rashid Trust. [Page B4.]","618":"While saying that Russia was ready to open its airspace to help in search-and-rescue operations, he made no mention in his speech of whether Moscow would provide troops to back any American operation to track down the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden.","619":"There are many types of terrorism and many kinds of terrorist weapons. Even if we succeed in eliminating Osama bin Laden, we have to remember that Timothy McVeigh was home-grown. And as we succeed in battening down the cockpits to prevent civilian aircraft being used again as giant cruise missiles, terrorists will be exploring other vulnerabilities in our open society and investigating even more devastating weapons.","62":"Mr. Odeh has been described by the government as an ardent follower of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, whom the authorities suspect of organizing the attacks as part a broad terrorism conspiracy. Mr. bin Laden is a fugitive, believed to be under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban in Afghanistan.","620":"The president of Egypt and the deputy prime minister of Italy have both said that they were aware of a threat from Osama bin Laden's network of Islamic terrorists to kill President Bush and other leaders of the industrialized world when they met at a summit meeting in Genoa in July. B1","621":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 25\u2014 The president of Egypt and the deputy prime minister of Italy say that Osama bin Laden's network of Islamic terrorists threatened to kill President Bush and other leaders of the industrialized world when they met at a summit meeting in Genoa last July.","622":"Many Palestinians argue that, unlike Osama bin Laden, their fight is not with West, but with Israel.","623":"As Pakistan sparred over Afghanistan's future, officials disclosed that Pakistan's military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate or ISI, had been asked by the United States to send officials, who remain in Afghanistan as intermediaries, back to the Taliban with the demand that Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist associates be handed over.","624":"In its effort to track down Osama bin Laden and other suspects given safe harbor in Afghanistan, the United States has urged all countries to isolate the Taliban.","625":"Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, the foreign minister of the rebel coalition known as the Northern Alliance, remembers that time well. He served as a doctor with the anti-Soviet resistance. But in the latest turn of history, Russia, along with the United States, has become an ally in confronting the Islamic militant Taliban government and the terror suspect it harbors, Osama bin Laden. 'There should be air attacks by Americans, and rocket attacks by us, followed by advances by our ground forces,' Dr. Abdullah said. 'Only by forcing the Taliban into smaller areas, where they can be targeted, will bombing be effective.'","626":"Muhammad Zahir Shah is the former king of Afghanistan. In rapid succession since Sept. 11, envoys from the United States, Italy, the European Parliament and the United Nations have sought out the 86-year-old king to discuss the future of his former land, now the sanctuary of Osama bin Laden, Washington's prime suspect in the attacks.","627":"WESTPORT, Conn.\u2014 President Bush has just stepped up efforts against the international financial network that provides the lifeblood for Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist organization. He is setting up an interagency Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center and has signed an executive order to cut off terrorists and their supporters from the United States economy. These are good first steps, but much more will have to be done.","628":"KHWAJA BAHOUDDIN, Afghanistan, Sept. 25\u2014 They were sophisticated, methodical and relentless. For more than a month, two men believed to be linked to Osama bin Laden duped officials of the rebel Northern Alliance into believing they were journalists.","629":"Today, officials would not identify any people in custody who got or applied for hazardous materials driver's licenses, nor would they detail how these men might be linked to Osama bin Laden nor why they had first come to the attention of authorities in the hijacking investigation.","63":"LEBANON: 29 ON TRIAL -- A military court began the trial of 29 people who are accused of planning attacks on American and Israeli targets in Jordan on the orders of Osama bin Laden. The trial in Beirut coincides with one of 28 suspects in Jordan on similar charges. The nationalities of the 29 men, 18 of whom are at large, were given as Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian. (Reuters)","630":"American experts now aiding the Bush administration's effort to muster an international coalition against terrorism and the Taliban protectors of Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, say that enormous quantities of opium and of heroin itself have been hidden around the country, and have continued to be sold since the ban.","631":"Among the blacklisted 27 are 12 individuals, including Osama bin Laden; 11 groups, including Al Qaeda; 1 corporation and 3 charities.","632":"No one argues that if the United States has solid evidence against Osama bin Laden, they should not hunt him down. But the recent history of American involvement in the region sways the public away from supporting Washington.","633":"For instance, experts said, what can be done online to track a group of criminals depends in part on what those criminals have done online. The organization led by Osama bin Laden, whom President Bush has called the prime suspect in the attacks, is known not to trust high technology for important messages, relying on face-to-face communication instead.","634":"One low the W.W.F. will not plumb is an Osama bin Laden character.","635":"Osama bin Laden, Ms. Miller says, has been experimenting with lethal toxins, and satellites have picked up pictures of little dead animals around his camp. 'Bunnies, dogs,' she murmured. 'This guy is relentless.'","637":"The administration, which has been critical of 'nation building' missions for the United States military, appeared to be trying to walk a fine line between increasing pressure on the Taliban, who have given refuge to Osama bin Laden, the accused terrorist, and finding itself enmeshed in an eventual attempt to rebuild the ruined state of Afghanistan under a new government.","638":"Why has it taken thousands of lives and the horrific devastation of our country's financial and defense centers for the United States government finally to decide on sweeping measures to freeze the assets of Osama bin Laden and other known terrorists?","639":"That makes them perfectly suited to the war the United States is now preparing to wage. If men like Osama bin Laden are hiding in remote caves or underground bunkers, military experts say, no one is more likely to overpower them than the commandos of Delta Force.","64":"Both intentions present problems for the United States, which keeps Sudan on its list of nations supporting international terrorism because, the Clinton administration says, the Sudanese government maintains links with Osama bin Laden, a financier of Islamic militancy.","640":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 25\u2014 Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, met senior Iranian leaders today in Tehran on what he termed a historic visit, part of a flurry of diplomacy aimed at gaining cooperation from Iran as the United States musters a coalition against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan.","642":"HAMBURG, Germany, Sept. 25\u2014 German police are investigating financial ties between two hijackers who rammed airplanes into the World Trade Center towers and a Syrian businessman here who controls a Hamburg bank account belonging to a founder of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.","643":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following questions in their journals (written on the board prior to class): \u201cWhere do you get your news? Do you think your sources are reliable? Why or why not?\u201d Students then share their responses. What different types of news sources can students name? How are these sources similar and different? 2. As a class, read and discuss \u201cSaudi Arabia Cuts Ties with Taliban,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. What did Saudi Arabia announce on September 25, 2001? b. According to the Saudi source, why had the Afghan people earned their country \u201ca special status,\u201d and what does this mean? c. How did the Taliban work against that status, according to the source reported in this article? d. Who is Osama bin Laden, according to the article? e. What might be some consequences of the Saudi Arabian government\u2019s decision? f. Which holy sites are mentioned in the article, and where are they located? g. What was the government of Pakistan\u2019s position on the Taliban, according to the article? h. What roles might the Pakistani military forces play in relation to the proposed American military strikes on Afghanistan, according to this report? i. What types of future military action might the United States have planned, according to the article? j. Who is Mullah Muhammad Omar? k. What is Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar\u2019s official response to the planned military strikes, and how was this message conveyed? l. Where do officials believe Osama bin Laden to be, and why? m. What is the Taliban embassy\u2019s official position on United States military action, according to the article? n. How are the people of Afghanistan responding to planned military strikes on their country, and why? 3. It is strongly suggested that you engage students in a discussion of the historical and political contexts of the Taliban regime and its relationship with the United States and other countries before starting the main activity (see Background section above). You may wish to create a timeline on the board starting with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and ending with the current crisis. Divide students into small groups, and give each group three articles, each from a news source from a different country, all published on the same day and focusing on the Taliban. Sources may include, but are not limited to, American, continental European, Middle Eastern (Arab and Israeli), and Latin American sources. Groups should read the articles (either aloud as a group or individually, rotating the articles among them until all articles are read), and then respond to the following questions (one student in the group should act as the \u201csecretary\u201d; questions written on the board for easier student access): \u201cConsider all of the articles read in class today to answer these questions: \u2013Look at the headlines of the articles. What can you tell about the articles from their headlines? \u2013Which articles contain photographs? What do they depict? What emotions do you think they are supposed to evoke? \u2013How are the articles similar in their accounts of the subject or event? \u2013How are the articles different? \u2013What information do some articles provide that others do not? Why do you think that is? \u2013What information do some articles omit that others include? Why do you that is?\u201d Allow students the opportunity to discuss their findings, either at the end of class or in a future class. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Ask students to watch at least one international news report on television this evening, jotting down notes about how these news reports explore the issues discussed in the articles read in class. Then, each student writes a brief (one to two page) thoughtful evaluation of the information presented, comparing and contrasting print and television news reports of the same topic. Students should be sure to watch with same critical perspective from which they read their print news reports.","644":"SEATTLE, Sept. 26\u2014 Nearly forgotten until Sept. 11, an Algerian-born operative for Osama bin Laden's network was sitting in a federal detention center just south of here, awaiting sentencing for his role in a plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport during the 2000 millennial celebrations.","645":"Mr. Bush has begun suggesting that the Taliban should be overthrown. But engineering the ouster of the Taliban, which have let Osama bin Laden hide out in Afghanistan for years, could engulf Afghanistan in civil war, aggravate a growing refugee crisis on Afghanistan's borders and even destabilize Pakistan. Any of these developments would embolden terrorists and undercut American interests.","646":"Thousands of protesters turned a Taliban march to the abandoned American embassy into a frenzied attack, chanting Osama bin Laden's name and waving white flags of Islam as they burned the compound. B3","647":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26\u2014 Disrupting the finances of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and others will require a global crackdown, including an end to laws in tax haven countries that allow secret bank accounts, the Senate Banking Committee was told today.","648":"Somehow, a New York that suffers terminally from irony deficiency anemia is a bit hard to imagine. A brief glimpse of Jay Leno telling an Osama bin Laden joke on the tube early yesterday suggests that not all of us have lost the American talent for laughing our way through horror.","649":"The Defense Department rushed long-range B-1 and B-52 bombers to the region almost at once. But they have no obvious targets. Bombing Kabul might only create more refugees, who would most likely pour into Pakistan, potentially destabilizing a country on whom the United States is heavily dependent for intelligence on the whereabouts of the terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden. Bombing in the ruggedly mountainous countryside is problematical.","65":"American tourists were to have been singled out in those attacks, prosecutors contend. The defendants are said to have been enlisted and trained by associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Muslim militant now based in Afghanistan, who is accused of responsibility for the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","650":"MADRID, Sept. 26\u2014 Spanish authorities said today that they had arrested six men from an Islamic terrorist cell connected to Osama bin Laden who are suspected of assisting militants planning suicide attacks against American targets in Europe.","651":"At a meeting of NATO defense ministers that offered the administration a first opportunity to convey detailed plans to the alliance, some European states pressed for, but did not get, a detailed showing of evidence that would justify any attack on Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan.","652":"Our goal should not be to eliminate Osama bin Laden but rather to eliminate all terrorism. We should focus on all countries that advocate terrorism or harbor and support terrorists. They should either abandon their ways or be ostracized, and we should not be allied with them.","653":"In the Persian Gulf, it was Desert Storm following Desert Shield. Operation Infinite Reach never reached its target in the 1998 attack on Osama bin Laden. And the networks jump in with 'America's New War' or the like accompanied by theme music and colorful graphics.","654":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26\u2014 A public accounting of the evidence against Osama bin Laden and his allies has been delayed indefinitely by an internal struggle over declassifying secret information, government officials said today.","655":"As the inquiry proceeded, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said investigators had learned that Osama bin Laden's finances were seriously hurt when regulators shut down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International 10 years ago. The bank was closed amid a vast scandal, having been connected to fraud, theft, secret weapons deals, money laundering and terrorist financing.","656":"The ayatollah's statement contrasted with more temperate language from Iranian leaders in recent days that raised hopes in Washington that Tehran might be willing to cooperate with the coalition that the United States is trying to build against the terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, who have harbored him.","657":"On top of a panicky rush to eliminate rights, too many of us are afflicted with a 'nameless, unreasoning and unjustified terror,' in F.D.R.'s words, of seeming to be complacent about the terrorist threat. This catch-up alarmism contributes to the 'terrorist mastermind' theory that focuses on Osama bin Laden as the central villain. It is simpler and less controversial than exposing the far greater nuclear and bio-war threat based in states using terrorists as their launch pads.","658":"Such a move would first require an act of war by Congress. Even if the Sept. 11 attack cannot be positively traced to Osama bin Laden, his call for death to Americans makes him a sufficiently credible threat to justify war against him and his host country.","659":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 26\u2014 Thousands of Afghan protesters turned a Taliban march to the abandoned American Embassy in Kabul into a frenzied attack today, chanting Osama bin Laden's name and waving white flags of Islam as they torched the compound, burned American flags and hacked at the mothballed chancery building with an ax.","66":"Haqqania is notable not only because of its size, but also because it has graduated more leaders of the Taliban, Afghanistan's ruling faction, than any other school in the world, including any school in Afghanistan. The Taliban is today known the world over for its harsh interpretation of Islamic law, its cruelty to women and its kindness to terrorists -- the most notable one being Osama bin Laden, the 42-year-old Saudi exile who the American government believes was behind the bombings two years ago of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Taliban also seems to harbor a deep belief in the notion of a never-ending jihad, which makes the Haqqania madrasa a focus of intense interest in such capitals as Washington and Moscow and New Delhi and Jerusalem, where the experts are trying to understand just what it is the Taliban and its sympathizers want.","660":"Since the terror attacks on America on Sept. 11 and the resulting American threats to attack the Taliban for harboring the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden, Pakistan has closed its borders to more refugees from Afghanistan. Many here still worry about an influx of tens of thousands more, while at the same time fretting about the fate of relatives across the frontier.","661":"With Washington urging countries around the world to join in a coalition against terrorism, warnings like these are being sounded across the Middle East, where leaders have waged their own battles against Islamic extremism since long before Osama bin Laden became a household word, but have also had to address the danger that crackdowns can fuel a further fervor.","662":"The apparent scams include door-to-door magazine salesmen asserting the proceeds of their sales will go to victims in New York and telemarketers saying they are collecting money to hunt down Osama bin Laden.","663":"The crisis appeared to be giving some pause to Bush administration officials considering military strikes against targets associated with Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and the ruling Taliban government in Afghanistan. In several public statements senior officials have taken note of the palpable fear that American military operations might lead to the deaths of more Afghan civilians than the number of people killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.","664":"Mr. Cohen, graying ponytail and all, has burst, Kunstler-like, into the news as the most visible lawyer for Muslim Americans. He is playing the role with the verve of the Old Left lawyers of the 1960's. In interviews and television appearances where he discusses two Muslim clients who have been questioned by investigators, he is provocative. He says he will not rule out representing Osama bin Laden himself. Mr. Cohen calls the current investigation a witch hunt.","665":"Two of the prisoners here, the more educated and the seemingly more determined, who say they have been interviewed scores of times, claim to have been schooled in hijacking and bomb-making at the training camps of Osama bin Laden, the wanted terrorist.","666":"MESSAGE TO BIN LADEN -- The Taliban said a courier had delivered their request to Osama bin Laden to leave Afghanistan. Pakistan is sending a delegation to Kandahar today to press for the Taliban to hand him over. A1","667":"Since declarations by American leaders that this month's terrorist attacks were probably planned by Osama bin Laden, some customers have urged Mr. Mustafa to change his restaurant's name. He seems uncertain how to respond.","668":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 27\u2014 The Rev. Jesse Jackson said today that he might try to meet with Afghanistan's Taliban rulers in an effort to persuade them to hand over Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist associates.","669":"The conversation among the four uniformed patrolmen on the Brooklyn side of the Manhattan Bridge caught the relative gracefulness of yesterday's morning commute. They talked about Roger Clemens, Michael Jordan and Osama bin Laden. There was hardly a word about Hondas, Fords or Chevrolets.","67":"At a Pakistani religious school, Osama bin Laden is a hero, famous alumni include members of the Taliban and a new generation is being militantly groomed. MAGAZINE","670":"Like other rebel officials, he noted that the alliance had been warning other countries about Osama bin Laden for years. 'All the time, General Massoud told the world,' the general said. 'No one listened.'","671":"Publicly, Mr. Clinton has defended his own administration's efforts to capture Osama bin Laden, and he has called for the country to rally behind President Bush.","672":"Mr. Gelbard said last week that Osama bin Laden, who is Washington's prime suspect in this month's attacks, could also be tied to threats that caused the closure of the embassy here for several days last fall.","673":"As for the new strategy, if our first priority is to destroy the Osama bin Laden network in Afghanistan, then we need to understand that it takes a home-grown network to destroy a home-grown network. Let me put it another way: If Osama bin Laden were hiding in the jungles of Colombia instead of Afghanistan, whose help would we enlist to find him? U.S. Army Special Forces? The Colombian Army? I don't think so.","674":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 27\u2014 Efforts to get Osama bin Laden to leave Afghanistan appeared to move forward today, with Afghanistan's ruling Taliban announcing that a courier had delivered their request to him to leave and with Pakistan still hoping to get Afghan leaders to expel their guest.","675":"The letter became public the same day the F.B.I released photographs of the hijackers and the bureau's director, Robert S. Mueller III said 'one or more of them do have contacts with Al Qaeda,' the terrorist network linked to Osama bin Laden that is based in Afghanistan.","676":"Some Islamic scholars here question whether anyone at all will end up going to Afghanistan. Al Chaidar, a researcher at the University of Indonesia and a member of a militant Islamic group, said thousands of Indonesians did join the war against Russia in Afghanistan a decade ago. He said some groups here were in contact with the organization of Osama bin Laden, cited by the United States for the attacks this month.","677":"Mr. O'Neill was raised in Ventnor, N.J., and joined the F.B.I. in 1970 after graduating from high school. In 1993, he began investigating the trade center bombing and went on to became the agency's resident expert on Osama bin Laden by leading the investigation into the attacks on the destroyer Cole and the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.","678":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 28\u2014 President Bush said today that the United States was 'in hot pursuit' of both Osama bin Laden and the Taliban forces harboring him in Afghanistan.","679":"An attack against Osama bin Laden's forces in Afghanistan, or a successful effort to overthrow the Taliban government, would produce little open dissent among NATO and European Union countries, the officials say. But they say that even those actions, if they were to produce more than a few hundred civilian casualties, could create significant strains in the alliance.","68":"PARIS, June 27\u2014 The police here have detained an accused terrorist who is linked to the network of Osama bin Laden and to an Islamic fundamentalist cell in Canada that plotted to bomb American buildings, an investigator said.","680":"There's the rub. Do we really have good evidence linking Osama bin Laden to the Sept. 11 attacks? If we do, how do we attack him? President Clinton had cruise missiles strike a camp where he was -- and missed him by an hour. If anything, he will be harder to locate and hit now. Americans may have to develop a tolerance for failure.","681":"The administration's largesse toward Pakistan is another sign of how Washington is rewarding Arab and Muslim states that back its antiterror campaign -- in various degrees and with various degrees of risk to their stability -- against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government in Afghanistan.","683":"Intelligence officials suspect that Osama bin Laden, the fugitive terrorist, may be hiding in this kind of maze somewhere across the border in Afghanistan. But the underground labyrinth here is a sanctuary of a different sort.","684":"The Russian experience also begs the question of whether a counterterrorist force would seek, as the Russian Army did, to tame an entire nation. American strategists have indicated that their objectives -- chief among them capturing Osama bin Laden and fellow terrorists, and punishing the Taliban -- would be far more limited.","685":"The prime suspect in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Osama bin Laden, was reported to have lived in Khartoum from 1991 to 1996. Under pressure from the United States and Saudi Arabia, Sudan expelled him, and he settled in Afghanistan, where the Taliban provided him a haven.","686":"Rudy Giuliani is being mercurial again. Nostradamus is falling off the best-seller list. CNN's ratings have dropped 70 percent from their post-attack peak. Jay Leno delivers a joke linking Osama bin Laden to Anna Nicole Smith. (Had it been funny, I'd repeat it.) Scattered among the bulletins of widespread layoffs are austere TV commercials in slo-mo black-and-white in which corporations pledge their solidarity with the American spirit.","687":"'HOT PURSUIT' -- President Bush said the United States was 'in hot pursuit' of both Osama bin Laden and the Taliban forces harboring him in Afghanistan. American officials would not say whether intelligence operatives or commando units were in Afghanistan in recent days. A1","688":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 28\u2014 A last-ditch effort by Pakistan to persuade Afghanistan's ruling Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden failed today when a group of militant Islamic clerics flew back to Pakistan and reported that the Taliban's leader had dismissed any possibility of a handover.","689":"HAMBURG, Germany, Sept. 28\u2014 In the hours following the Sept. 11 terror attacks, German intelligence agents intercepted a phone conversation between jubilant followers of Osama bin Laden that led the F.B.I. to search frantically for two more teams of suicide hijackers, according to officials in both countries.","69":"The French police detained a terror suspect linked to the network of Osama bin Laden and to an Islamic fundamentalist cell in Canada that plotted to bomb American targets. A4","690":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 28\u2014 The Bush administration is putting aside the American military's longstanding insistence on using overwhelming force to vanquish its enemy. Instead, Pentagon planners are now focusing on commando raids and limited air strikes to root out Osama bin Laden's terrorist network in Afghanistan.","691":"The myths and realities of Osama bin Laden swirl together like the smoke over the ruins of the World Trade Center and its thousands of dead. Who is this man?","692":"It was three more years before Mr. Mohamed got his call. Four months after that, he helped bomb the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania, one of two attacks in East Africa that day that killed 224 people and were attributed squarely to Al Qaeda and its founder, Osama bin Laden.","693":"Once the president tardily re-emerged, he had no choice but to play catch-up and transform himself A.S.A.P. from absent father to Superdad, circa 2001. You had to feel for him. As those of us in his boomer generation know -- especially those of us who have raised teenagers -- it's no longer easy for a father to lay down the law (if it ever was). George W. Bush had to do exactly that with Osama bin Laden, but with his fellow citizens he had to be more Oprahfied -- or, as we might say now, more Rudied. Bush struggled mightily at first to find the balance. And so arrived this very strange sentence delivered to the nation from the Oval Office: 'I'm a loving guy, and I am also someone, however, who's got a job to do.' In other words, he was at once a dad who hugs the kids -- as he would subsequently instruct the nation to do in his take-charge address to Congress -- and Gary Cooper at high noon. Then he welled up with tears -- as Dan Rather would, to overflowing, in his comparable updating of the anchor's paternal persona on the Letterman show a few days later.","694":"In every direction in this city of 12 million people, the largest city in a nation that has become a crucial but brittle ally in the United States' war on terrorism, there are cries and signs for Osama bin Laden, for the Taliban, for holy war.","695":"The Bush administration has resisted temptation to retaliate immediately for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as it rallies broader international support for battling terrorism and gleans intelligence on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and his allies.","697":"At a New York University class on press ethics, Todd Gitlin, a professor of culture, journalism and sociology, talked about the Pentagon Papers, and asked students whether they would publish classified evidence against Osama bin Laden. His colleague Robby Cohen, a social studies professor, predicted a rise in Middle Eastern studies, recalling that Daniel Ellsberg, who made the Pentagon Papers public, doubted that anyone in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson could pass a freshman course in Vietnamese culture and politics.","698":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 29\u2014 The Central Intelligence Agency secretly began to send teams of American officers to northern Afghanistan about three years ago in an attempt to persuade the leader of the anti-Taliban Afghan opposition to capture and perhaps kill Osama bin Laden, according to American intelligence officials.","699":"For now, diplomats say, the United States appears well on the way to winning what may be most urgent: the support of neighboring countries like Pakistan and Uzbekistan for military operations in Afghanistan, a safe haven for Osama bin Laden.","7":"A federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that the highly restrictive jail conditions placed on one of the defendants in the investigation of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the embassy bombings in Africa in 1998, were not a violation of the inmate's rights.","70":"Prosecutors have said that Mr. Odeh, who has pleaded not guilty, made statements to the authorities accepting responsibility for the attacks, admitting that he gave technical advice and other assistance to the bombers in Tanzania, and saying he was a member of a group led by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the authorities suspect of masterminding the attacks and other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.","700":"But when George W. Bush ad-libbed that 'this crusade, this war on terrorism, is going to take a while,' his figure of speech was widely criticized. That's because the word has a religious root, meaning 'taking the cross,' and was coined in the 11th century to describe the first military expedition of the Crusaders, European Christians sent to recover the Holy Land from the followers of Muhammad. The rallying-cry noun is offensive to many Muslims: three years ago, Osama bin Laden maligned U.S. forces in the Middle East as 'crusader armies spreading like locusts.'","701":"With evidence that Muslim militants were responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, prominent Islamic scholars and theologians in the West say unequivocally that nothing in Islam countenances the Sept. 11 actions. But in interviews, they explained that certain scriptural passages are distorted by Islamic extremists like Osama bin Laden.","702":"His position is clear: the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were acts of terrorism, but before the United States can claim the right to retaliate against Osama bin Laden or the Taliban, it must prove they were responsible. Without such proof, Sattar Shah says that his group, which is the student wing of a leading religious party, will have little choice but to embark on a holy war. 'We will do it, as we did it against the Russians,' he says.","704":"Many Americans see Osama bin Laden as a mass murderer. To millions around the globe, he is beloved, partly for hating America. PAGE B5","705":"Most expressed support for retaliatory strikes against Osama bin Laden, who, they were quick to note, is from Saudi Arabia. But their thoughts were also with friends and family in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan.","706":"COVERT TRIPS TO AFGHANISTAN -- The Central Intelligence Agency secretly sent teams of American officers to northern Afghanistan, starting about three years ago, to try to persuade a leading opponent of the country's Taliban government to capture and perhaps kill Osama bin Laden, American intelligence officials say. The efforts to reach that leader, Ahmed Shah Massoud, were among the most classified elements of a campaign continuing through this year. A1","708":"Cardinal Camillo Ruini, head of the Italian Bishops Conference, for example, issued a statement this week reminding Europe of the debt it owed to the United States, while Cardinal Carlo Martini, the archbishop of Milan, continued to talk about the need to make sure Osama bin Laden was guilty in the attacks on New York and Washington.","709":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 29\u2014 In the first days after the terror attacks on New York and Washington, Saudi Arabia supervised the urgent evacuation of 24 members of Osama bin Laden's extended family from the United States, fearing that they might be subjected to violence.","71":"Mr. Haouari's waiver closely follows an arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on June 26 of Mohamed Zeki Mahjoub, who, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service says, is a terrorist leader closely allied with Osama bin Laden.","710":"John Corigliano's equating of the followers of Osama bin Laden with the followers of Hitler with the followers of Arnold Schoenberg was upsetting but ultimately revealing ['We Are All AIDS Sufferers,' Sept. 23]. Those musical turf wars are over, Mr. Corigliano. And you've won. How you now treat those with whom you disagree artistically will determine your legacy. Will you enforce a new dogma by demonizing your opponents and supporting only those with whom you agree? Or are you willing to support a pluralism that is not simply an exchange of dominances but works to make a place for everyone?","711":"In recent days, Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi of Pakistan has also needed to spend time on the telephone with a Pakistani woman in Dallas whose husband was gunned down, possibly in a hate crime. The killing would be especially perverse since, of all Muslim nations, Pakistan is emerging as the key ally in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and it has pledged its airspace and intelligence support in tracking him down.","712":"Those officials also identified several Pakistani air bases near the 1,400-mile border with Afghanistan that have been earmarked for use in American military operations against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government of Afghanistan.","713":"It was the only truly political moment in a show that started with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani offering a serious, forward-looking tribute to New York, and went on to do safe satires of pop culture. But it was a sign of the toe-in-the-water approach to topical humor that comedy shows are taking. Last week Jay Leno started telling Osama bin Laden jokes, based on the 'Springtime for Hitler' model that says it's O.K. to make fun of the bad guy. They weren't funny jokes, but he's so rarely funny that's not surprising.","714":"Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, which the Bush administration believes were planned by Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, the king has come to believe he has no choice, his son said. 'His presence is really necessary there, people are waiting for him, and I'm sure he's going,' he said.","715":"The aid workers -- two Americans, two Australians and four Germans -- who worked for the German-run aid organization Shelter Now appeared in open court for the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The Taliban, who rule Afghanistan, stand accused of harboring the man whom the United States considers the main suspect, Osama bin Laden.","716":"Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, who have made various conflicting statements about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, now say they know where he is. PAGE B3","717":"The laughter, however, retains a sardonic edge. The final article on The Onion's Web page describes former president George Bush's apology to President George W. Bush for having financed Osama bin Laden and the Afghan fighters against Soviet forces.","718":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 30\u2014 Osama bin Laden is still in Afghanistan 'under the control' of the Taliban government at a hideout known only to 'the people responsible for his safety,' the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan said today.","719":"As the Bush administration promotes legislation that would expand its power to place wiretaps on suspected terrorists, it faces a troubling obstacle: few of its intelligence agents are fluent in Arabic, the native language of Osama bin Laden. Even fewer understand Farsi or Pashto, the most common languages in Afghanistan.","72":"Last October, the United Nations Security Council, led by Russia and the United States, passed a resolution demanding that the Taliban stop providing refuge to terrorists and that they expel Osama bin Laden so that he could stand trial on terrorism charges stemming from his alleged planning of the bomb attacks that destroyed two American embassies in Africa in 1998.","720":"The administration's program of covert support for anti-Taliban groups has emerged as a key element of its plan to oust a regime that Washington has accused of sheltering Osama bin Laden and his network.","721":"The administration's program of covert support for anti-Taliban groups has emerged as a key element of its plan to oust a regime that Washington has accused of sheltering Osama bin Laden and his network.","722":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 30\u2014 The military is concerned about a shortage of surveillance equipment as the pursuit of Osama bin Laden is heating up, senior Pentagon officials and congressional aides said in interviews in the last few days.","723":"FREEZING TERRORIST ASSETS -- Bush administration officials are preparing to freeze the assets of about two dozen more charities and other organizations that are suspected of providing money and support to Osama bin Laden's terrorist operations, government officials said. A1","724":"LONDON, Sept. 30\u2014 Prime Minister Tony Blair, apparently seeking to bolster the United States-led coalition against terrorism, said today that he had seen 'incontrovertible evidence' linking Osama bin Laden to the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11.","725":"He said his government had no first-hand knowledge about Osama bin Laden, who has been under the protection of the Taliban, or the involvement of his group in the Sept. 11 attacks. 'These terrorists succeeded because of secrecy, and we don't have the best of relations with the Taliban,' he said.","726":"'People call and say, 'Send that one out to Osama bin Laden,' ' said Marilynn Mee, the program director of WLZR. 'We tell them, 'Bin Laden's not going to hear this,' and they say, 'Send it out anyway.' '","727":"Widening the financial assault on Osama bin Laden, administration officials are preparing to freeze the assets of about two dozen more charities and other organizations that are suspected of providing money and support to his terrorist operations, government officials said yesterday.","728":"There is widespread revulsion for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and for the methods of the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden. The feelings for Palestinians, however, are at least as strong.","729":"Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian, was extradited on Sunday from the United Arab Emirates in connection with a plot to attack American interests in Europe. The French police have linked him to Osama bin Laden, who is believed to have masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.","73":"Israeli and Palestinian security officials have arrested 23 Arabs suspected of planning a series of terror attacks to disrupt peace efforts, and said at least one suspect had links to Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist suspect. Security officials said the arrests, over three months, involved radicals with links to the Hamas and Islamic Holy War groups in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as the Al-Qaeda movement led by Mr. bin Laden.","730":"BIN LADEN CALLED MOTHER -- A foreign official said Osama bin Laden called his mother in Syria the day before the Sept. 11 attacks to tell her he could not meet her there because 'something big' was imminent. B5","731":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 1\u2014 The Bush administration today released a list of 19 countries that have agreed to freeze the assets of Osama bin Laden and his associates. But the relatively short list of countries that had agreed to cooperate completely with the United States request showed how difficult it is to bar suspected terrorists from using the international financial system.","732":"Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's semiapology for his disparaging remarks about Islamic civilization has apparently not satisfied his critics, especially in Arab countries. Today he will meet with the Saudi ambassador, the head of the Islamic Cultural Center in Rome and other Arab officials. The Arab League secretary general, Amr Mussa, said he had met with the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, on how to respond to what he called unacceptable accusations against Islamic culture. In a speech before the Italian Senate on Friday, Mr. Berlusconi expressed regret if his words last week had hurt Arab sensitivities. Gavino Angius, the senate leader of the opposition Democrats of the Left party, said Mr. Berlusconi's words had been stupid, had isolated Italy and were a gift to Osama bin Laden. Marina Harss (NYT)","733":"While there are no signs of a rift between Mr. Bush and Mr. O'Neill, the president has, contrary to his last few predecessors, dispersed responsibility for economic policy broadly. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush gave Mr. O'Neill the high-profile duty of tracking down the financial assets of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network.","734":"Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about the possibility that the United States was using Special Forces and intelligence operatives to track down Osama bin Laden and the Taliban forces harboring him in Afghanistan misstated the name of a British force that some officials said might be involved in the search. It is the Special Air Service, not the Strategic Air Service.","735":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 1\u2014 Osama bin Laden telephoned his mother in Syria the day before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to tell her that he could not meet her there because 'something big' was imminent that would end their communications for a long time, a senior foreign official said tonight.","736":"This new antiterrorist alliance will surely be strengthened by the confrontation with the Taliban, who have made Afghanistan a training ground and safe haven for anti-Russian, anti-Chinese and anti-Indian terrorists, as well as for Osama bin Laden's network. European governments also are ready to do their part by investigating Islamist circles that have long aroused the concern of their police and security services.","737":"American intervention in the Middle East conflict, which President Bush sought to play down in his first eight months in the White House, has assumed much broader importance as the administration tries to enlist Arab backing in forcing Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to end their support of Osama bin Laden. Many moderate Arab states have made clear that a serious American engagement in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a condition for their support of the administration's drive to crush terrorism.","738":"The Afghan opposition forces that the United States is supporting in its campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban governors who are sheltering him include a deposed octogenarian king in exile in Rome and the Northern Alliance's jostling collection of tribal leaders, self-styled warlords and boys like Lalsaid.","739":"This country, then, may seem a strange choice as America's indispensable ally in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Islamic guerrillas -- many would call them terrorists -- openly operate inside Pakistan's borders, with government support.","74":"WEST BANK: BIN LADEN LINK DENIED -- The leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas denied an assertion by Israel that a Hamas member who was among 23 Arabs arrested on terrorism charges had been sent to Pakistan for terrorist training with the group headed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant. 'Hamas and I have no connection with bin Laden,' Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated Press. John F. Burns (NYT)","740":"There is widespread revulsion for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and for the methods of the prime suspect, Osama bin Laden. The feelings for Palestinians, however, are at least as strong.","741":"Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian, was extradited on Sunday from the United Arab Emirates in connection with a plot to attack American interests in Europe. The French police have linked him to Osama bin Laden, who is believed to have masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.","742":"BIN LADEN CALLED MOTHER -- A foreign official said Osama bin Laden called his mother in Syria the day before the Sept. 11 attacks to tell her he could not meet her there because 'something big' was imminent.

'A very cunning man; if we try to demonize him, we're going to lose.' And the World Trade Center? An expert witness and consultant after the 1993 trade center bombing, the downing of Pan Am 103, and the United States Embassy bombings in East Africa, he yanks a book from the admonitory stack he's written in the last decade.","744":"The council would be ready to step in if the Taliban is forced out, they said. Both the former king and the opposition commanders made clear that they believe that their plan is a way not just to rid their country of the Taliban, but to avoid American reprisals against Afghanistan, where the terror suspect Osama bin Laden is under Taliban protection.","745":"Last week, Mr. Bush issued an executive order freezing the assets of people and organizations said to be linked to the Islamic militant Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the terrorist attacks.","746":"Months ago, Dale F. Eickelman, a professor at Dartmouth College, accepted a grant from a program at Oxford University to study the splintering religious and political leadership within the Islamic world, including the role of Osama bin Laden.","747":"These missions should emphasize our determination to track down Osama bin Laden and to destroy his organization and other terrorist groups; ask for the countries' cooperation in the war on terrorism; offer economic cooperation if these countries join the war on terrorism; and make clear that the United States will regard any regime that aids or harbors terrorists to be an enemy and that we will wage war against that regime with all of our military might.","748":"Secretary Powell insisted that the administration is demonstrating to allies and moderate Arab governments that the case against Osama bin Laden and his network is convincing.","749":"Mr. Farhadi, Afghanistan's only representative at the United Nations, speaks for the sliver of land still unconquered by the Taliban, the radical Muslim group believed to be sheltering Osama bin Laden. Mr. Farhadi's government, known as the Northern Alliance, holds only about 10 percent of the country, a barren corner in the northeast where it has been dreaming of a comeback.","750":"BRIGHTON, England, Oct. 2\u2014 Sealing his standing as America's most passionate and steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism, Prime Minister Tony Blair declared today that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and challenged the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan to give him up or 'face the consequences.'","751":"In Washington today, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, speaking after talks with India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said the American campaign against terrorism would focus on Kashmiri militants as well as Al Qaeda, the network of Osama bin Laden, the primary suspect in the attacks. 'We are going after terrorism in a comprehensive way, not just in the present instance of Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, but terrorism as it affects nations around the world, to include the kind of terrorism that affects India,' Secretary Powell said.","752":"BRUSSELS, Oct. 2\u2014 NATO said today that the United States had provided 'clear and compelling proof' that Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization was behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In response, the alliance said it was ready to fight at the side of the United States should it ask for such help from its 18 NATO allies.","753":"NATO UNITY -- The alliance, finding Washington had 'clear and compelling proof' that Osama bin Laden was behind the Sept. 11 attacks, invoked its mutual defense clause. A1","754":"This course of action would play into the hands of militant terrorists like Osama bin Laden. Countries like Iran may serve vital interests of the United Nations and United States to a far greater degree by making it clear to Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan and elsewhere that being anti-Taliban and anti-bin Laden is not tantamount to being pro-United States. Such a message could help stem unrest in the Pakistan region, which is in urgent need of more moderate pro-Islamic voices.","755":"Should the opposition gain sufficient ground to topple the government, Osama bin Laden may no longer have the assurance of safety from his host country.","756":"Officials here believe that the Abu Sayyaf, which has about 300 members, received seed money from groups associated with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks. Mrs. Arroyo noted that 'Abu Sayyaf was established in 1990 or 1991, and that's when those organizations were here.'","757":"Soon after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some military officials suggested that the United States would seek to use Pakistan as a major staging area for air and ground attacks against Osama bin Laden and the radical Islamic Taliban government that shelters him in Afghanistan.","758":"SECRETARY POWELL -- The cables that we sent out really had several pieces to them. One, the history of the organization and the fact that we have every right to go after them because they've already been indicted, Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, for past crimes against the U.S. and against civilization. And we make sure we understand that. . . .","759":"On June 22 the Spanish police arrested Muhammad Bensakhria, an Algerian described as a deputy to Osama bin Laden, who was extradited to France to face conspiracy charges in connection with a reported plot to attack targets in Strasbourg, including the European Parliament. The police suspect a link with Mr. Atta but, Mr. Cotino said, 'we can't prove it.'","76":"Sanctions were imposed on the Taliban largely at the behest of the United States, which wants Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier who lives in Afghanistan and has been accused of financing international terrorism.","760":"QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 2\u2014 Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said tonight that they were ready to negotiate with Washington about turning over Osama bin Laden to a third country, apparently in an effort to avert a military attack by the United States and its allies.","761":"QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 2\u2014 Afghanistan's ruling Taliban said tonight that they were ready to negotiate with Washington about turning over Osama bin Laden to a third country, apparently in an effort to avert a military attack by the United States and its allies.","762":"PARIS, Oct. 2\u2014 A Frenchman of Algerian background has told French investigators that he was part of a plot by Osama bin Laden to blow up the American Embassy in Paris, according to a French official familiar with the testimony.","763":"In 1994, two jetliners were hijacked by people who wanted to crash them into buildings, one of them by an Islamic militant group. And the 2000 edition of the F.A.A.'s annual report on Criminal Acts Against Aviation, published this year, said that although Osama bin Laden 'is not known to have attacked civil aviation, he has both the motivation and the wherewithal to do so,' adding, 'Bin Laden's anti-Western and anti-American attitudes make him and his followers a significant threat to civil aviation, particularly to U.S. civil aviation.'","764":"It is important to demonstrate to the world that America stands for justice in its response to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. By sharing some of its evidence linking Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network Al Qaeda to those attacks with foreign leaders this week, the Bush administration has honored fundamental American values. A portion of this material should be made public as well. Secretary of State Colin Powell was right to promise such a presentation of evidence last month. It would help build stronger international support for the campaign against terrorism.","765":"A senior government official in Pakistan said law enforcement authorities were certain that Osama bin Laden's network used hawala to transfer money to agents outside Afghanistan, along with conventional means. But the nature of hawala will make tracking those particular exchanges almost impossible.","766":"Both Russia and Iran are enemies of the Taliban government in Afghanistan and of Osama bin Laden.","767":"With their oxymoronic holy war, Osama bin Laden and his murderous disciples meant to expose our moral vacuity. But they exposed only their own.","768":"ROLE OF EGYPTIANS -- The Egyptian Islamic Jihad, once pushed into exile, now forms a backbone for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.

Powell took the unusual step of inviting the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to lunch today. His guests emerged satisfied, they said, that the Bush administration would try to alleviate a major concern: that military action against Osama bin Laden would inflame the Muslim world.","771":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 3\u2014 On the first leg of a whirlwind trip through the Middle East and Central Asia, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld sought today to solidify Saudi support for a United States strike against Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and the Bush administration's broader war against terrorism.","772":"Visits to Tottenham and Finsbury Park today left unclear whether any of the groups were linked in any way to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 terror attacks, or whether the British authorities were simply keeping an eye on known groups considered extremist by the mainstream majority of Britain's 1.5 million Muslims.","773":"Taliban leaders demand proof that Osama bin Laden was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks before they will agree to extradite him. There's something about the demand that puzzles me.","774":"Your call for the United States to make public its evidence that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda are connected to, if not mainly responsible for, the Sept. 11 attacks (editorial, Oct. 3) is difficult to understand.","775":"There is full agreement within the Bush administration that its first priority in responding to last month's terror attacks is finding and destroying Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.","776":"Marianne, a political weekly, ran a banner headline last week asking, 'How far do we go in standing with America?' Another magazine divided its front page in half, putting pictures of the 'guilty' -- such as Osama bin Laden -- at the top of the page and the 'responsible' at the bottom. In the magazine's view, the responsible included Mr. Bush, for turning his back on negotiations in the Middle East. In passionate letters to newspapers, readers deplore what they see as America's narrow-minded desire for vengeance.","777":"With that assassination, 20 years ago this week, Egyptian Islamic Jihad announced its existence to the world. Pushed since then largely into exile, its leadership now forms the backbone for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, terrorism experts have said. It is believed to provide him with his two top lieutenants, another 200 loyal followers and its focus on training and specialized skills, notable elements in the Sept. 11 attacks.","778":"Even if there were no such defiant fighters, waging war in that country would be a daunting business. The mountains soar to 20,000 feet in the east, and endless deserts lie in the west. Tracking down Osama bin Laden and finding Al Qaeda base camps in the forbidding recesses of the Hindu Kush will be difficult in the extreme.","779":"Government officials also offered new details today about negotiations several years ago between the United States and Sudan in which the Sudanese government offered to turn over Osama bin Laden, who is reported to be the mastermind of last month's terror attacks.","78":"The Clinton administration added the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to a list of foreign terrorist organizations, saying it had strong ties to the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden.

Terrorists might try to cause a contagion of anthrax or smallpox, Mr. Cohen said.","782":"Secretary of State of State Colin L. Powell asserts that we should not view the case against Osama bin Laden through the prism of courtroom procedure. Though he does not offer a substitute measure, he maintains that the evidence against Mr. bin Laden is 'pretty good information.' Regardless of the forum and regardless of the analytic prism employed, we should insist on much more than 'pretty good information' before killing Mr. bin Laden, his associates and, inevitably, innocent civilians. 'Beyond a reasonable doubt' fits the bill.","783":"PARIS, Oct. 3\u2014 A young Frenchman of Algerian background, extradited here from Britain over the weekend, today was ordered held and placed under formal investigation, becoming the ninth suspect in a case that may link Osama bin Laden with a plot to blow up the United States Embassy in Paris, French officials and newspapers reported.","784":"With the Taliban leaders refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden, named by the United States as the 'prime suspect' in the attacks, many within the Taliban's ranks appear to have concluded that war with the United States is inevitable.","785":"Pakistan's most important contribution may be intelligence. Along with Russia and Egypt, and to a lesser degree China, it is believed to have the best data about Osama bin Laden.","786":"It was unclear last night why in the days after Mr. Al-Angari's arrest, a law enforcement official said privately that he appeared to have ties to a brother of Osama bin Laden, the man President Bush has said is the prime suspect behind the attacks.","787":"Although American and British officials say they have 'no doubt' that Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda terrorist organization were behind the crimes of Sept. 11, so far no actual evidence has been made public. The Bush administration has given secret briefings to leaders of NATO and American allies, but the strongest information the public has of a link between Mr. bin Laden and the terrorists' acts is that Mohammad Atta, one of the hijackers, received $100,000 from a source in Pakistan that apparently cannot be definitely identified.","788":"A federal judge in Manhattan has refused to dismiss charges against or grant a new trial for two men convicted in connection with the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa, which the authorities say were masterminded by Osama bin Laden. The judge, Leonard B. Sand, said Tuesday that there was no merit to arguments by the two defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a Saudi man who helped to deliver the bomb in Nairobi; and Wadih El-Hage, who was convicted of terrorism conspiracy. Two other convicted defendants did not file motions; all four men are to be sentenced this month.

The announcement appeared aimed at winning over the Afghan people even as Mr. Bush tries to undermine the Taliban government and perhaps deal it a military blow for harboring Osama bin Laden.","791":"Instead of contributing to the holy war atmosphere generated by Osama bin Laden and his cohorts, we should urge and assist Muslims everywhere to work with others to combat the terrorist fanaticism we all abhor.","792":"*Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the terrorist network which he heads, planned and carried out the atrocities on 11 September 2001;","793":"On several fronts, the United States and its allies moved closer toward military action in Afghanistan, most clearly by strengthening the case that they have built against Osama bin Laden.","794":"Maureen Dowd (column, Oct. 3) says: 'Osama bin Laden and his murderous disciples meant to expose our moral vacuity. But they exposed only their own.'","795":"The attacks of Sept. 11 confirm the conservative view that the world is not 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.' No one is talking 'conflict resolution' or negotiations with Osama bin Laden. This is no time to argue that conservatism has been disproved. In fact, the need for a vigorous national defense makes people conservative.","796":"EVIDENCE SET FORTH -- In the days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, Osama bin Laden indicated that he was 'about to launch a major attack on America,' according to a British government document accusing Mr. Bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network of 'responsibility for the terrorist atrocities in the United States.'

It remains unclear whether the Algerians had decided to attack a particular target in the United States and, if so, where it was. Nor is it clear whether Mr. Haouari was following the lead of some more internationally known terrorist leader, for instance Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is accused by the United States of masterminding the bombings of American Embassies in Africa in 1998 that left more than 200 dead. Intelligence officials say Mr. bin Laden has operated training camps in Afghanistan.","80":"The Security Council imposed financial and airline sanctions against the Taliban last year after they refused to expel Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born terrorist suspected of organizing the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.","800":"On Tuesday, the United States briefed its allies on its investigation, and NATO agreed that there was 'clear and compelling evidence' that Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization were behind the attacks.","801":"JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 4\u2014 Not everyone in this cosmopolitan port that claims Osama bin Laden as a native son is ready to label him a terrorist just yet.","802":"On Tuesday, the United States briefed its allies on its investigation, and NATO agreed that there was 'clear and compelling evidence' that Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization were behind the attacks.","803":"Like Mr. Rohrabacher, many conservatives and neo-conservatives, including some Democrats, argue that Mr. Bush cannot limit a war on terrorism to Osama bin Laden. In a letter to the president circulated by William Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, several signers, including Jeane J.

These terrorists aren't out for a new kind of coexistence with us. They are out for our non-existence.","809":"Yesterday, for example, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, in a paper that fixed responsibility for last month's terrorist attacks on the network headed by Osama bin Laden, noted that both Mr. bin Laden and the Taliban 'jointly exploited the drugs trade.'","81":"For the Lebanese, Fatima Gate has become a tourist attraction, with buses arriving daily from Beirut and Tyre and Sidon carrying those eager to explore a part of their country that was off limits for a generation.

The guide might focus on one or several of the following issues: charities; helping children cope; media resources; information about Afghanistan, the Taliban and Osama bin Laden; and the concepts of heroism, patriotism and recovery.","811":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 5\u2014 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain made a five-hour visit to this nation of 140 million Muslims today bearing a promise central to preparations for an allied military thrust into Afghanistan -- that the target will be Osama bin Laden and, perhaps, the Taliban government, but not ordinary Afghans or their Islamic faith.","812":"The Soviet Union was known to have experimented with military uses of anthrax, as have about 10 other countries, including North Korea and Iraq. Some reports say that Osama bin Laden, whom Bush administration officials describe as head of the world's principal terror network, has also taken an interest in chemical and biological warfare.","813":"This demonstration was notable because it was not in a border city or a city strongly controlled by Islamic radicals, but just minutes away from Islamabad, the capital, a region considered less friendly to those who want to tie Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorism suspect, so tightly to the Islamic faith that an attack on him would be seen as an attack on Islam itself.","814":"Soon Mr. Gouttierre was teaching English and coaching basketball in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.

In this special we see Massoud, perpetually in combat fatigues and a crewneck sweater, sitting cross-legged on the floor and crouching over an old Soviet map as he plots his strategy against the Taliban. In interviews the camera easily captures why he was considered so charismatic: his face is sculptured in strong lines, his manner calm but forceful, his hat worn rakishly to the side in the manner of a politician who knows how to exploit his theatrical strengths.","816":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 5\u2014 Investigators have discovered that one of the suspected hijackers of the jet that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11 was tied to two previous attacks against American targets by Osama bin Laden's terror network, American and foreign officials said.","817":"The American case against Osama bin Laden has now been put before the world, thanks to Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair. Mr. Blair said Thursday that his review of the evidence left 'absolutely no doubt' that Mr. bin Laden and his terrorist network were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. Some Americans may be wondering whether the world will find those assurances from our closest European ally particularly convincing. But the report released by Britain, in a move coordinated with the White House, demonstrates that the Bush administration has enough information about the links between Mr. bin Laden, the Taliban leadership of Afghanistan and the terrorist assaults to make a strong case.","818":"Robert A. Pape and Chaim Kaufmann suggest (Op-Ed, Oct. 4) that by publicly disclosing concrete evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the recent attacks, it will be easier to gain support among the Arab public in the Middle East. The biggest deficiency in this approach is that there are no true democracies among the Middle Eastern Arab countries, and therefore no freedom of the press to reliably disseminate any of this concrete evidence.","819":"'What can I say to subdue their fear?' said Tony Scotti, who for decades has run a school in Bedford, Mass., that teaches security driving skills and surveillance detection. 'What do these people think? Is Osama bin Laden going to jump from a tree while they are driving from Teaneck? I am a businessman, of course, and yes, I want to train people.

Nearly 1,000 troops were said to be on the way.","821":"In Islamabad, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain promised the Pakistani government that the target of coming attacks would be Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and the Taliban, not the Afghan people and particularly not Islam.","822":"The novelist Alice Walker argued that the best way to punish Osama bin Laden for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 would be not to strike militarily: 'The only punishment that works is love.' Noam Chomsky, the perennial dissenter from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argued that American actions around the world had caused more death and destruction than took place in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Chalmers Johnson, a political science professor, in an article in The Los Angeles Times, wrote that a military 'overreaction' by the United States would turn the country into a 'rogue state' that would be subject to more terrorist attacks.","823":"Photo: Al-Jazeera, a Qatar-based channel, televised this image late on Thursday, saying it showed Osama bin Laden and his chief of military operations, Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, at a graduation ceremony for their fighters during which the two declared unification of their groups.

It is widely believed that Osama bin Laden, the prime terrorist suspect harbored by the Taliban, was behind that operation. Military officials say the Northern Alliance continues to pursue contacts with commanders in Taliban-controlled territory who might be willing to switch sides in the six-year-old civil war.","827":"Yet to hear people at the mosque tell it, curiosity has come with more support than hostility. And, they say, with the mosque only minutes from the gates of Fort Bragg Military Reservation, there is an ease and familiarity with a military that may soon be deployed overseas against Osama bin Laden, who has claimed to fight in the name of Islam.","828":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 5\u2014 The White House acknowledged today that it had coordinated and approved Britain's release on Thursday of details of the case against Osama bin Laden, even though it had declined, on national security grounds, to publish a similar accounting of the evidence against the suspected mastermind of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.","829":"It turned out, though, that Mr. Koranie could tolerate only the first step in what might be a wide-ranging campaign: eliminating Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks, even though Mr. Koranie made clear he did not believe Mr. bin Laden was responsible. 'If the Americans go beyond Afghanistan, I am against it,' he said. And if King Abdullah sided with the Americans in an attack on, say, Iraq? Mr. Koranie predicted an uprising. 'The streets will have another opinion.'","83":"Mr. Meskini's statement is seen as critical to the government's case in the terrorist plot, whose origins remain a mystery and whose target in the United States has also not been revealed.

Keenan sustained the government's objections and would not allow him to answer.","830":"ISRAEL ATTACKS PALESTINIANS -- Israel sent troops and tanks against Palestinian gunmen in Hebron, West Bank, killing five and wounding more than 40, in retaliation for the fatal shooting of three Israelis at a bus station. The attacks began hours after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon rebuked the United States over its efforts to persuade Arab nations to join a coalition against Osama bin Laden. A1","832":"Taliban Islamic fundamentalism has become, in recent years, too rigid, simplistic and oppressive to retain Afghan loyalties and too closely associated with the foreign methods and ambitions of Osama bin Laden and the Arab and other guests in his circle. Increasingly, it too has become reliant on regional and ethnic loyalties, in this case the loyalties of Pashtuns -- who make up the great majority of Taliban followers -- and in particular Pashtuns from the Kandahar region.","833":"Meanwhile, most liberals and a few chastened radicals view the Sept. 11 attacks through the prism of World War II. For them, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban represent what the author Christopher Hitchens labels, 'fascism with an Islamic face.' Echoing the words of Mr. Bush, the anti-terrorist left maintains there is a moral imperative to defend a society that remains, whatever its flaws, a pillar of ethnic and religious pluralism and representative democracy.","834":"The only problem with this otherwise laudable effort is that it doesn't hold up under inspection. The religious dimension of this conflict is central to its meaning. The words of Osama bin Laden are saturated with religious argument and theological language. Whatever else the Taliban regime is in Afghanistan, it is fanatically religious. Although some Muslim leaders have criticized the terrorists, and even Saudi Arabia's rulers have distanced themselves from the militants, other Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere have not denounced these acts, have been conspicuously silent or have indeed celebrated them. The terrorists' strain of Islam is clearly not shared by most Muslims and is deeply unrepresentative of Islam's glorious, civilized and peaceful past. But it surely represents a part of Islam -- a radical, fundamentalist part -- that simply cannot be ignored or denied.","835":"After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Bush administration quickly named Osama bin Laden as the leading suspect. Since then, a worldwide investigation has established links between his organization, Al Qaeda (the Base), and previous attacks on American targets -- a largely circumstantial case that NATO is using to press for military action. James Barron and David Corcoran","836":"President Bush singled out the group, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, in his Sept. 20 speech to a joint session of Congress, as a terrorist gang directly linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization. Last week, he added the movement to a list of 27 terrorist groups.","838":"The Bush administration needs to be cautious about what kinds of concessions it will make. Already, Washington appears to be deliberately, and wrongly, downplaying the issue of Russian human rights violations in Chechnya. Moscow has long claimed that Osama bin Laden and his allies have been training Chechen independence fighters, and it portrays the Chechen fighting as primarily a battle against radical Islamic terrorism. But the conflict between Russians and Chechens goes back centuries, and the two Russian military offensives there over the past decade have been accompanied by the brutal and widespread abuse of innocent civilians. Washington should continue to protest this inexcusable behavior.","839":"UNFRIENDLY GUERRILLAS -- A band of guerrillas trying to overthrow Uzbekistan's government poses a threat to the 1,000 American troops who just landed there. President Bush has said that the group, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, is linked to Osama bin Laden's organization. It is on a list of 27 international terrorist groups. B5","84":"Although the Taliban government is not recognized by United Nations members who will again consider what do with the Afghanistan next month, it is treated as the de facto government by United Nations agencies, which run programs there. Afghanistan is also under Security Council sanctions for refusing to turn over Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born militant, to American courts.","840":"Almost half of the men said they were from Afghanistan -- many were refugees. Many of them expressed disdain for the United States and a willingness to fight for Osama bin Laden.","841":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6\u2014 In the late 1980's, an American-based agent for Al Qaeda, the terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden, shipped to Afghanistan 25 military-style rifles capable of shooting down helicopters, piercing armor or destroying fuel tanks from long distances, according to a report by a gun control organization.","843":"Though the choice of Syria has generated criticism from some American Jewish groups, diplomats here say that American acquiescence is less a reflection of Washington's efforts to cobble together a coalition against Osama bin Laden than a recognition that there is no way to block the process without a major confrontation with the bulk of United Nations members over procedures that have evolved over five decades.","844":"But even though the United States wants and needs partners in its campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, it became increasingly clear that it is also prepared to strike against terrorists and their patrons largely on its own. An emerging reality is that Washington may have little alternative.","845":"Several of the young men said they could fight against a Muslim if they were convinced that the Muslim had committed a crime. They all said they were not convinced that Osama bin Laden -- or any Muslim, for that matter -- was behind the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, attacks that they condemned as violating all precepts of Islam.","846":"Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, Mr. O'Neill has led the American effort to seize the financial assets of people suspected of supporting Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network.","847":"'Despite the military buildup, Rumsfeld believes it won't be a cruise missile or bomber that takes out Osama bin Laden, but intelligence on the ground.'","848":"The faith that drives Osama bin Laden is a particularly austere and conservative brand of Islam known as Wahhabism. PAGE B7","849":"The unspoken message behind Mr. Tenet's memorandum was that the bureaucracy had grown too rigid in recent years, complicating the ability of intelligence agencies to confront a rapidly evolving threat like that posed by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his network. In effect, Mr. Tenet's memo echoed many of the sentiments voiced by the C.I.A.'s critics since Sept. 11.","85":"The dispute comes just three months before Mr. el-Hage and five co-defendants are to stand trial on allegations that they were part of a terrorist conspiracy led by Osama bin Laden. The government said the conspiracy was behind the bombings of embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in August 1998. More than 200 people died in the bombings, while thousands more were wounded.","850":"Similarly, the other countries Mr. Rumsfeld visited did not grant permission for the United States to carry out strikes directly from their soil, at least not publicly. Still, the administration insisted that it had what it needed -- overflight rights, limited basing rights and open political support -- to wage what it conceded would be a protracted war against Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and its hosts in Afghanistan.","851":"Pakistan, the front line state with the most to gain or lose in Afghanistan as the United States pursues Osama bin Laden, is another case in point. It has already won a lifting of sanctions and promises of international financial aid -- to the consternation of India, which until Sept. 11 reveled in the sense that it finally had gained the upper hand in South Asian relations with Washington. Now, prominent Pakistanis have been saying that in exchange for cooperation against the Taliban, they want the United States to help India and Pakistan resolve their own most intractable dispute, over Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state.","852":"Embarrassed by their impotence in stopping the Sept. 11 attack, the freaked-out F.B.I. and C.I.A. now cover themselves by issuing blanket warnings, telling Congress there is a strong chance America will be attacked again by Islamic sleeper agents once we retaliate against Osama bin Laden, and revealing to CNN that they are picking up the same patterns and language -- 'You will be happy soon' -- from terrorists under surveillance that were prevalent before Sept. 11.","853":"The last time the allied groups held power, in the early 1990's, the situation became so chaotic that the Taliban found an opening to come to power, promising to restore order to the nation with their strict interpretation of Islam. Now the Taliban are accused of harboring Osama bin Laden.","854":"Putting additional menace into that threat, the Taliban announced today that it would release eight aid workers on trial for promoting Christianity in Kabul -- but only if the United States 'stops issuing threats' of military action in support of its demand for the handover of Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.","855":"President Bush has a clear political goal: the eradication of the AlQaeda terrorist network and the toppling of the Taliban regime that supports it. But before the Pentagon has fired a single missile at Osama bin Laden or his hosts in Afghanistan, it has signaled that its military planning is guided by an entirely new set of rules.","856":"The president could not find the right words. Soon after the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked on Sept. 11, he tried to articulate his response. In one week he gave more than a dozen speeches and remarks to comfort, rally and then -- when he'd rallied too much -- calm the country. To some, his language seemed undisciplined. He called the terrorists 'folks' and referred to the coming battle as a 'crusade.' He called for 'revenge,' called Osama bin Laden the 'prime suspect' and asked for him 'dead or alive.' He said 'make no mistake' at least eight times in public remarks. When Bush didn't seem lost, he often seemed scared. When he didn't seem scared, he often seemed angry. None of this soothed the public. 'It was beginning to look like 'Bring Me the Head of Osama bin Laden,' starring Ronald Colman,' one White House official remembered.","857":"A Syrian businessman in Germany who is under investigation for possible links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers had closer ties to top aides of Osama bin Laden than was previously known, court records show.","858":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6\u2014 For all the emphasis that Pentagon planners have put on Special Operations forces in a war against the network of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government, at the moment relatively few of these secretive soldiers are within striking distance of the heart of Afghanistan, officials at the Pentagon say.","859":"JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 6\u2014 The faith that drives Osama bin Laden and his followers is a particularly austere and conservative brand of Islam known as Wahhabism, which was instrumental in creating the Saudi monarchy, and if sufficiently alienated, could tear it down.","86":"An Orlando, Fla., man who prosecutors say is a member of an organization led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was refused bail yesterday after a federal judge in Manhattan concluded he might flee before his trial. The defendant, Ihab M. Ali, was recently charged with perjury and criminal contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the bombings of two United States embassies in Africa in 1998. Mr. Ali was jailed for 16 months after being found in civil contempt for refusing, on religious grounds, to testify. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","860":"Q. -- How solid is the evidence that Osama bin Laden orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?","861":"But throughout the region, Arabs and other Muslims were glued to Al Jazeera television, the widely watched satellite station based in Qatar, which broadcast over and over its dramatic tape of Osama bin Laden, pitting the struggle of Islam against the West. Mr. bin Laden's stark challenge to the United States, which he pronounced a target for all true Muslims because of its alleged killing of Iraqi civilians and backing for Israel against Palestinians, was interspersed with coverage from inside Afghanistan, largely flashes in the dark.","862":"QUESTION. -- Was Osama bin Laden targeted in this raid? And can you give us -- I understand it's still early -- any preliminary assessment of how successful these attacks were?","863":"Following is a videotaped statement by Osama bin Laden broadcast yesterday by Al Jazeera in Qatar, as translated from the Arabic by Reuters.","864":"For three weeks Mr. Bush had issued ultimatums, threats to capture Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive' and warnings to Americans that they were in for a long war. Today, when he finally delivered the message that the action had begun, he and his aides chose the locale for the announcement with care: the Treaty Room of the White House, 'a place where American presidents have worked for peace,' he said -- and, conveniently, a place with windows that looked out on a brilliant day in Washington. It helped, his aides said, that as he spoke viewers could see cars zipping by the window behind him and someone flying a kite in front of the Jefferson Memorial.","865":"Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist leader, made it clear once again, on videtape, that he would not back off. The tape, date uncertain, was broadcast on Arabic satellite television. He challenged the allied efforts to picture him as a renegade who has corrupted the teaching of his faith, describing the American war against him as a war against Afghanistan and Islam. As long as it continues, he promised, Americans 'will never taste security.'","866":"Standing in sunlight somewhere, Osama bin Laden was saying through an interpreter, 'One day we will answer this degradation,' alluding to the bombing.","867":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7\u2014 Striking at night from aircraft carriers and distant bases, the United States and Britain launched a powerful barrage of cruise missiles and long-range bombers against Afghanistan today to try to destroy the terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network and the Taliban government that has protected it.","868":"LOS ANGELES\u2014 'America is full of fear,' crowed a jubilant Osama bin Laden, in his taped message anticipating our response to his massacre of the six thousand. 'They cry for their children.'","869":"Attempts to understand Osama bin Laden in terms of American support for Israel or rampant poverty in the Middle East will be illusionary. Values that are dear to us, like regional peace in the Middle East or a socially just division of wealth, are not dear to Osama bin Laden, and terrorists aim to achieve the antithesis of these things when they use extreme measures.","87":"But Judge Sand said that in light of legal precedent and the nature of the investigation of Osama bin Laden, the suspected leader, and his organization, al-Qaeda, 'Mr. el-Hage's speculations about the government's motives are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity.'","870":"Having supported Saddam Hussein in the gulf war and having seen some of their own international backing collapse as a result, Palestinians want to avoid the same problem. But many also sympathize with Osama bin Laden.","871":"He said the European Union deplored the failure of the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden despite repeated appeals that it do so.","872":"We ought to be concerned about the clandestine outbursts of Muslims in the United States who sympathize with the Palestinians, with the fanatic Muslim clergy or with the likes of Osama bin Laden (whom many see as a charismatic and courageous leader, not a fanatic terrorist).","873":"The more difficult task will be hunting down Osama bin Laden and helping the anti-Taliban foes within Afghanistan install a new government. In effect, the airstrikes were a conventional start to an entirely unconventional conflict.","874":"Part of the problem was that the networks have not had an easy time stationing people in Taliban-held Afghanistan, so reports from the ground there were hard to come by. All of the networks were helped by Al Jazeera, an Arab-language, 24-hour news channel. It had what was thought to be the only satellite uplink in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and all the networks showed its images of antiaircraft fire over the city. Later, it showed a video message from Osama bin Laden to the Muslim world, the first such video to be shown since Sept. 11. That, too, was carried by all the news networks.","875":"Since the attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, the Northern Alliance has become a chief focus of American-led efforts to topple the militant Islamic Taliban government that harbors the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden.","876":"BRONXVILLE, N.Y.\u2014 For Muslims of the Middle East and south and central Asia, the moment of reckoning arrived yesterday. The Bush administration has made what are, for an American government, extraordinary efforts to show that the war that began Sept. 11 will not be the war Osama bin Laden wants: a battle between Islam and the rest of the world, particularly the United States. Whether Muslims in the region accept, encourage and further this American effort will determine much of their fate in coming years. It will also determine how effective the war against terrorism will be.","877":"Leading American scholars and practitioners of Islam said yesterday that Osama bin Laden had twisted and debased Muslim theology in a videotaped statement in which he called on 'every Muslim' to 'rush to make his religion victorious' by emulating those who attacked the United States on Sept. 11.","878":"But with retaliatory strikes a possibility somewhere in America as a long campaign unfolds against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government in Kabul, the mayor said that many security measures taken in recent weeks would become part of the fabric of life in the region for weeks or months to come, and he urged people to get used to them.","879":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 7\u2014 Within hours of the first American bombs' dropping on Afghanistan, the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden, appeared in a videotape broadcast worldwide in which he taunted the United States and celebrated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","88":"But according to the State Department, several radical Islamic organizations operate in Yemen. They include the Palestinian group known as Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and cells linked to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi whom American officials blamed for the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998. The United States retaliated for those bombings 13 days later with missile strikes in Afghanistan and the Sudan.","880":"But some industry experts said the Saturday attack might be a hint of the growing restiveness in Muslim countries as their leaders side with the West against Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden.","881":"And so it began. With long-range bombers and cruise missiles, the anticipated attack on Afghanistan got under way, the goal being to destroy Osama bin Laden's terrorist training camps and to get rid of his Taliban protectors. 'Now the Taliban will pay a price,' President Bush said.","882":"For the majority of those interviewed, the air campaign ushered in a deep sense of foreboding that seemed to replace last month's horror and shock. No matter how obvious the retaliation had been, no matter how clearly it had been signaled from Washington, some people still carried a dim hope that Osama bin Laden might be caught and a full-scale military strike avoided.","883":"ASSAULT AGAINST AFGHANISTAN -- Striking at night, from aircraft carriers and distant bases, the United States and Great Britain launched a barrage of cruise missiles and long-range bombers against Afghanistan to try to destroy the terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden's movement, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban military that has protected it. A1","884":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7\u2014 United States investigators say they have determined that Osama bin Laden's top three lieutenants helped plan the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","885":"A wave of B-52 bombers dropped streams of huge unguided bombs across several training camps in the Baghlan Province north of Kabul that the officials said had recently been used by terrorist groups, including Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Though terrorists are likely to have fled in advance of the strikes, one senior military official said the camps had buildings and equipment worth destroying and military commanders chose a tactic intended to create widespread devastation.","886":"Pakistan, the only nation that still recognizes the Taliban government, was unsuccessful in efforts to broker a deal for the Afghan rulers to turn over Osama bin Laden, as the United States had demanded.","887":"Jeph Loeb, who writes another Superman comic for DC, argues that in the age of 24-hour television news, having the Man of Steel hunt down Osama bin Laden would feel false in a way that superheroes fighting Nazis did not.","888":"Time has not run out for the Taliban, which had been resigned to an American attack, but it has for the United States now that it has committed itself to a military solution. Killing Osama bin Laden may give immediate satisfaction, but it will do nothing to remedy, and will undoubtedly increase, the deep despair and hatred of the Muslim underclass -- the fertile ground that feeds terrorism.","889":"If the United States and its allies can quickly oust the Taliban, capture Osama bin Laden, and uproot his terrorist network, the odds of a deep recession will drop significantly. A victory will help consumer and business confidence, making companies more willing to invest and consumers more ready to spend. The travel industry, hard-hit, might see the greatest gains. 'A lot depends on the result of the attack,' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment officer for Advest.","89":"Other experts suggested that Osama bin Laden, who the United States believes was behind the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998, comes from an ethnically Yemeni family and has influence there, as does Iraq. The American ships refueling in Aden, which are part of the Fifth Fleet, largely help enforce the sanctions against Iraq.","890":"As President Bush rightly emphasized in his brief television address, these military actions represent just one front in a wider campaign that also includes diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement. Getting the proper balance will be complicated, and maintaining it will involve both skill and national self-control. To that end, initial military action should be carefully directed at the reasonable objectives Mr. Bush proclaimed yesterday -- to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base and to weaken the military capability of that country's ruling Taliban movement, which allows Osama bin Laden and his network to operate there.","891":"In a speech from 10 Downing Street, Mr. Blair forcefully depicted Britain's role as not simply joining a coalition against Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and supporters but rather as acting in Britain's national interest.","892":"The airstrikes on Taliban sites began what officials said would be a weeklong campaign, but Osama bin Laden was not a target. PAGE B4","893":"As President Bush rightly emphasized in his brief television address, these military actions represent just one front in a wider campaign that also includes diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement.

Lauding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. bin Laden vowed that 'America will not live in peace' as long as the goals of his group remain unmet. The tape had been left at the network's satellite uplink station in Kabul, said a spokesman for Al Jazeera.","896":"Despite assertions that satire and black comedy had become obsolete, Will Ferrell was back last weekend doing his President Bush impersonation on 'Saturday Night Live,' the satirical weekly The Onion was up and running with headlines like 'U.S. Vows to Defeat Whoever It Is We're at War With' and 'Rest of Country Temporarily Feels Deep Affection for New York,' and jokes about Osama bin Laden were circulating by e-mail. (One suggested that he be captured and punished by being given a complete sex change operation: 'Then we return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.')","897":"IF we assume the worst about Osama bin Laden (and why shouldn't we?), it is rational to fear that his video harangue broadcast on Sunday was a signal for another terrorist attack. In that case, which of the following would have been the most rational course of action yesterday for a person with a desire not to die?","898":"PLOT AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA -- American officials said Osama bin Laden plans to attack Saudi Arabia in an effort to oust the royal family. B4","899":"I believe that it would be appropriate to capture Osama bin Laden and the leadership of Al Qaeda and have them tried before an international court for their criminal acts, with the whole world watching, as was done with Adolf Eichmann. This would have a far greater deterrent effect on terrorism than giving them the martyrdom they surely see as one of their last options.","9":"Federal prosecutors, in a series of little-noticed court filings, have painted the most detailed picture yet of how Osama bin Laden directed what they depict as a worldwide terrorism conspiracy. The government has charged Mr. bin Laden with conspiring to attack Americans, specifically in the embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya. 1","90":"In May The Times reported that FAIR had run ads in Michigan suggesting that Senator Spencer Abraham's pro-immigration stance would make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to attack America. Such preposterous ads clearly spring from a sense of desperation among anti-immigration groups. Stoking anti-immigration rage is not an easy task when the nation's unemployment rate has dipped below 4 percent, and when the job market is eagerly seeking not only cheap labor for menial tasks but also skilled foreigners to keep the high-tech revolution in gear. Indeed, last week Congress voted to nearly double the number of visas for foreign workers with high-tech skills.","900":"Several hours after General Pervez made his remarks, officers close to him said he had not intended to be taken literally when speaking of the airstrikes ending so quickly. Rather, they said, what he meant was that 'the visible' part of United States and British strikes over Afghan cities, where live television coverage of explosions in the night sky are relayed around the world, should be concluded quickly, in any event no longer than a week or 10 days, while other 'invisible' air operations to disrupt hideouts and strongholds of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda continued.","901":"With his turban and camouflage jacket, his ornate Arabic and harsh vows of continued terror against America, Osama bin Laden revealed in his speech the instinctive cunning that has made him such a formidable foe.","902":"'I think it's important that we aren't afraid,' said Tim Amuchastegui, 50, a contractor from Klamath Falls, Ore. 'Osama bin Laden has done what he's done and he may do more. We came all the way across the country to show support for New York.'","903":"The order has resulted in the arrest of many immigrants suspected of involvement with groups linked to Osama bin Laden. But it has also met with resistance from F.B.I. agents who believed that surveillance -- if continued for days or weeks -- might turn up critical evidence to prove who orchestrated the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","904":"The United States attacked more targets like airfields, terrorist camps and Defense Ministry offices. But it did so with less than half the number of bombers, fighter planes and Tomahawk cruise missiles that were used on Sunday at the start of this operation to uproot Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and unseat the Taliban government that shields him.","905":"Re 'Extremism's Theological Roots,' by Mark Lilla (Op-Ed, Oct. 7): In a world without religion, Osama bin Laden and his kind would still exist, invoking some other ideology to justify their atrocities. Religion, because it is so open to interpretation, is a convenient place for a killer to hang his hat, but the ugliness in his heart is what drives him.","906":"While President Bush has vowed to hunt down Osama bin Laden, another crucial goal has been to pave the way for anti-Taliban rebels who are trying to overthrow Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme Taliban leader.","907":"As much as Hitler during World War II or Nikita S. Khrushchev in the cold war, Osama bin Laden has emerged as the enemy incarnate for an America fighting Islamic terrorism. Soon after President Bush declared he wanted Mr. bin Laden 'dead or alive,' in cowboy parlance, shooting ranges in the United States began selling targets of this bearded, turban-clad villain. Mr. bin Laden appeared to relish the role, judging by the tape of himself declaring holy war that was broadcast by the Pan-Arab Al Jazeera cable network after American and British forces launched air strikes on Afghanistan.","908":"There are the handwritten signs everywhere on the trading floor, labeling the booths by number and showing the locations of restrooms, as well as a few fliers containing unprintable sentences about Osama bin Laden.","909":"Spain and Italy joined France and Germany in pledging to send troops, if necessary. NATO agreed to send five Awacs early warning planes and crews to the United States to free up American surveillance aircraft for use in the campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.","910":"In sending his own police against a crowd of some 2,000 Palestinians, Yasir Arafat appeared to make a clear choice in the international battle against terror: he is with the United States, and against Osama bin Laden. But, on a day when Mr. Arafat, like many other Arab leaders, enveloped himself in silence, it was not clear why he had decided to act as he did.","911":"Mr. Hahn said in a statement today that the emphasis on security was partly a response to the prospect of terrorist attacks. The airport was the target of a foiled plot in 1999, an effort linked to agents of Osama bin Laden, and there has been great concern here about a second attempt.","912":"But if only time will salve their wounds, the military retaliation has comforted some grieving families by reaffirming that their losses, and now their own sacrifices, have not been forgotten. These families say that they have focused their anger on Osama bin Laden and his terrorists, in part, because there is little else they can do.","913":"He said that President Bush 'should use any legitimate means to go after the perpetrators.' But he cautioned that the quest for justice could cause the United States to itself be unjust. 'If we kill innocents, we create the conditions for another Osama bin Laden. Don't seek vengeance; seek justice.'","914":"Jordan has banned demonstrations for much of this year because of boiling sentiments over violence in the Palestinian territories, but the reaction there was also one of anger. 'Such acts are blind because the U.S. does not have any specific or strategic targets,' said Mahmoud Kharabsheh, an independent member of Parliament, dismayed about the lack of published evidence against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. 'If the U.S. possessed concrete evidence, it would have disclosed it to the world in order to convince them that they are the perpetrators. But what happened is only a cover for a crusader attempt to conquer the Arab and Islamic world.'","915":"The military strike against Afghanistan came as no surprise here because the diplomatic groundwork for cooperation was carefully laid by Washington and London. One day after the attacks in the United States, the Security Council adopted a resolution condemning them, and then passed another, on Sept. 28, obliging all 189 member countries to crack down on the financing, training and movement of terrorists. The Council also invoked earlier resolutions that assailed the Taliban for sheltering Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks.","916":"The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was apparently holed up in a bunker, he said, and the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, who is believed to have orchestrated the Sept. 11 terror attacks on America, remained unknown. There was no independent means of confirming those claims, which repeated earlier unconfirmed reports from Pakistani intelligence and other sources.","917":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 8\u2014 In recent months, Osama bin Laden and his allies have planned attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia as part of their continuing effort to oust the Saudi royal family, American officials said today.","918":"She asked if the strikes would ferret out Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the East Coast. Or would they cripple the Taliban, the ruling fundamentalist militia? Or both?","919":"I am not sure all our coalition partners in the war against Osama bin Laden understand that. The truth is, our real coalition partners can be counted on a few fingers: the British, France, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan. The Saudis, Egyptians and Syrians are not, and will not be, members of this coalition in any equal sense -- not because they don't have military power to contribute, but because deep down these Arab regimes do not share the values that we're trying to defend.","92":"Still, the officials said they had not ruled out any one of several other known terrorist groups, including followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom American officials blamed for the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","920":"John Cimaglia almost did not attend yesterday's Columbus Day parade up Fifth Avenue. So, yes, the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the four difficult weeks that followed, punctuated by Sunday's televised images of Osama bin Laden promising more havoc for the United States, have unnerved him a little, making him wary, invading his dreams.","921":"John Cimaglia almost did not attend yesterday's Columbus Day parade up Fifth Avenue.

'This is the first phase of our attacks on the Taliban regime, on bringing Osama bin Laden to account.'","923":"But in dismissing powerful aides who helped bring him to power two years ago and managed Pakistan's close ties to the Taliban, he has added kindling to a highly combustible political climate. As President Bush prosecutes his campaign against terrorism and Osama bin Laden, he must be mindful of General Musharraf's fragile position.","924":"For the first time in years, Mr. Arafat's security forces used deadly force against Palestinians to suppress a demonstration in support of Osama bin Laden. In a cloud of tear gas and a hail of bullets, two Palestinians -- one of them only 13 -- were slain. Another was close to death.","925":"Those who think the evidence points toward terrorism note that the contaminated building was close to an airport used for flight training by the terrorists, and that tabloids housed in the building had published cover articles highly critical of Osama bin Laden. But whether the bin Laden network would consider a supermarket tabloid a fit target seems dubious. This is a mystery that has only begun to be unraveled.","926":"CAIRO, Oct. 8\u2014 Osama bin Laden's internationally televised speech on Sunday mesmerized many Muslims with its religious and historical imagery, a powerful combination that only magnified his standing with people who wanted to see him as a heroic spokesman for the weak against the strong.","927":"Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, write out on the board or make copies of the following news excerpt: \u201cStriking at night from aircraft carriers and distant bases, the United States and Britain launched a powerful barrage of cruise missiles and long-range bombers against Afghanistan today to try to destroy the terrorist raining camps of Osama bin Laden\u2019s Qaeda network and the Taliban government that has protected it.\u201d As students enter class, ask them to respond in their journals to the following questions (written on the board for easier access): \u201cWhat feeling do you get when reading this sentence? What words and phrases evoke this feeling the most? What were the author\u2019s intentions when writing this piece? Did he intend to convey a specific feeling? Why or why not?\u201d 2. As a class, read and discuss the remainder of the article \u201cBush Warns \u2018Taliban Will Pay the Price\u2019,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. How did the U.S. respond to terrorist attacks on the night of October 7, 2001? b. Who ordered the strike on Afghanistan? c. According to President Bush, what were the strikes designed to do? d. According to the article, at what targets did the U.S. military aim? e. How did Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain respond to the strike, and what role did Britain play in supporting the offensive? f. According to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, who is the enemy and who is not? g. According to the article, what threat did Osama bin Laden issue on the first day of the U.S. strike? h. How did the Taliban\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan respond to the U.S. strike? i. How long might the aerial campaign against Afghanistan last, according to the article? j. How did Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld define the goals of this initial strike by the U.S.? k. In addition to military strikes, what else did the U.S. drop in Afghanistan? l. According to the article, what security measures did the F.B.I. and other U.S. agencies make in response to the military strike? m. What ultimatum did the United States convey to Indonesia following the strike? n. According to the article, what responses to the strike were made by officials in Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, France, Germany, Canada, and Iraq? Which countries supported the U.S.-led strike, and which ones opposed it? 3. Divide students into small groups of two or three, and assign each group a country. Suggested countries include those mentioned in the article \u2014 Canada, Germany, France, Britain, Russia, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan \u2013 though any country besides the U.S. will work. Allow students to search online news sources from their assigned country for articles about the initial attacks on Afghanistan and Al Qaeda bases. After finding an article, ask students to create a bulleted presentation poster that addresses each of the following: -What is the article\u2019s headline? How does this demonstrate the perspective of the news source? -After reading the article, what can you deduce about the perspective of the journalist? Do you feel guided in one direction or the other? Explain the journalist\u2019s intention. -What sources are listed in the article? -Count the number of quotations and statements that demonstrate support for the U.S. strike and those that convey opposition to the U.S. strike. How balanced is the coverage? In a future class, students should present their summary presentations. Allow other students to question the presenters about the news source\u2019s perspective, and as a class discuss whether or not students feel it\u2019s important to present a balance of perspectives. Suggested Online News Sources: Ecola Newsstand provides English language newspapers and magazines from around the world. Internet Public Library\u2018s collection of Online Newspapers. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Ask each student to write a personal reaction to the articles read in class. How did the article from the non-U.S. news source compare to the New York Times piece? Did both authors have similar intentions? How would you feel if you were a reporter covering this event? What pressures would you feel from your readers to convey an objective response? Or would there be greater pressure from readers to convey a response that was sympathetic only to their nation\u2019s view? Would a reporter from a country not directly affected by the recent terrorist attacks on the U.S. and the responding strike in Afghanistan feel different kinds of pressures? Why or why not?","928":"Pakistan, which shares a long border with Afghanistan and was instrumental in the rise of the Taliban, who control most of that country, is more crucial than India now to the campaign to deal with Osama bin Laden. India offered its unconditional support to the United States from the start, and Pakistan was forced to cooperate under the threat of being treated as a target itself.","929":"Only hours after his police officers battled in the streets of Gaza with Palestinian students who were demonstrating in support of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Arafat's representatives sat down with the leaders of the extremist group Hamas and other Palestinian factions to produce a joint statement: 'We must continue the intifada and the resistance to the Israeli occupation,' it read, in part.","93":"Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producer, is a close ally of the United States and the presence of American troops in the kingdom has been denounced by religious conservatives and by the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has made the expulsion of American troops his main demand.","931":"Indeed, the hazards until now have been minimal for American forces, who were described by officials in Washington as having essentially taken control of the Afghan skies while knocking out some of the larger and more sophisticated training camps of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. One camp near Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, was said by intelligence officials to have been a site for testing chemical and biological weapons.","932":"Mr. Clarke, who has extensive experience in the executive branch, became national counterterrorism coordinator at the Clinton White House. There he was considered abrasive and secretive. But he was nonetheless respected for his ability to get things done, and he has been watching Osama bin Laden for years.","933":"The groom was Said Bahaji, now the focus of an international manhunt for his suspected role in the Sept. 11 attacks. Prominent among the guests was Mamoun Darkazanli, a Syrian businessman suspected of being a financial conduit for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization. Another guest was Mr. Atta's friend, Marwan al-Shehhi, whom authorities say crashed the second hijacked airliner into the World Trade Center.","934":"CAIRO, Oct. 9\u2014 Just how big a threat to moderate Arab and Muslim regimes is Osama bin Laden's militant sword of Islam?","935":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9\u2014 Terrorists tied to Osama bin Laden's network and based in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the likely targets of future covert and overt American actions, United States officials said today.","936":"'I don't know who told the Pakistani president that,' Mr. Bush said. 'Generally, you know, we don't talk about military plans.' He said there was 'one way to shorten the campaign in Afghanistan, and that's for the -- Osama bin Laden and his leadership to be turned over so they can be brought to justice.'","937":"A news analysis article on Tuesday about assessments of the taped speech by Osama bin Laden misstated the government background of one authority, Daniel Benjamin, a former United States official who is writing a book on religious terror. He served in the Clinton administration, not the Bush administration.","938":"The service is given credit for thwarting a major terrorist attack on the eve of the millennium celebration in December 1999, when a customs inspector in Washington State found a trunkload of explosives in the car of an Algerian who later acknowledged having trained at terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden.","939":"'There's one way to shorten the campaign in Afghanistan,' Mr. Bush added, 'and that's for Osama bin Laden and the leadership of Al Qaeda to be turned over and brought to justice.'","94":"The statement did not say what the 'important evidence' referred to by Mr. Saleh was, but Yemeni officials said it did not mean that Yemen had any strong leads, despite its police sweep and what the officials described as 'several dozen' arrests of people being held for questioning. Yemen's official position in the last year has been that Islamic terrorist organizations that the State Department once described as having 'safe haven' in Yemen, including groups linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian-born millionaire who is the F.B.I.'s most-wanted terrorist suspect, have been crushed by crackdowns after previous terrorist incidents. Those included a hotel bombing in 1992 and numerous kidnappings of tourists, diplomats and others.","940":"Iraq is among a handful of countries that have not publicly condemned the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Aldouri told the United Nations General Assembly last week that Iraq had sent messages of condolences to individuals in the United States, but that it would have been hypocritical to condemn the bombings, given the sanctions and bombings against Iraq. Some officials in Washington have urged military action against Iraq as part of the campaign against Osama bin Laden and his terror network, contending that the Baghdad government is another sponsor of terrorism.","941":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9\u2014 The Pentagon is preparing to launch risky raids into Afghanistan using low-flying Army helicopter gunships to find and attack forces allied with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and the Taliban government, two senior Pentagon officials said today.","942":"But even if the political will exists to protect oil supplies, oil companies and producers are worried that terrorists could take aim at the vast web of infrastructure that carries oil around the world. Western oil companies for the last month have been scrutinizing their oil wells, flow stations, pipelines and refineries for vulnerability to attack and sabotage -- especially in countries where substantial numbers are sympathetic to Osama bin Laden's cause.","943":"A man facing trial on charges of taking part in a terror conspiracy with Osama bin Laden is in virtual solitary confinement and almost completely unable to leave his cell after the attack on the World Trade Center, his lawyer told a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday. After the court appearance, the lawyer, John Jacobs, also said he was considering asking the judge for a change of venue because he fears his client cannot receive a fair trial in Manhattan. The defendant, Mohamed Suleiman al Nalfi, a native of Sudan, 'has been in basically a total lockdown' in the Metropolitan Correctional Center since Sept. 11, Mr. Jacobs told the judge. But Mr. Jacobs said prosecutors had indicated that conditions might be relaxed after the sentencing this month of four terrorists convicted in the embassy bombings case. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","944":"The first episode, which was to have had its premiere in recent weeks but was held after the attacks, was shown to journalists in the summer. It portrayed the C.I.A. and the M.I. 6, its counterpart in Britain, as seeking to prevent a bomb attack in London by operatives for Osama bin Laden. 'They didn't think it was all that interesting,' Mr. Beckner said. That reaction, too, is unlikely with the current mood.","945":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 9\u2014 A top aide to Osama bin Laden appeared in a videotaped message tonight and implied that airplane hijackings like those that killed thousands of Americans at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon could be repeated.","946":"Al Jazeera has angered some Americans by replaying, several times, a 1998 interview with Osama bin Laden. It is surely Mr. bin Laden's favored news outlet, the one he chose to disseminate the video made after the Sept. 11 attacks. Al Jazeera is also the only station permitted to have a reporter inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. All these broadcasts are legitimate and valuable, and news organizations worldwide have repeatedly run Al Jazeera's tapes and reported its scoops.","947":"But a Congressional aide said that the president had been particularly outraged by an article in The Washington Post last Friday that asserted that 'intelligence officials have told members of Congress there is a high probability that terrorists associated with Osama bin Laden will try to launch another major attack on American targets here or abroad in the near future.'","948":"I would not describe Osama bin Laden's videotaped message as a 'taunt' from a 'defiant' terrorist (news articles, Oct. 8). It sounded more like a frustrated lament from a bitter and hate-filled man who is unable to live in peace, but unable to win his war.","949":"Administration officials said yesterday that the bombing of Afghanistan by American warplanes had destroyed at least seven of the largest and most sophisticated training camps that Osama bin Laden's network had long operated.","95":"That means that any prosecution that might ultimately result from the Yemen investigation would be brought by the office of Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose prosecutors have vast experience in terrorism cases, most recently in the investigation of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.","950":"The demand for restitution came just days before the four are to be sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan for their roles in the terrorism conspiracy. All four were convicted of conspiring in a plot led by Osama bin Laden to bomb two American Embassies in Africa in 1998, which killed 224 people.","951":"Al Jazeera has angered some Americans by replaying, several times, a 1998 interview with Osama bin Laden. It is surely Mr. bin Laden's favored news outlet, the one he chose to disseminate the video made after the Sept. 11 attacks. Al Jazeera is also the only station permitted to have a reporter inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. All these broadcasts are legitimate and valuable, and news organizations worldwide have repeatedly run Al Jazeera's tapes and reported its scoops.","952":"But a Congressional aide said that the president had been particularly outraged by an article in The Washington Post last Friday that asserted that 'intelligence officials have told members of Congress there is a high probability that terrorists associated with Osama bin Laden will try to launch another major attack on American targets here or abroad in the near future.'","953":"'The face and the voice of the enemy,' Peter Jennings said after showing Osama bin Laden's videotaped message following the attacks on Afghanistan Sunday. But as strange as it was to see the enemy with such sudden and chilling intimacy in our living rooms -- that gaunt, incongruous figure in a traditional turban holding a modern microphone -- the bin Laden tape was only the first dramatic marker of how different this televised conflict is from any war coverage we have known.","954":"The organization of Osama bin Laden threatened more terrorist attacks on Americans in a second taped message yesterday, obliging television news executives to consider whether broadcasting such statements served viewers, or Al Qaeda's propaganda goals.","955":"HITTING BIN LADEN -- American bombing has destroyed many of the largest and most sophisticated of Osama bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said. A1","956":"There has been only one request for an Osama bin Laden mask, which Mr. Bianchi does not have, although he said he had heard rumors that a factory in Mexico is rushing to make them. Anyway, he said, political figures always sell better for political demonstrations than for Halloween.","957":"So far the administration has struggled to maintain the appropriate balance. Yesterday, for example, the White House requested that broadcast network executives not air in full the prerecorded statements of Osama bin Laden and his aides. The White House expressed concern about giving the terrorists unchecked outlets for their propaganda. It also warned that such appearances might contain coded messages meant for bin Laden operatives around the world. The five major television news organizations agreed jointly to abridge future videotaped statements. The White House suggested that print media might also be asked not to publish the complete texts of Mr. bin Laden's statements.","958":"'Osama bin Laden is not responsible for this county's budget problems,' said Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the County Legislature's minority leader, a Republican. 'The county executive has submitted a flawed budget.'","959":"Mr. Sheikh reappeared as one of a gang who kidnapped three British tourists in India on behalf of a Kashmiri separatist group, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen -- an organization now viewed as one of the myriad Islamic groups possibly linked to Osama bin Laden, America's prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The young Briton was shot and captured in a subsequent Indian police raid, then jailed.","96":"Tonight, American officials here reiterated that they had no firm leads on the Cole's attackers. Partly because of Yemen's history as a refuge for Islamic and leftist radical groups, theories in Aden have covered a broad spectrum of possibilities. The most common one is that the attack may be linked to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, who has been indicted in the United States in connection with the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.","960":"A senior Philippine official said yesterday that the United States planned to send a 'sizable' contingent of military advisers to the Philippines in the next few weeks to help it crackdown on terrorist groups suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden.","961":"AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 10\u2014 The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon brought immediate accusations not only against Osama bin Laden but against Saddam Hussein of Iraq as his likely partner in crime.","962":"The decision to shift authority over potential criminal prosecutions stemming from the Sept. 11 terror attacks from New York to Washington has upset and frustrated law enforcement officials who have investigated Osama bin Laden for nearly a decade.","963":"While Mrs. Zia has been supportive of the American campaign to capture Osama bin Laden, the Jamaat leader, Matiur Rahman Nizami, said in an interview that the United States did not have enough evidence against Mr. bin Laden to justify military attacks and warned that the bombing 'would definitely cause widespread anger and revulsion in the entire Muslim world.'","964":"'Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War,' researched and written by a strong interdisciplinary team of writers for The New York Times, is an impressive account of the evolution of biological weapons over the last 70 years, from the intensely secret, state-run programs in the United States and the Soviet Union to the less disciplined and more dangerous flirtation with lethal agents in recent years by small adversaries of the United States like Iraq and by presumably well-financed terrorists like Osama bin Laden.","965":"The five major television news organizations reached a joint agreement yesterday to follow the suggestion of the White House and abridge any future videotaped statements from Osama bin Laden or his followers to remove language the government considers inflammatory.","966":"Mr. Musharraf's declaration yesterday that 'no extremist activity will be tolerated in any quarter of Pakistan' came in response to serious anti-American protests. On the same day, one radical Pakistani Islamist leader vowed to send 10,000 warriors 'against U.S. and all the infidel forces.' Soldiers were deployed and sandbag bunkers set up here in the capital. A poll showed 62 percent of Pakistanis opposing involvement in the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Even Mr. Musharraf's grip on his own armed forces has been called into question.","967":"American warplanes pounded barracks, garrisons and troop encampments across Afghanistan in what appeared to be the most punishing air strikes yet against the ground forces of the Taliban regime. Troops in the field have been largely spared, with planes concentrating on striking command centers, airfields and the terrorist training camps of Osama bin Laden. A1","968":"Photos: Three men suspected of ties to Osama bin Laden were held yesterday. They are, from top, Lased bin Heni, Riyadh Jelassi, and Muhammad bin Belgacem Awadi. (Associated Press); (Reuters)","969":"The statement by an 'authorized security source' came in the form of partial confirmation of a magazine article that blamed Al Qaeda, the terror network run by Osama bin Laden, for the New York and Washington attacks.","97":"Prosecutors say Mr. Salim, who is from Sudan, was a senior deputy to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, and that he tried to obtain materials on Mr. bin Laden's behalf that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Salim was placed on a suicide watch in a Munich jail cell, the German official, Rupert Folger, said.","970":"American officials say they have evidence that Osama bin Laden is using a network of shops that sell honey -- a staple of Middle Eastern life since biblical times -- to generate income and secretly move weapons, drugs and agents throughout Al Qaeda, his terrorist network.","971":"If the statement's language seemed murky, Washington policy makers could still breathe a deep sigh of relief at moving past a first test of their bombing raids. The emergency gathering of the Organization of the Islamic Conference had been called by Iran. Evidence of significant opposition could have shredded American efforts to build an alliance that included Arabs and Muslims against Osama bin Laden and other terrorists.","972":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 10\u2014 President Bush today announced the creation of a most wanted list of international terrorists, a roster of 22 suspects led by Osama bin Laden and several of his lieutenants.","973":"Far from avoiding the Arab press, the United States should appoint a spokesperson to Al Jazeera. Osama bin Laden has been openly appealing for support from the Muslim 'man on the street.' Shouldn't we be doing the same?","974":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 10\u2014 Saudi Arabia has so far refused to freeze the assets of Osama bin Laden and his associates, and has proved unwilling to cooperate fully on the investigation of the hijacking suspects in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Bush administration officials said today.","975":"Osama bin Laden skillfully used television news programs to deliver his defiant message.","976":"In choosing Mr. Kallstrom, Mr. Pataki has reached out to someone with a great deal of knowledge about the Islamic terrorist networks in this region, having been part of the investigation into the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and later plots by other Islamic fundamentalist terrorists with links to Osama bin Laden.","977":"Photo: Posters of 22 fugitives, including Osama bin Laden, lined a wall yesterday at F.B.I. headquarters, where President Bush announced a list of leading terrorism suspects. Page B3. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)","978":"In Gaza, Abu Osama Awad tried to untangle the contradictions exposed by the bombing. 'If we support bin Laden, it means that the Palestinians are going to lose,' said Mr. Awad, 36, owner of a juice factory, referring to Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11. 'Because we will lose the support of Europe and America.","979":"Pakistani intelligence officials said tonight that there was no evidence that any senior member of the Taliban or Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, had been killed in the initial attacks.","98":"Officials said they received reports in May that a group linked to Osama bin Laden was preparing an attack on American targets. PAGE A14","980":"Having already claimed to basically own the Afghan skies, the Americans looked to 'condition the environment' -- Pentagon-speak for weakening both the Taliban and Arab fighters enlisted by Osama bin Laden, so American and British special forces may eventually be able to operate with some safety inside Afghanistan.","981":"During the last four weeks, the authorities in eight European countries have fanned out through the slums of London, Madrid, Milan and other cities to smoke out and smash what they say are militant cells with links to Osama bin Laden.","982":"DENVER, Oct. 11\u2014 Beside the T-shirts emblazoned with American flags, the Statue of Liberty and other patriotic symbols, a souvenir shop here is selling one that bears the face of Osama bin Laden in a Wild West poster format that says, 'Wanted, Dead.'","983":"We are proof that society does not require all its citizens to share the same religious belief, as Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda assert.","984":"Using a mixture of straight talk, statesmanship and a touch of humor here and there, Mr. Bush clarified and sharpened his positions on several important issues. It was heartening to hear him say the United States and its allies will not walk away from Afghanistan once Osama bin Laden and his followers are captured or killed. His inclination to seek the assistance of the United Nations in establishing a new government in Kabul if the Taliban is ousted was wise. And his reaffirmation of the need for humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan -- including donations from American children -- seemed heartfelt. Mr. Bush may have scrambled his stern message slightly when he offered to reconsider the military assault on Afghanistan if the Taliban leadership surrenders Mr. bin Laden, but the gesture is likely to reassure other Muslim nations that Washington is not bloody-minded.","985":"His aides have said that Mr. Bush does not intend to keep the military in Afghanistan if the Taliban and its allies in Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network are defeated. But as Andrew Johnson discovered after the Civil War, as Harry Truman discovered after dropping the atom bomb, and as Bill Clinton discovered in Bosnia and Kosovo, the peace is not won when the fighting ends, it is won by rebuilding so that a defeated country does not implode again.","986":"The Bush administration asked newspapers not to publish full transcripts of statements by Osama bin Laden. B7","987":"MATTHEW F. BOGDANOS, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the rap mogul SEAN COMBS on weapons and bribery charges, would have joined the hunt for Osama bin Laden by now. Mr. Bogdanos, 44, is a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve. But the Marines delayed the date on which he was to report for duty until after his family returned to their apartment in Lower Manhattan.","988":"Vladimir Putin would also like to seize the opportunity to improve his standing with the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Many expected him to demand Western approval for Russia's antiterrorist war in Chechnya, and a slowdown of NATO's plans to expand to include the Baltic states, as the price for his support for the war against Osama bin Laden and his kind. Instead, he has used that support as a launch pad for a strategic campaign to have Russia accepted as a full member of the West, and of Europe. The NATO secretary-general, Lord George Robertson, confirms that at his Oct. 2 meeting with Mr. Putin the Russian president made it plain that while he still did not like the idea of the Baltic states joining NATO, he was not going to invest political capital in attempting to stop it.","989":"DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 10\u2014 Walter Mourad wants vengeance against Osama bin Laden for messing with an American dream built on a firm foundation of dry cleaning.","99":"The group said to be preparing the attack was the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a faction of which is closely associated with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier who tops the United States list of most-wanted terrorists. The Jihad and Mr. bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda, or 'the base,' have come under scrutiny by American and Yemeni officials as possible culprits in the bombing last Thursday of the American destroyer Cole in Aden, Yemen, an attack that killed 17 sailors.","990":"President Bush and other senior administration officials have indicated that they would like to topple the Taliban government quickly so as to lower military resistance to operations by special forces aimed at capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and eliminating his terrorist network.","991":"As a follower of the Prince of Peace, I am deeply pained, as I know so many others are, that the failure of diplomatic initiatives has resulted in the recent military strikes that our government and its allies have launched against the terrorist forces of Osama bin Laden and his supporters among the Taliban in Afghanistan (front page, Oct. 10).","992":"The White House has asked U.S. networks to limit broadcasts of statements by Osama bin Laden. I wish that instead of censorship, the president would respond to him. Here's what Mr. Bush could say:","993":"Western experts say that small numbers of Chinese Uighurs have trained or fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan and that arms have sometimes been smuggled from Central Asia into Xinjiang. However, there is no evidence that the Taliban or Osama bin Laden have seriously targeted China for subversion.","994":"Q. You said that the threat is ongoing and indeed the deadly virus of anthrax was found in three Florida people this week. Osama bin Laden's spokesman said storms of planes are yet to be hijacked. The -- your F.B.I. warned just today that terrorist attacks could be happening again in the next couple days. If the F.B.I. knows of a credible threat, can you assure the public that you would take the precaution of locking down any system involved, whether it's buildings, airports, water systems, to prevent more deaths? And most importantly, is there anything you can say to Americans who feel helpless to protect themselves and their families from the next wave of attacks, if there are more to come? What can people do to protect themselves?","995":"Rogge, who was a member of Belgium's rowing team at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, where 11 members of Israel's team were killed by Palestinian terrorists, said he had never heard of a credible threat against the Olympics by Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of organizing the Sept. 11 attacks.","996":"In an echo of 1990, Osama bin Laden tried, in his videotaped message this week, to make the same linkage, tying his actions to the cause of Palestine, declaring, 'America will not live in peace before peace reigns in Palestine.' Much like Saddam Hussein, he is trying to gain legitimacy by implying that his attack on America was about the plight of the Palestinians.","997":"The Bush administration asked newspapers yesterday to refrain from publishing full transcripts of statements issued by Osama bin Laden or his followers, asserting that such statements could inflame Mr. bin Laden's followers and may contain coded messages that could incite attacks on American targets.","998":"As a citizen, I was disturbed by President Bush's comments regarding the leak of information as well as by his request that the TV networks abridge statements by Osama bin Laden and his aides. One clear distinction between us and these extremists is our freedom of the press. Jeopardizing this basic constitutional right, which forms the bedrock of a democratic society, would amount to nothing more than endorsing a tactic used by repressive regimes around the world.","999":"The option of pursuing other terrorists groups in other Arab countries is still to be explored. But American officials said they are concerned that allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia do not yet fully grasp that Mr. Bush's 'new war' against terrorism may not end with the elimination of Osama bin Laden and could involve chasing terrorist groups in other countries.","1001":"Thanks to one sentence, leading politicians accused him of being an anti-American apologist for Osama bin Laden and demanded he resign.","1002":"We will not understand Osama bin Laden's position any better if the press censors everything he says that the government considers inflammatory.","1003":"The free air time provided to the Taliban could swell the ranks of its sympathizers and place our soldiers and citizens at additional risk. If the board governing the Voice of America refuses to censor interviews of Osama bin Laden's Taliban hosts, Congress must act.","1004":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 11\u2014 President Bush said today that United States forces would attack Afghanistan for 'as long as it takes' to destroy the Qaeda terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, but he offered to reconsider the military assault on Afghanistan if that country's ruling Taliban would surrender Mr. bin Laden.","1005":"But he did say the United States remained wary. 'There's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man,' Mr. Bush said. 'We're watching him very carefully.' Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has been more visible and vocal than even President Bush in trying to explain the goals of the attacks on Afghanistan and the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, has been hoping to persuade the Bush administration to recognize the need for helping Afghanistan when military action ceases.","1006":"During the last four weeks, the authorities in eight European countries have fanned out through the slums of London, Madrid, Milan and other cities to smoke out and smash what they say are militant cells with links to Osama bin Laden.","1007":"DENVER, Oct. 11\u2014 Beside the T-shirts emblazoned with American flags, the Statue of Liberty and other patriotic symbols, a souvenir shop here is selling one that bears the face of Osama bin Laden in a Wild West poster format that says, 'Wanted, Dead.'","1008":"In his talks with Arab leaders, his aides said, he has stressed his commitment to reviving Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and his opposition to widening the war to include Iraq. At the same time, they said, he has tried to avoid the appearance that he was making those pledges as a way of appeasing Osama bin Laden.","1009":"A front-page article on Wednesday about the possibility of action by the United States against terrorist groups in the Philippines and Indonesia misidentified the leader of Abu Sayyaf, an organization tied to Osama bin Laden that operates from the Philippines. The leader was believed to be Khaddafi Janjalani. (Abdujarak Abubakar Janjalani was his brother, who founded and headed the group but was reportedly killed in a firefight in the Philippines in 1998.)","1010":"The group is building its case despite President Bush's declaration that the war against Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda, must be fought first. The idea is to prepare for what its members see as the coming debate over the next phase of the war.","1011":"In recent days, senior counterintelligence officials have told the White House and Congress in classified briefings that Osama bin Laden's terror network, Al Qaeda, presented a continuing threat fully capable of renewed attacks in the United States or overseas.","1012":"We must now wonder, when seeing one of Osama bin Laden's videotapes, what else he said that has been edited out (which the rest of the world will hear and see anyway). That dark unknown is far more damaging in the long run than any seemingly inflammatory words he might have actually spoken.","1013":"MANILA, Oct. 6\u2014 Last month, the United States thrust this Asian country into an awkward spotlight, declaring that Muslim militants in the southern Philippines had financial ties to Osama bin Laden.","1014":"Osama bin Laden has cited Islamic law to justify his terror against the United States, a view that most Islamic scholars say is a gross distortion. Nonetheless this highly unorthodox view is finding some support in the Muslim world. This is an excerpt from an article by Muhammad Ishrat Husain, a retired accountant, that appeared on Oct. 5 in the opinion section of Dawn (www.dawn.com), the largest English-language newspaper in Pakistan. He is writing about the Koranic justifications for jihad and qital, or combat.","1015":"On your Oct. 12 front page, you quote President Bush as telling the Taliban to 'cough him up,' referring to Osama bin Laden, along with the 'thugs and criminals' who are his associates.","1016":"Vice President Dick Cheney said last night in an interview with Jim Lehrer of PBS that there could be links between the anthrax cases and Osama bin Laden. 'We know that he has over the years tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction, both biological and chemical weapons,' he said. And while cautioning that there was not enough evidence to positively establish a connection, Mr. Cheney said, 'I think the only responsible thing for us to do is proceed on the basis that it could be linked.'","1017":"But the United States government now says that Mr. Qadi and many other well-connected Saudi citizens have transferred millions of dollars to Osama bin Laden through charities and trusts like the Muwafaq Foundation supposedly established to feed the hungry, house the poor and alleviate suffering.","1018":"Long before Osama bin Laden appeared on television screens with an AK-47 by his side, he released earlier videotapes in which he appears in the guise of a holy man, sitting peacefully in front of a wall of books. That scholarly backdrop is an important symbol for Mr. bin Laden's terrorist movement as he tries to legitimize his extremist views of Islam.","1019":"The suit, filed late on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan, identified the plaintiff only as Jane Doe and named as defendants Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, Afghanistan and the ruling Taliban.","1020":"'Every Muslim Is Osama bin Laden'","1022":"American attacks resumed early this morning near Kabul. American officials said they were looking for moving targets of opportunity that included Taliban leaders as well as Osama bin Laden and members of his Al Qaeda network.","1023":"Ministers have also questioned American evidence whether Osama bin Laden is responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the use of force against Afghanistan, where Mr. bin Laden is in hiding.","1024":"'Death to Bush!' they yelled. In the United States, the 'war against terrorism' is described as a duel between good and evil. But most of the protesters are working from a much different set of premises. To them Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden -- from a remote perch in Afghanistan -- is an unlikely suspect in the terrorism of Sept. 11.","1025":"LINKS TO SAUDI ARABIA -- American officials say several Saudi citizens have transferred millions of dollars to Osama bin Laden through charities and trusts. B3","1026":"We learned this week that if we can't bring Osama bin Laden to justice dead or alive, the White House can still slap him with that most American form of capital punishment -- kicking him off network television.","1027":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12\u2014 The Bush administration vowed today to seize the assets of more individuals it says support terrorism, including a prominent businessman from Saudi Arabia, a United States ally whose reluctance to move against people and groups with ties to Osama bin Laden has become a politically sensitive issue.","1029":"The Bush administration disclosed more elements of a rapidly expanding military and financial campaign against Osama bin Laden's network, talking yesterday of impending operations on the ground in Afghanistan, and naming an additional 27 individuals and groups as financial supporters of the terrorists. The list included a prominent Saudi businessman, adding to pressure on the reluctant Saudi royalty to take stiffer measures against financiers in their country.","1030":"Some of the 100 or so people who gathered in a mosque in an old house denounced terrorism but criticized American policy in the Middle East. They were eager for retribution against Osama bin Laden but unhappy with the bombing of Afghanistan. They considered themselves devout Muslims even as their brethren overseas branded them infidels.","1031":"As the seventh day of the air assault unfolded with raids on Kabul and Kandahar, Taliban leaders rejected Mr. Bush's offer on Thursday to consider halting the attacks if they handed over Osama bin Laden, promising to fight to their last breath. They also claimed that the airstrikes had killed more than 300 civilians, a claim that was impossible to verify.","1033":"He pointed out that the Oct. 2 issue of The Globe included sharp coverage of Osama bin Laden, the man the government has identified as the chief suspect in the attacks. 'Wanted: Bin Laden. Inside his Sick, Twisted World,' read the cover headline.","1035":"CAIRO, Sunday, Oct. 14\u2014 A Kuwaiti spokesman for Osama bin Laden issued a blistering televised threat early today to kill Westerners, whether in their home countries or in the Persian Gulf area. In the process, he directly linked the bin Laden network to the attacks in the United States on Sept. 11.","1036":"Two Palestinians were killed and dozens were injured as Yasir Arafat's security forces fired on demonstrators marching in the Gaza Strip against the attack on Afghanistan and in favor of Osama bin Laden. The worst Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence in years, it reflected Mr. Arafat's fear of alienating the United States. The fighting also appeared to widen the division between Mr. Arafat and the Islamist group Hamas, which organized the rally. James Bennet","1037":"Regarding the videotape of Osama bin Laden in which he appeared in a rocky outcrop and praised the hijackers, you write (front page, Oct. 8), 'Where the rocky outcrop might be was anybody's guess, although the fact that the tape was delivered to Al Jazeera in Kabul suggested that it was probably made somewhere in Afghanistan.'","1038":"The Al-Qadir Trading Company and its owner, Abdul Manan Agha, were identified Friday by the United States as part of the shadowy financial network that supports Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","1039":"Colby and her boyfriend, Karim, sat around his pool with friends who were Syrian, Egyptian and Lebanese and talked about terrorism. Since they met two years ago, Colby had been 'receiving an introduction' to Karim's culture, and sometimes it seemed as if there were too many bridges to cross: strange misunderstandings, parts of his behavior he refused to explain. Now Karim and his friends plainly laid out the ways irrational violence affects civilian life. Colby was grateful to listen. One of Karim's friends, she told me, had met Osama bin Laden in Lebanon.","1040":"President Bush declared war on terrorism the day that hijackers slammed commercial airliners into the trade center and the Pentagon, killing more than 5,000 people. But the actual military response, by American and British forces, did not begin until a week ago, Oct. 7. Bombers, fighter planes and Tomahawk cruise missiles pounded terrorist camps run by Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and knocked out the airfields and other military strongholds of his Taliban protectors. Within a couple of days, the Americans were able to claim that they basically controlled the Afghan skies, though Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said on Friday that not all of the Taliban's air-defense capabilities had been knocked out.","1041":"Summon all the healthy skepticism rightfully applied to a story involving Osama bin Laden and a Muppet. Add to that a heightened post-Sept. 11 suspicion of Internet hoaxes.","1042":"A spokesman for Osama bin Laden issued a blistering televised threat to kill Westerners. The White House called it propaganda. Page B1.","1043":"American strategy in the Middle East has long relied on Egypt as a moderating force, particularly in the conflict with Israel, and Saudi Arabia as a stabilizing influence on the weak tribal regimes of the Persian Gulf, which control oil riches. Washington's appeal now would seem to be tailor-made for them. The Egyptians have known terrorism first hand -- President Hosni Mubarak was the target of an assassination attempt by Islamic militants in 1995. His predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was killed by them in 1981. The Saudi royal family, whose power rests on its claim to religious piety, has endured Osama bin Laden's charge of being unfit to oversee the holy places of Mecca and Medina.","1044":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 13\u2014 Senior Saudi officials rejected today American accusations that the kingdom is not choking off the money supply to Osama bin Laden, accusing Washington of again leveling charges against groups or individuals here without providing any proof.","1045":"Taliban leaders rejected today President Bush's offer of a second chance to surrender Osama bin Laden and stop the week-long bombing.","1046":"BOSTON\u2014 These events have split the whole world into two camps: the camp of belief and the camp of disbelief,' Osama bin Laden said in his speech televised on the day America started bombing Afghanistan. And he left no doubt about the beliefs to which those in the first camp must adhere. 'There is only one God,' Mr. bin Laden told his listeners. 'And I declare that there is no prophet but Muhammad.'","1047":"That sympathizers of Osama bin Laden sink three oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz and choke off the narrow, bow-shaped channel that funnels 14 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. That the United States attacks Iraq, and Israel launches a huge strike against the Palestinians, driving them from their camps and staking out more land -- all of which spurs the Persian Gulf states to cut off oil for the West. Or perhaps that a popular uprising, led by sympathizers of Mr. bin Laden, topples the ruling Saud family in Saudi Arabia, by far the world's largest oil producer.","1048":"Cafepress.com, which helps companies sell merchandise on the Web, has over 200,000 clients. Many of them are now selling special designs to raise money for the Red Cross Liberty Fund. One, Newgrounds (www.cafepress.com /newgrounds911), has T-shirts and a mouse pad with a 'Have you seen me?' milk carton picture of Osama bin Laden:","1049":"Nor, like many Afghans, has he much love for what the United States did years earlier when it poured money and weapons into the hands of the guerrilla factions that in time used those weapons to start a civil war. Those resources went into the hands, too, of Osama bin Laden, a Saudi Islamic militant who at the time hated the United States about as much as the Soviet Union.","1050":"The protests spread to Germany yesterday as thousands of people held peaceful protests in several cities. On Arabic television, a Kuwaiti spokesman for Osama bin Laden issued a blistering threat to kill Westerners.","1051":"The allies' military tactics and political statements make clear that the United States intends to remove the Taliban, which it accuses of harboring Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network. Steps are under way to usher in a broad-based government under the temporary stewardship of the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah.","1052":"Officials say an even smaller number are followers of Osama bin Laden whose arrests may have disrupted other terror plots being planned. However, officials acknowledge that the evidence of other terror operations remains circumstantial.","1053":"Accordingly, Mr. Martens altered the class outline, focusing much more on Osama bin Laden, the terrorist group Al Qaeda and the Middle East in general. He explained patterns in terrorists' motivations and behaviors, drawing parallels between Mr. bin Laden and domestic terrorists including Timothy McVeigh and the Ku Klux Klan.","1054":"The storytellers no longer come. There is just one story now, at least one acceptable story. It is the one taught in the seminaries, called madrassas, that have become incubators in Pakistan for the holy warriors who say they will die to defend Islam and their hero, Osama bin Laden, from the infidels. In many of the 7,500 madrassas in Pakistan, inside a student body of 750,000 to a million, students learn to recite and obey Islamic law, and to distrust and even hate the United States.","1055":"The largesse has come raining down with the ordnance because this war is at least partly about Afghanistan's extreme poverty. Once solely a matter of moral concern, the nation's destitution has become a security threat because it has helped create a fertile recruiting ground -- and a compliant host -- for Osama bin Laden.","1056":"The United States rained bombs on Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden promised holy war. The F.B.I. warned of new terrorist attacks in the United States. And an anthrax scare spread from Florida to Manhattan. The stock market, however, showed some spunk.","1058":"A MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE -- The Central Intelligence Agency intercepted a cryptic but chilling message last year from a member of Al Qaeda, who boasted that Osama bin Laden was planning to carry out a 'Hiroshima' against America, according to government officials. Still, officials acknowledged they failed to grasp the organization's transformation from an obscure group of Islamic extremists into the world's most dangerous terrorists. A1","1059":"And while we're at it, perhaps we could take the time to change the way we use another word: 'revolutionary.' Look, a gadget isn't revolutionary if it locates the position of your car on Earth. It would be revolutionary if it located Osama bin Laden, then compiled a legal case against him.","1060":"Before Sept. 11, Mr. Hijazi, 32, was already a prisoner of the first order: a man accused of leading a cell of terrorists in Jordan connected to Osama bin Laden. The foiled plot: to kill Americans here by blowing up a big hotel and several holy sites.","1061":"The Central Intelligence Agency intercepted a cryptic but chilling message last year from a member of Al Qaeda, who boasted that Osama bin Laden was planning to carry out a 'Hiroshima' against America, according to government officials.","1062":"Nine months earlier, he had been identified to American intelligence agents as one of Osama bin Laden's operatives in the United States. American customs agents knew about money he had transferred to an associate of Osama bin Laden in the Middle East. And the Boston police had issued a warrant for his arrest after he violated probation for stabbing a friend with a knife.","1063":"Moments of international crisis have a way of stripping away diplomatic facades and exposing uncomfortable truths. One of the disturbing realities clarified by last month's terror attacks is Saudi Arabia's tolerance for terrorism. Students of America's deeply cynical relationship with Riyadh have long known that the kingdom did little to discourage Islamic extremists, as long as they operated outside its borders, and that Washington muted its objections to keep oil flowing to the West. It is now clear that the Saudi behavior was more malignant. With Riyadh's acquiescence, money and manpower from Saudi Arabia helped create and sustain Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization.","1064":"'It depends how you define the war,' said Joseph S. Nye, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a former assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration. 'If you define it as getting rid of Osama bin Laden or disrupting Al Qaeda, you can have measures of success. But that's not victory in the war on terrorism, that's victory against a particular objective.'","1065":"Unlike Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mughniyah is the ultimate faceless terrorist. Sometimes described as a senior intelligence officer of Hezbollah and sometimes as the group's operations chief or security chief, he is thought to be the mastermind behind many deadly attacks on American targets overseas that have involved hijackings and the taking of hostages.","1066":"Toward the end of the editorial, Uncle Sam is seen pointing elsewhere: 'He's pointing at you, Osama bin Laden, and every other organization that spends its entire existence trying to buy what can't be bought and break what cannot be broken.'","1067":"There are plenty of ideas across the United States about what to do in this campaign. As in the great ideological battles of the past, most recently the cold war, America is looking to frame the struggle in its own terms. But as the broad appeal of the videotaped message by Osama bin Laden made clear, the Al Qaeda terrorist network of Mr. bin Laden is already seeking to set the terms of the debate to serve its own interests and turn the Islamic world against the United States.","1069":"I truly don't understand those who are opposed to the American military action in Afghanistan. People can argue back and forth about what Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda want, but actions speak louder than words.","1070":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates\u2014 Officials of the United Arab Emirates are examining the country's banking practices after government investigators said they believed that they were used by a paymaster for Osama bin Laden as a transfer point for bankrolling the hijackers who attacked the United States.","1071":"But while the United States has pursued Osama bin Laden and sought to neutralize the Taliban that shelters him, the behind-the-scenes effort to organize a leadership that would replace Taliban leaders has made no discernible progress.","1072":"During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the helicopter-borne troops of the 101st Airborne were among the first to go. This time, although the 101st Airborne is on alert, it has not received orders to deploy. Instead, smaller specialized units based at Fort Campbell, the Fifth Special Forces and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers, seem to be sending some of their highly trained soldiers in the search for Osama bin Laden.","1073":"'They are innocent people living here,' said one villager, Gul Mohammed. 'There is no military base. What is it they are looking for in Afghanistan? Where is Osama bin Laden? He is not here. Why did they bomb us?'","1074":"Kandahar in southern Afghanistan is the Taliban's spiritual stronghold, the place where they are expected to make their last stand, if it comes to that. It also was a home of Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the attacks that killed nearly 6,000 people in the United States last month.","1075":"Angie W. Sherry, a member who is a lawyer, said she had written to a local principal seeking help for another member whose son was enduring taunts from boys at his school that he looked 'like Osama' -- a reference to Osama bin Laden. Her letter, Ms. Sherry said, 'was to make the school aware of the harassment.'","1076":"Of the nearly 700 people arrested in the United States as part of the terrorism investigation, at least 10 were part of cells linked to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, senior law enforcement officials said.","1077":"In another move tied to the conflict in Afghanistan, Mr. Blair's office said today that it was calling in television executives this week for talks on their use of videotapes of Osama bin Laden and members of his network. The government expressed the same concern brought up by the Bush administration last week when it sought agreement from American networks for delaying or limiting transmission -- that the comments could contain coded messages to bin Laden operatives in other countries.","1078":"Instead of bombing targets in Afghanistan, these students suggest prosecuting Osama bin Laden and other terrorism suspects through an international war tribunal. They fault the United States sanctions against Iraq and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Western economic policies throughout the third world, for inciting anti-American hatred.","1079":"Who did it? The timing, and the continuing threats from Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, make that group an easy suspect. In an appearance on Friday on the PBS program, 'The News Hour with Jim Lehrer,' Vice President Dick Cheney noted that Mr. bin Laden's group trained its followers to use chemical and biological weapons. Implying a link between Mr. bin Laden and the anthrax incidents, he said, 'Again, we have not completed the investigation and maybe it's a coincidence, but I must say I'm a skeptic.'","1080":"AFTER THE TALIBAN -- One week after the bombs started falling on Afghanistan, the United States military campaign has run ahead of Washington's political strategy to install a new regime in Kabul. While United States has pursued Osama bin Laden and sought to neutralize the Taliban that shelters him, the behind-the-scenes effort to organize a regime that would replace Taliban leaders has made no discernible progress.

What rule of engagement has been given our special forces regarding Osama bin Laden and his top aides -- to kill or to capture? Do the potential benefits to us of interrogation outweigh the benefit to him of a trial's world forum and subsequent slaughter of hostages?","1083":"General Massoud was killed on Sept. 9 by two men posing as journalists. The men are believed to have ties to Osama bin Laden.","1084":"But the placid surroundings were shattered on Friday when Mr. Qadi found himself on a new list of 39 individuals and groups accused by the United States Treasury Department of financing Osama bin Laden and his organization, Al Qaeda.","1085":"Writing in a London-based Arabic daily on Saturday, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, Kuwait's former oil and information minister, criticized what he described as his country's lackluster support for the American-led campaign against Osama bin Laden and his associates. He blamed his government's policy of 'abdication' on Kuwait's militant Islamic groups and some of their charities, which he accused of having 'hijacked' the country's foreign policy.","1086":"General Musharraf has been walking a political tightrope since he sided with the United States in its war against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban and the terrorist network led by the Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan.","1087":"'Is it Al Qaeda?' Mr. Thompson asked, referring to the terrorist network run by Osama bin Laden. 'We don't know. It could be a domestic source. It could be somebody holding a grudge.'","1088":"When the White House suggested that five major United States television news organizations use caution before airing raw video statements from Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda followers last week, government officials said Mr. bin Laden's statements could include hidden messages to terrorists.","1089":"The program's format was numbingly familiar -- four suits shouting. But the language was Arabic, the subject was the morality of terror and the channel was Al Jazeera, the satellite channel that infuriated the White House last week by playing a tape of Osama bin Laden.","1090":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 14\u2014 President Bush forcefully rejected another offer from the Taliban today to begin talks about the surrender of Osama bin Laden if the United States stopped bombing Afghanistan.","1091":"There were no posters of Osama bin Laden or any overt references to the United States at the funeral. When asked about Mr. Bin Laden, Wajeeh Qawas, a Hamas leader who addressed the crowd by microphone from the back of a truck, condemned the terrorist attacks on the United States. 'Our people don't hate America, but they hate the unjust policies of America,' he said. 'And they look to Osama bin Laden not as an individual but as someone who is opposing U.S. policies.'","1092":"A BUSH REBUFF -- President Bush's offer last week to reconsider the bombing if the Taliban surrendered Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants brought about another exchange yesterday. The second-in-command of the Taliban, Maulvi Abdul Kabir, said Mr. bin Laden could be handed over to a third country if the United States showed evidence that he was responsible for terrorism.","1094":"On the military front, 10 days of bombing and missile attacks on Afghanistan appeared to be achieving their desired effect. A senior Taliban official surfaced in Pakistan appealing for a pause in the raids to allow moderate Taliban leaders to persuade Mullah Muhammad Omar, the hard-line supreme chief, to surrender Osama bin Laden.","1095":"Asked about reports that the United States was tying to bomb Mullah Omar, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld indicated today that the Taliban leadership, as well as Osama bin Laden, was a legitimate target.","1096":"In what appeared to be the first contact since the beginning of American attacks on Afghanistan between a reporter from an American news organization and representatives of the Al Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden, a CNN correspondent, Nic Robertson, reported yesterday that he had met with two men identifying themselves as representatives of the group.","1097":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 15\u2014 Federal authorities say they are now investigating the possibility that followers of Osama bin Laden were behind the anthrax cases around the nation.","1099":"President Bush was clearly alarmed that renewed armed conflict between India and Pakistan could rupture the delicately balanced coalition against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden.

He has made us re-emphasize what's important.'","1102":"NEW CASES -- The nation's anthrax scare widened as a new infection was reported in New York City and a letter containing the deadly substance was opened on Capitol Hill. President Bush said there may be a link to Osama bin Laden or his allies.

Loyalists to Osama bin Laden portray the bombing as an assault on Islam.","1104":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 15\u2014 At secret talks in Pakistan today, a senior Taliban leader appealed for an American bombing pause in Afghanistan while moderates in the Taliban government sought to persuade the supreme Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, to agree to a formula for the handover of Osama bin Laden, officials in Pakistan disclosed tonight.","1105":"I am disturbed to hear President Bush dismiss any discussion of Osama bin Laden's innocence or guilt, saying, 'We know he's guilty.'","1107":"Ms. Roth noted that the Pentagon has already said the first phase of the war is over, and that finding and bringing Osama bin Laden to justice 'does not require bombing.'","1108":"Like many pockets of poor Muslim immigrants, La Cit\u00e9 is a world unto itself, where young men are caught in a profound and disturbing identity crisis, suffer the sting of racism and the plague of unemployment. Some have come to see in Osama bin Laden, the man America is trying to bomb into submission, as a savior.","1109":"In Washington, top law enforcement and health officials until today played down possible links between the anthrax cases and Osama bin Laden's terror network. Then, as a new letter appeared in the office of the Senate majority leader, they abruptly acknowledged that such a link is now at the center of their investigation into who is behind the anthrax attacks.","1110":"To listen to Saudi officials, or read the Arab press, you would never know that most of the hijackers were young Saudis, or that the main financing for Osama bin Laden -- a Saudi -- has been coming from other wealthy Saudis, or that Saudi Arabia's government was the main funder of the Taliban. No, to listen to them you would think that all these young men had virgin births: they came from nowhere, no society is responsible for them, and no Arab state need reflect on how perpetrators of such a grotesque act could have come from its womb.","1111":"Mr. Arafat reiterated his condemnation of the attacks. In answer to a question as to why Osama bin Laden was wrong to have called on all Muslims to rise up in defense of the Palestinian cause, Mr. Arafat said: 'What I have said is very, very clear. Islam as a religion prevents anyone, forbids anyone to harm any civilians, any innocent people around the world.'","1112":"CNN has asked Osama bin Laden whether he or his followers have weapons of mass destruction and whether they plan to use them, the network said last night.","1113":"BRUSSELS, Oct. 16\u2014 American investigators say that the Belgian authorities have denied them access to suspects and evidence in their inquiry into the European network linked to Osama bin Laden and a thwarted plot to blow up the American Embassy in Paris.","1114":"General Musharraf deserves American support for his willingness to help in the campaign against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. That does not mean he should be given a free hand to support Islamic fundamentalist extremists in Kashmir, the northern Indian state where a Muslim uprising has been raging for years.

Now anthrax terrorism is forcing us to wear rubber gloves and surgical masks if we want to open our mail.","1118":"That having been said, the number of confirmed anthrax cases remained only four -- two in Florida and two in New York. Who is responsible for these attacks was still not clear, though government officials said again that they could not rule out a connection to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks believed to have been orchestrated by Osama bin Laden.","1119":"Leadership targets have been a principal focus. The United States has been making a determined effort to bomb Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme leader of the Taliban and an ally of the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. Many of the strikes have been concentrated in and around Kandahar, the Taliban's political base.","1120":"Nor is it clear whether Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network, was involved in any way. American intelligence officials say Mr. bin Laden has tried to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.","1121":"The official said the letters contained phrases like 'Death to America,' 'You're going to die' and 'Allah is great.' Investigators did not conclude that the reference to Allah meant that the letter writer was an Islamic extremist or linked to Osama bin Laden, the official said. But officials today refused to rule out any possible motive for the letters.","1122":"According to a federal indictment handed up in 1998, Osama bin Laden set up a headquarters for Al Qaeda in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, in 1991, together with numerous companies intended to 'provide income and support' for the terrorist network. The indictment also said Al Qaeda had forged alliances with the National Islamic Front, the ruling party in Sudan.","1123":"The agreement was the most visible achievement of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit here today as bombs continued to fall in Afghanistan on Taliban troop concentrations and on targets associated with Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden.","1124":"Last week, for example, the White House urged American television networks and newspapers to 'exercise judgment' and drastically curtail publishing or broadcasting 'propaganda,' including possibly 'coded messages,' from Osama bin Laden. Unspoken was the dangerous implication that the press was, perhaps unwittingly, playing into the enemy's hands. Within hours, fearing a public backlash, network executives promised more judicious editing in the future. None wanted to be seen as refusing to cooperate with the administration's crusade against terrorism.","1125":"Mr. Rumsfeld became the latest senior Bush administration official to grant an interview to Al Jazeera, the television network in Qatar, which has angered American officials by broadcasting tapes made by Osama bin Laden.","1126":"QUESTIONS FOR BIN LADEN: CNN announced that it had submitted six written questions to Osama bin Laden through a man who claimed to be a representative of Al Qaeda.

The first two deal with the dangerous work of firefighting, though Mr. Junger focuses on wildfires in the American West rather than the urban variety. The third (published in National Geographic Adventure last spring as a sort of prelude to the recently broadcast television program 'National Geographic Explorer') chronicles the author's travels with the anti-Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan a year or so ago, and contains a brief but compelling portrait of Gen. Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance's longtime military leader, who was assassinated last month by agents reportedly linked to Osama bin Laden.","1128":"In the case of Hitler, or Osama bin Laden, the line between explaining and excusing should be apparent to all. So the last thing we should want is to inhibit professors and teachers from exploring Islamic fundamentalism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the politics of oil, the role of authoritarianism in the Persian Gulf region, how American mass culture is marketed internationally or anything else that might help to understand and prevent recurring terrorism.","1129":"In assessing the military situation, Dr. Abdullah said the American airstrikes had killed hundreds of Taliban troops and rendered the Taliban incapable of beginning offensive military operations.

As a class, read and discuss the article \u201cU.S. Steps Up Leaflets and Radio Broadcasts to Sway Afghans,\u201d focusing on the following questions: a. What does this article refer to as \u2018Washington\u2019s latest weapon against the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan\u201d? b. How many leaflets were distributed on Sunday, October 14, 2001 in Afghanistan, and how were they distributed? c. According to the article, what do the United States-distributed leaflets look like, and what information do they contain? d. What were some messages the United States Department of Defense broadcast via radio to the people of Afghanistan? e. What is meant by the term \u201cpropaganda war\u201d? f. How do supporters of Osama bin Laden portray the bombing of Afghanistan, according to the article? g. What was United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s assessment of the current \u201cpropaganda war,\u201d according to the article? h. Who is Condoleeza Rice, and what did she do to address the topic of propaganda in the Arabic-speaking world? 3. Divide students into small groups. Explain to students that they will be searching for examples of the two categories of propaganda (\u201cbenefiting a cause\u201d and \u201cdamaging an opposing cause\u201d) presented in the print media since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Examples of propaganda should be from around the world (including the United States, as explored in this article), and should include both textual and visual examples (such as quotations, excerpts of speeches, and photographs). Students should use all available classroom resources provided and cut out examples as they find them. It will be important to help students keep in mind that this lesson is about propaganda and its functions, not about political perspectives or \u201csides.\u201d After about twenty minutes, give each group two pieces of poster board or construction paper and a glue stick, and have them create collages of their collected words and images. On one piece of paper, students should collage their items that represent \u201cbenefiting a cause.\u201d On the other, they should collage their items that represent \u201cdamaging an opposing cause.\u201d 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups complete their posters and post them in two areas of the classroom depending on the type of propaganda explored. At home, each student synthesizes her understanding of propaganda by writing a brief essay about the pros and cons of propaganda in wartime. Essays can be shared or posted in a future class.","1132":"The Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has embraced the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi and condemned Zionism, said President Bush should make public the evidence that Osama bin Laden was involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 'The nation would be more secure if you give the American people a reason to fight,' Mr. Farrakhan said.","1133":"President Bush was wrong not to negotiate with the Taliban over Osama bin Laden. If he has substantial evidence against Osama bin Laden, why not negotiate? Is this not a part of seeking justice? Or does Mr. Bush believe that striking Afghanistan and killing innocent people is O.K. in the name of foreign policy?","1134":"Mr. Putin has moved aggressively since Sept. 11 to help Washington. Among other things, he has encouraged former Soviet republics in Central Asia like Uzbekistan to open their bases to American troops and planes. In return Mr. Putin has tried to get Washington to mute criticism of Russia's handling of Chechnya, something Mr. Bush should resist. More reasonably, Moscow is pressing Washington to slow its haste to discard the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. If the two countries can cooperate so closely against Osama bin Laden, they should be able to work out ways to amend the treaty to permit reasonable limited missile defenses.","1135":"The Taliban request that the United States halt the bombings so that negotiations can take place to discuss a turnover of Osama bin Laden (front page, Oct. 16) is a clever ploy to allow him to escape from Afghanistan without fear of being a casualty of American firepower. And the Taliban obviously believe that after he escapes, the United States will no longer have reason to bomb their country.","1136":"Four convicted terrorists with ties to Osama bin Laden will be ordered to pay restitution to victims of the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa, a federal judge in Manhattan said yesterday. Lawyers put the figure at roughly $33 million.","1137":"It appeared once again today that American military planners were worried that bombing the Taliban front-line positions here, just 35 miles north of Kabul, would open the door for Northern Alliance forces to take the Afghan capital. Pakistan, a vital American ally in the campaign against Osama bin Laden's network in Afghanistan, is strongly opposed to any move on Kabul by the alliance.","1138":"The Taliban also gave refuge to Osama bin Laden when he had to leave Sudan, welcoming him as a comrade from the struggle against Soviet forces and as a Muslim hero.","1139":"President Bush has been seeking to reward Mr. Arafat for his statements repudiating Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on America and for lending some support to the American-led antiterror coalition.","1140":"It is an example that is made more troubling to Uzbeks because the Taliban and Osama bin Laden have supported the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a group of insurgents who have infiltrated the countryside during recent summers and vowed to overthrow President Islam A. Karimov. The movement has pledged to govern the republic under its strict interpretation of Islamic law.","1141":"Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said that Osama bin Laden, his commanders and the leaders of the Taliban are all legitimate targets for United States strikes as part of the recognized right of selfdefense (front page, Oct. 16). They became targets because of their dispatch and support of terrorists who killed so many of our civilians on Sept. 11 and have done so on other occasions.","1142":"A CALL FOR EVIDENCE: The Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, said the president should reveal the evidence against Osama bin Laden. B10","1143":"KOTA BHARU, Malaysia, Oct. 18\u2014 Sahimah sells Islamic books, tapes and head scarves from her sidewalk kiosk here. But pride of place is reserved for a new arrival: T-shirts emblazoned with Osama bin Laden's face and the phrase 'Man of the World,' available in adult and children's sizes.","1144":"Mr. Putin's decision to align Russia with the fight against the bases of Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been hailed as a significant turn in Russia's post-cold-war policy toward the West. It has secured one immediate benefit for Russia: greater Western acceptance of the military campaign Mr. Putin is waging in the rebellious territory of Chechnya.","1145":"Al-Jazeera is the satellite station out of Qatar that broadcasts, free of government restrictions, all over the Arab world, putting on such a range of statesmen that it has infuriated everyone. The outfit annoyed President Bush last week by playing a tape of Osama bin Laden.","1146":"THE CALL TO ACTION -- Special forces units expected to begin their search for Osama bin Laden soon are quietly leaving their families, with no fanfare and amid as much secrecy as possible. B3","1147":"The four men who were sentenced yesterday in the embassy bombings conspiracy were all followers of Osama bin Laden. One of the men, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was also a sworn member of Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist organization, while another, Wadih El-Hage, was a close aide and former personal secretary.","1148":"In an interview today with the Cable News Network, Mr. Rumsfeld was asked about concerns that America 'might leave the Taliban in place and make them and Osama bin Laden even bigger heroes.'","1149":"As the air attacks on Taliban targets in Afghanistan have presumably softened the Taliban's air defenses, commando units are widely expected to begin their search for Osama bin Laden soon, and some of them will come from Fort Campbell, which is better known as the home of the 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles.","1150":"When they saw it, they knew: the attack on the World Trade Center was the work of Osama bin Laden. The two women said they had good reason to believe this. After all, they had sat through five months of testimony about Mr. bin Laden and his terrorist group as jurors in the embassy bombings trial.","1151":"These anti-Western views aid Osama bin Laden or other extremists in finding recruits, some Saudis believe, because they can mold the imperfectly formed religious creed of young, easily influenced men, convincing them that their faith condones violence against non-Muslims. Even Saudi Arabia's famous oil wealth -- Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, earned $80 billion last year -- has been no insurance against economic and political unrest.","1152":"First, we need to eliminate the Osama bin Ladens, who are dedicated to using any sharp instrument to super-empower themselves to do us harm. We will not get the backing of our Arab allies by winning an argument with them about the necessity of this war. We will win their backing and respect if we win the war and uproot bin Laden and the Taliban.","1153":"In the same way that many Islamic extremist crusades use the oppression of women to help them gain control over wider populations, the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are now employing the tactics of terrorism to gain control.","1154":"Four terrorists who were convicted in May of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa were sentenced yesterday to life in prison without any chance of release.","1155":"But did his promise, in Quetta, of a 'secret' plan mean that there was some new formula that would send Osama bin Laden and his associates into American hands?","1156":"Four days after federal officials moved to freeze the assets of several honey businesses in Yemen, saying they were tied to Osama bin Laden, two men were arrested at Kennedy Airport on charges that they tried to smuggle more than $100,000 in cash to Yemen in boxes of honey.","1157":"Clearly Osama bin Laden wants it to be a clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. The first priority for our government is to try to prevent it from becoming one. But there is a real danger that it could move in that direction. The administration has acted exactly the right way in attempting to rally support among Muslim governments and people. But there are great pressures here in the United States to attack other terrorist groups and states that support terrorist groups. And that, it seems to me, could broaden it into a clash of civilizations.","1158":"Ahmed Rashid's 'Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia,' although redundantly subtitled, is my favorite reference on the Taliban movement. Richly detailed, the book grows out of Rashid's more than two decades of reporting from the region. No book provides as much insight into the Taliban movement's rise and success, including chapters on its religious ideology, organizational structure, heroin economy, policies toward women and shadowy support for Osama bin Laden and the 'Arab Afghans.'","1159":"I am unsure why you insist that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel 'exercise restraint' when it comes to retaliation against Palestinian terrorism. No such demand is made of President Bush, who is exercising little to no restraint in his response to Osama bin Laden's terrorism. Why are these two strikingly parallel cases being treated so differently?","1160":"Last month, American officials said they had received an unconfirmed report that Mr. Atta met with an Iraqi official last year. If that is found to be true, Iraq could be seen to have a role in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Some American officials would like to expand the assault on Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to include Iraq.","1161":"That version is called Wahhabism, although the Saudis are loath to use the term in referring to their proselytizing in this country. As practiced in Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism denies equal rights to women, and its teachings have inspired the violent extremism of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government that harbors him in Afghanistan.","1162":"Other government agencies have sent to banks lists of individuals and organizations with financial ties to Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden. The government has demanded that the financial institutions freeze the accounts of any name on those lists.","1163":"Mr. Midhar has become a major focus of the terror investigation because investigators suspect he also had roles in two previous acts of terrorism tied to Osama bin Laden, the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies and the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole.","1164":"Photo: Fresh off a Brazilian assembly line, masks of Osama bin Laden rest on a table at a factory in a suburb of Rio de Janeiro yesterday. In the background are dozens more masks of Yasir Arafat and President Bush. (Renzo Gostoli/Associated Press)","1165":"Some 15 young people in Ede made the national news when they were seen celebrating in the streets while making a V-sign for victory and calling Osama bin Laden 'our leader.' Teachers in some schools with primarily foreign students declared they did not observe the three minutes of silence in honor of victims.","1167":"'Attention, people of Afghanistan,' blared one warning, which was made public by the Pentagon. 'United States forces will be moving through your area. We are not here to harm you. We are here for Osama bin Laden and those that protect them! Please, for your own safety, stay off bridges and roadways and do not interfere with our troops or military operations.'","1168":"The anthrax scare has so dominated Americans' consciousness that it was almost possible for a while to overlook the war in Afghanistan. But the harsh reality of combat returned in a rush with the start of American ground operations in and around Kandahar, a city in southern Afghanistan where the Taliban rulers and Osama bin Laden's terrorist network are strongest.","1169":"The consensus among those leaders was that even widespread defections would not eliminate the need to send troops to Afghanistan to wipe out resistance and hunt Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda members.","1170":"While there is no proof that Mr. Ortega ever met him, one televised spot also shows Osama bin Laden among the rogues' gallery, while an announcer warns people, 'If they could vote in Nicaragua, they would vote for Daniel Ortega.'","1171":"It may be that Osama bin Laden's network and many others are built on similar principles. What if the network is designed so that if Mr. bin Laden were removed, the network would proceed unimpeded? What if the network is less hierarchical than it seems, so there are few if any agents with a complete overview of what is happening? Some people in intelligence have theorized that this was the case with some of the hijackers. How is this kind of network, a modified human version of the Internet, to be undermined, particularly given its intermeshing links with other terror networks with their own design?","1172":"Winning the military struggle against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban protectors, if and when we do, will not end the threat of terrorism against the United States. That will require, in the long run, something more difficult than military action: a profound effort by America and the West to ease the poverty and misery of the developing world.","1173":"The goals seem clear. The Pentagon is initially looking to destabilize and topple the Taliban leadership, first by bombing, now by pursuing individual leaders. The bigger target is Osama bin Laden and his followers. If Washington can get reliable intelligence about the movement of the terrorist leader -- information that is hard to acquire -- special forces may eventually be able to track him down.","1174":"Perhaps history will see the ultimate tragedy in what is happening today, with the arrival of Arab zealots, Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants. Their dominating presence in the Taliban's Afghanistan has brought down on Afhan heads an homes an American war, whose potential ripples could directly affect every land between the Mediterranean and the Ganges. Unhappily this time, Afghanistan again finds itself at the center of the world.","1175":"Osama bin Laden specifically invoked past Israeli attacks on Beit Jala, Jenin and Ramallah in his videotaped appeal for Muslim support broadcast on Oct. 7. The Israelis today occupied positions in Palestinian-controlled territory in two more West Bank cities, Qalqiliya and Tul Karm. Four Palestinians were killed in fighting in those two cities and four more were killed in fighting in the Bethlehem area.","1178":"Andrew Tyndall, who tracks the major networks' evening news programs, calculated that these programs, the showcases of the news departments of ABC, NBC and CBS, devoted a combined total of 84 minutes to the anthrax mailings between Oct. 15 and Oct. 18. Of all the aspects of the terrorism coverage, including the American bombing campaign in Afghanistan and the search for Osama bin Laden, only the initial coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks consumed more weekly broadcast time than did the combined evening news coverage of the anthrax scares last week. (A combined 333 minutes were devoted to the attacks on the three broadcasts in the week of Sept. 10.)","1179":"Senior government officials say they believe they have captured at least 10 members of Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, who may have been involved in cells planning other attacks. While there is no firm evidence of specific plots that have been thwarted, one senior law enforcement official said, 'We know we've changed the atmosphere.'","1180":"Sikhs are not Muslim. Indeed, through history they have often battled Muslim empires, but to confused Americans they resemble Osama bin Laden, and late one September night that is what a half-dozen thugs in East New York, Brooklyn, screamed at Parwinder Singh, smashing three windows in his taxi with beer bottles. After that, the mother said Parwinder must stop working. For days he stayed indoors, but it made him feel fearful and hopeless. He saw only one way out. He would wake one morning, ready to do it. Then, the next morning he could not; his father would feel disgraced, and the young man had been raised to respect his father like a god.","1181":"And while you're at it, picture Osama bin Laden in his boxers.","1182":"The crowd cheered as Jon Bon Jovi sang 'Dead Or Alive,' one of his hit songs from the 1980's and a phrase that President Bush has used in reference to the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attack, Osama bin Laden. Mick Jagger used a vulgar term to explain why it was best not to get into a fight with New York.","1183":"Most of the monks support the bombing in Afghanistan, Father Conner said, not as revenge, but as a way of capturing Osama bin Laden. 'You're allowed to pursue war if it's truly for the sake of self-defense,' he said.","1185":"As a postmodernist, I have had a very hard time dealing with life in New York City over the last month. I see flags everywhere and pictures of Osama bin Laden with his face shown in the cross hairs. I fear that if I speak up, I will be branded a traitor.","1186":"Persico has been over this ground before, notably in 'Piercing the Reich,' his history of an aggressive campaign by the Office of Strategic Services to put secret agents into Nazi-controlled territory in the last year of the war, and in his biography of William Casey, President Ronald Reagan's choice to run the Central Intelligence Agency. There Casey demonstrated the last flowering of the spirit he had learned at the knee of William Donovan, founder of the O.S.S., who would have been challenged to organize a dinner for four but ran a secret intelligence service willing to hazard any scheme, however harebrained it appeared to cooler eyes. What Casey gave Reagan was the Iran-contra scandal and an American-supported full-scale guerrilla war against Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The result was a Soviet retreat in 1989 followed, to our current sorrow, by the rise of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1187":"Q. And on Osama bin Laden?","1188":"So, too, have American support for Israel and for sanctions on Iraq, and the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. As a result, the message of the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden has gained a broad resonance.","1189":"Stanley Fish offers an interesting explanation of moral relativism ('Condemnation Without Absolutes,' Op-Ed, Oct. 15), but no major evildoer -- Pol Pot, Hitler, Jim Jones, Timothy McVeigh and now Osama bin Laden, if you like -- is a moral relativist who acknowledges that his own truth might not be more valid that other people's truths.","1190":"In turn, the Bush administration has refrained from criticizing Saudi silence over the American-led counterattacks against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, nor has it spoken out about evidence that Saudi citizens finance Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and other radical Islamic organizations.","1191":"That code and kinship explain much of what is happening in this conflict, such as why the Taliban are reluctant to evict their guest, Osama bin Laden, who has asked them for a sanctuary they are honor-bound to give, and why even those Pakistanis who are not religious militants have joined in heated protests.","1192":"11 1 THE NEW JACKALS, by Simon Reeve. (Northeastern University, $26.95.) Tracking the career of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and his links to Osama bin Laden.","1193":"One aim of the American campaign is to topple the Taliban government and another, the primary objective, is to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his top associates in Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization.","1194":"LONDON, Oct. 20\u2014 More than a month after the September terror attacks, the United States and its close allies are still intercepting communications among Osama bin Laden's associates and are convinced more attacks are coming, intelligence officials in several countries say.","1195":"At the B. Dalton bookstore in The Westchester mall, the display racks near the checkout counter are lined with books on germ warfare, Osama bin Laden and the New York City skyline. Next to a 'Halloween Hits' CD is the paperback version of 'The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook.'","1196":"Though virtually all the world's countries proclaimed support for the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, the bombing campaign to pry Osama bin Laden out of Afghanistan has touched an anti-American nerve across the Islamic world, providing new ammunition for radical groups from Pakistan to Indonesia. In the Middle East, Arab states with potent radical Islamic movements, like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, become more anxious every day the bombing continues.","1197":"Four terrorists convicted last spring of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa were sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan to life in prison without any chance of release. Two -- Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, who assisted in the bombing in Kenya, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 28, who helped in preparing the attack in Tanzania -- had earlier avoided the death penalty when the jury did not unanimously vote for execution. The two others were Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 41.","1198":"President Bush, in his demand that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden, said on Oct. 14 that 'we know he's guilty.' But Mr. Bush and other officials have suggested that they would place Mr. bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders on trial if they were captured alive.","1199":"THE ROAD TO KABUL -- The roar of the first wave of jets far overhead at 5 p.m. Afghan time yesterday was music to the ears of the Northern Alliance forces who have been held in the northeastern corner of the country by the Taliban and by Arab and Pakistani volunteers, including some forces loyal to Osama bin Laden.","1200":"The tug of war between moderation and extremism is evident in the Petronas Towers themselves. Someone has scribbled 'long live Osama bin Laden' on the wall of the one of its gleaming elevators.","1201":"However, I would hate to place my trust in Osama bin Laden and his friends to bring peace and prosperity to the Persian Gulf based on what the Taliban have brought to Afghanistan. Just ask the Afghan women!","1202":"More broadly, American officials admit that they have poor intelligence about the makeup and operations of Afghanistan's drug trafficking organizations and know even less about how those groups might be linked to Osama bin Laden or other suspected terrorists.","1203":"Legal experts are beginning to ask fundamental questions: If Osama bin Laden and his supporters are caught, will they be tried? And if so, where and how?

Osama T-shirts and chocolates wrapped in his bearded face are popular, too.","1208":"President Bush has said he is determined to carry on the search for Osama bin Laden and efforts to topple the Taliban leadership that shelters him even if takes a year or more. But the harsh Afghan winter will hamper American and British ground actions in Afghanistan.","1209":"A DIFFERENT VIEW -- The American campaign to capture or kill Osama bin Laden has elevated his stature among many Pakistanis, who now regard him as a hero.

The cover of U.S. News featured a photograph of Mr. bin Laden's face in a gun's cross hairs, and Newsweek altered Mr. bin Laden's photo to look like an infrared image.","1217":"In the next day's strip, Huey tried to convince the F.B.I., pointing out that in the administration of Ronald Reagan the C.I.A. trained Osama bin Laden and other Afghan rebels to fight the Soviet Union. The strip then suggests that the current Bush administration has also given financial support to the Taliban government.","1219":"I'm writing you both urgently because I fear your conflict is deteriorating so far and fast that it's going to undermine my ability to sustain the war against Osama bin Laden.","1220":"IN OUR MIDST -- In 1995, when American intelligence officials beganto pay attention to Osama bin Laden, one of his topcommanders slipped into the United States for a coast-to-coast fund-raising tour.

American jets circled overhead five hours later but dropped no bombs, they added.","1224":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 22\u2014 Germany is trying to determine if followers of Osama bin Laden are still be operating within its borders and could strike again, the German interior minister said today.","1225":"For all the screening and the rush to secure more Cipro, the genesis of the bacteria remained a mystery, at least to the public. The government was still unable to say whether there was any connection to Osama bin Laden and his terror network. The lack of anything more tangible seemed to render the outbreak all the more fearsome -- a scourge that seemed to have no identifiable motive or source to combat.","1226":"I'm writing you both urgently because I fear your conflict is deteriorating so far and fast that it's going to undermine my ability to sustain the war against Osama bin Laden.","1227":"Although General Musharraf's military government has disavowed Harkat ul-Mujahedeen and closed its offices in Pakistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because of its longstanding links to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, Pakistan is wary of being seen to have supported a bombing attack on the group, not only because many of the casualties appeared to have been Pakistanis.","1228":"Federal prosecutors say members of Mr. Kaplan's group had contacts with Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, in 1996 and 1997, but that they have no evidence of more recent contact.","1229":"But interviews with Muslim worshipers, religious leaders and others here, make clear that he has failed to convince many British Muslims either that Osama bin Laden was behind the Sept. 11 attacks or that the war on the Taliban is justified.","1230":"As he stepped out of a Pakistani-owned grocery on Fifth Avenue, three men approached him.

Not while the fabulous Jimmy D was spinning the platters.","1238":"Not that American commanders or their closest allies, the British, ever thought that the war would be conducted without such mistakes or without peril to allied forces. Unavoidable risks come with the use of ground troops, who saw their first real action last Friday, a pinprick raid in and around Kandahar. That was well and good, said Britain's top military officer, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce. But to ferret out Osama bin Laden and destroy his terrorist network, the admiral said, it may be necessary to send ground forces into Afghanistan not for just a few hours but for days and even weeks at a time.","1239":"Such buck-passing won't work. With logic, followers of Osama bin Laden will say, 'By killing thousands of Americans, we got the U.S. to put pressure on Israel.

At least three speakers said Osama bin Laden, accused by Washington in the Sept. 11 attacks, was a hero of the jihad and should remain Afghanistan's guest.","1243":"In the dark days after Taliban forces swept across northern Afghanistan in 1996, General Massoud decided that his salvation lay in smaller, better-trained and highly mobile infantry units. The general, who was attacked on Sept. 9 by two men thought to have ties to Osama bin Laden and who died several days later, dreamed of 20,000 well-equipped soldiers who could strike quickly and effectively in coordinated attacks.","1244":"No one, not even their relatives, should show terrorists sympathy, the prince said, adding: 'The body has diseases and some organ could be diseased. So the diseased organ must be removed.' Osama bin Laden was born a Saudi but the ruling family stripped him of his passport in 1994.","1245":"Federal authorities moved quickly to transfer four convicted followers of Osama bin Laden to a high-security prison in Pennsylvania after they were sentenced last week in the embassy bombings trial.","1246":"Of course, all this could change quickly. A major mistake in bombing, the loss of a large number of American ground troops, a failure to find Taliban leaders or Osama bin Laden could all turn public opinion.","1247":"Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the lead federal prosecutor in the recent embassy bombings trial in Manhattan, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate as the United States attorney in Chicago. A Harvard Law School graduate, Mr. Fitzgerald joined the United States attorney's office in Manhattan in 1988. He was co-chief of the terrorism unit and helped supervise that office's investigation of Osama bin Laden, who is now suspected of masterminding the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","1248":"So Ms. Khan's identity was in flux, even before the events of Sept. 11 transformed her from a citified, New Age Muslim who shopped at Ikea, skated in Central Park and made profitable use of her law degree as a project-finance associate at Chadbourne &amp; Park, to an angrily articulate advocate intent on disproving any link between Islam and the fugitive who dominates her nightmares, Osama bin Laden.","1249":"Mr. Ressam seems a much more revealing figure today. Just three months ago he testified in Federal District Court in Manhattan against another conspirator, telling of his own time in one of Osama bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. He was trained in the use of weapons and explosives bought from the Taliban, he said, and was taught to sabotage 'the infrastructure of a country' by attacking 'electric plants, gas plants, airports, railroads, large corporations and military installations.'","1250":"Most recently, Ms. White's office prosecuted four followers of Osama bin Laden on charges that they conspired in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people.","1251":"LONDON, Oct. 24\u2014 With combat in Afghanistan moving from exclusive reliance on airstrikes to complex commando operations, Britain's top military officer said today that ground troops may have to operate in Afghanistan for weeks at a time if they are to ferret out Osama bin Laden and destroy his terrorist network.","1253":"In an indirect reference to Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorist network, the resolution said 'foreigners,' meaning the Arab militants who predominate in Al Qaeda, should no longer 'exploit the hospitality of Afghans and should leave the country.'","1255":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 25\u2014 The Saudi family of Osama bin Laden is severing its financial ties with the Carlyle Group, a private investment firm known for its connections to influential Washington political figures, executives who have been briefed on the decision said today.","1256":"Mr. Rumsfeld also changed his assessment of the likelihood that the United States would capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the head of the terrorist network Al Qaeda.","1257":"Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has worked for years on money-laundering legislation, said, 'Osama bin Laden has boasted that his modern, new recruits know the, in his words, cracks in Western financial systems like they know the lines in their own hands.'","1258":"THE TALIBAN'S ENDURANCE -- If that sounded less than reassuring, so did the war news. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told USA Today that he was not sure the United States would be able to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. As for Mr. bin Laden's Taliban protectors, their fighters were proving to be more determined than expected, American military commanders acknowledged.","1259":"It also threatens to undermine Israeli relations with Washington. The new eruption of violence in the Mideast is not helpful to America's effort to hold together a fragile coalition of nations in the battle against Osama bin Laden and international terrorism. Despite a personal plea from President Bush to withdraw Israeli troops, Mr. Sharon continues these military operations, the broadest in the West Bank in nearly a decade. That ill serves the long-term interests of both Israel and the United States.","1260":"The Saudi ruling family would love to cooperate by handing over its police files on the 15 Saudis involved in the hijackings, but that would be a violation of its sovereignty, and, well, you know how much the Saudis respect sovereignty -- like when the Saudi Embassy in Washington rushed all of Osama bin Laden's relatives out of America after Sept. 11 on a private Saudi jet, before they could be properly questioned by the F.B.I.","1261":"The Saudi ruling family would love to cooperate by handing over its police files on the 15 Saudis involved in the hijackings, but that would be a violation of its sovereignty, and, well, you know how much the Saudis respect sovereignty -- like when the Saudi Embassy in Washington rushed all of Osama bin Laden's relatives out of America after Sept. 11 on a private Saudi jet, before they could be properly questioned by the F.B.I.","1262":"A recent overhaul of banking rules has persuaded foreign governments to remove Panama from the list, in time to assure American officials that no accounts linked to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network have been found here. Officials continue to investigate several suspicious corporations, but have yet to find anything illegal.","1263":"Further Questions for Discussion:\u2013Do you think that publishers are \u201cusing\u201d the terrorist attacks and the related tragic events as a way to make more money, or that they are simply providing readers with books that interest them? \u2013What book topics do you think are always popular, and why? \u2013Do you think the quality of a book is related to how many copies it sells? Why or why not? \u2013Would you want to read a book about Osama bin Laden or the Taliban? Why or why not? \u2013It is often said that \u201cart mimics life.\u201d What do you think this means? Do you think this is true for books? Why or why not?","1264":"NO RESPONSE -- More than a week after submitting lists of questions to Osama bin Laden, neither CNN nor the Arabic-language news network Al Jazeera has received a response. B4","1265":"After three weeks of American bombing runs, the limits of air power are evident in Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden remains in hiding and the Taliban have not crumbled. In a costly mistake yesterday, a Red Cross warehouse was accidentally bombed again. Word also came that an important opposition leader whom Washington had looked to as a potential rallying point for dissident Pashtuns had been captured and executed by Taliban forces.","1266":"Britain's announcement means that the United States' closest ally is prepared to share the risks of ground operations to search for Osama bin Laden and Taliban leaders, a politically significant step as the Bush administration tries to maintain public support for the complex operation.","1267":"The coalition supporting the military campaign against Osama bin Laden is united to combat terrorism, but there is no such consensus on other issues. Championing the rights of Afghan women works well with a domestic audience, but Bush officials caution against raising it too loudly abroad.","1268":"He said the best chance America had of achieving its primary goal -- capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and uprooting his Qaeda terrorist network -- rested with Pakistani-backed efforts to create a successor government that would include 'moderate' elements of the Taliban.","1269":"But after weeks of speculation and conflicting reports about Iraqi contacts with a cell leader who plotted the attacks, today's confirmation raises fresh questions about whether Iraq's foreign intelligence arm in recent years established secret ties with Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization.","1270":"A front-page article on Oct. 11 about a discussion between the White House national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and executives of the five major television networks about the presentation of videotapes of Osama bin Laden mischaracterized an outcome of the talks. The executives agreed to consider editing such tapes to remove language that might incite violence against Americans, but not to do so automatically. They said they would determine what to exclude, not the government.","1271":"Their children do not march on university campuses shouting anti-American slogans or profess admiration for religious extremists like Osama bin Laden, who has divided the world into good Muslims and bad infidels. Their children are sent abroad to study, in the United States and Europe, and return to take their place among the country's elite.","1272":"All that remained was the signal from Osama bin Laden's operatives in Afghanistan to strike. The nod was to come from a Frenchman of Algerian origin who was on his way back from training in Afghanistan.","1274":"PATERSON\u2014 AN off-duty fireman wandered into the Paterson New Market Street Rod and Gun Club and requested four copies of Osama bin Laden.","1275":"Ms. Coyle notes that terrorists like Osama bin Laden had begun using capitalism's own tools to attack it. She mentions that he and his allies were believed to be using encrypted pornography sites at one point to exchange information in planning attacks. And in one chillingly prescient passage, she anticipates the skill of people like Mr. bin Laden in psychological warfare through the use of the Internet and modern media.","1276":"It is the vision that has helped shape the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1277":"Yet antiwar activists say that negotiations and diplomacy should never be ruled out the way President Bush has rebuffed offers by the Taliban to have Osama bin Laden tried outside the United States.","1278":"ISRAEL today is not the Israel of 1991. The intervening years have seen the rise of a great hope and its collapse, and Israelis perceive the past 14 months as a full-blown war with the Palestinians. Discussion in Israel these days is whether Yasir Arafat is more like Osama bin Laden or the Taliban -- whether he is a direct perpetrator of terror, or a facilitator. So many Israelis cannot understand why Washington continues trying to restart negotiations, or why it keeps honking 'not helpful' when Israel uses what few levers it has to put pressure on Mr. Arafat, whether assassinations, air strikes or incursions into Palestinian territory.","1279":"Then Sept. 11 struck and in a reversal of the familiar adage, all politics became global. Westchester residents suddenly wanted to know more about Osama bin Laden than about county tax cuts. The campaigns of both Mr. Spano, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Horowitz, the Republican, came to a halt.","1280":"Neither child voiced fear or seemed frightened. But my son bubbled with questions -- about flying, the attacks, 'that guy Omana.' He liked the sky marshal idea. ('A policeman? That's good,' he said.) My daughter asked if the National Guard looked like Buckingham Palace guards. We decided to fly. We left on Oct. 6, a day before the start of retaliatory American airstrikes against Afghanistan, and returned on Oct. 14, the day a Kuwaiti spokesman for Osama bin Laden threatened to kill more Westerners. Our flights and our kids were fine.","1281":"Nonetheless, the first reality of this odd moment is that all three are more threatened by instability than they are by each other. There is the new threat of terrorists like Osama bin Laden who act outside the structure of any state, the old threat of regional chaos in Afghanistan, and concern about the potential for radical Islamic uprisings in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia.","1282":"According to the Pentagon, the Taliban's air force is no more. Taliban command centers have been pulverized. Barracks and ammunition dumps have been blasted and many channels of communication sundered. Major terrorist traning camps linked to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, which were abandoned at the start of the military campaign, have been leveled.","1283":"It was little more than a week ago that the Pentagon proclaimed that Taliban forces in Afghanistan had been 'eviscerated' by American airstrikes. The United States owned the Afghan skies, it was said. The Taliban air force was no more. Command centers were turned to dust. Abandoned training camps once run by Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, had been leveled.","1284":"CAMDEN\u2014 IF Osama bin Laden were captured tomorrow and brought to America for trial, Eddie Jacobs Jr. would be glad to defend him.","1285":"Pace Law School, which opened in 1975, has a history of being a liberal, progressive institution. One of its graduates, Stanley L. Cohen, a Port Chester native who works in Manhattan, is a radical lawyer who has defended terrorism suspects and has said he would consider representing Osama bin Laden. In the mid-1990's, Mr. Cohen defended Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, leader of the political wing of the militant Palestinian group Hamas. He recently defended Moataz Al-Hallak, who was questioned by law enforcement officials last month in connection with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and then released.","1286":"Agents made the requests for the intercepts barely minutes after the planes crashed into the World Trade Center, knowing from past terrorist acts that Osama bin Laden's followers often phoned to congratulate one another after successful operations.","1287":"And yet what is true here is true, in varying degrees, throughout the country: there is much I don't know about Osama bin Laden, but there is something he doesn't know about me, and you, and the rest of us. He doesn't know what a disparate culture we live in, how constantly at odds with itself it is. One paradox of our country is that the society that looks like such a monolith from without, looks, from within, so fragmented.","1288":"POLICE WORK -- Law enforcement officials across Europe said a plot to bomb the American embassy in Paris that was foiled late last month gave them a glimpse of how Osama bin Laden has operated in their midst and offered clues about how future plots might unfold. B1","1289":"Among them are the so-called Arab brigades, the military nexus between the Taliban government and Al Qaeda, a foreign legion assembled by Osama bin Laden, himself a Saudi who fought with the mujahedeen. 'Very ideologically motivated,' as the intelligence officer described these forces, they 'bring a different kind of fighting to the front than is experienced in a very long time. They give no quarter. They expect no quarter. They defend areas where traditional Taliban troops would, you know, pull back and hope for another day.'","1290":"Necrophiliac fervor at first seemed confined to Shiites (not just Iranians but the Lebanese factions that drove vehicles laden with explosives into the American Embassy and marine headquarters in Beirut in 1983). How suicide bombing then got adopted as a weapon by the Sunni Muslims of Palestine and the Arabian Peninsula -- and then by a multinational consortium drawing in Egyptians, Algerians, Moroccans and Kenyans that found its prime targets on American soil -- is a tangled question for scholars. All that happened when we were looking the other way. We ticked off the bombings but didn't pay close attention when, three years ago, Osama bin Laden declared 'war' on the United States. Other things -- like a White House sex scandal and the Nasdaq -- preoccupied us when he called us 'the most filthy sort of human beings' and a 'lowly people.' It didn't register when he said it was a sacred duty for Muslims to kill American civilians or praised young bombers for giving their lives to this 'killing and neck smiting.' And beyond the caves of Afghanistan, few seemed to be listening anyhow -- as far as we knew or cared.","1291":"Necrophiliac fervor at first seemed confined to Shiites (not just Iranians but the Lebanese factions that drove vehicles laden with explosives into the American Embassy and marine headquarters in Beirut in 1983).

But the situation became more complicated after terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Almost immediately, the United States began eyeing Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden.","1294":"At any other time, I might have read and then dismissed the efforts of the Bush administration to hone a perfect speech as just another example of manipulative president-packaging (D.T. Max, Oct. 7). However, given its juxtaposition to the image of Osama bin Laden, microphone in hand, delivering exaltations and threats as adroitly as a seasoned field correspondent filing an exclusive battlefield report, I am now a shameless booster of the administration's efforts. I have an uneasy feeling that bin Laden is the best-packaged man on the planet.","1295":"This time, it seemed, his half brother Osama bin Laden might have finally shattered the family's reputation, especially for those members who lived in the United States.","1296":"Because the Internet enables the immediate, worldwide distribution of digitized content, it has become a locus for Sept. 11-related material. To date the creative endeavors seen online have mostly been photographic or video documentaries or savage animations targeted at Osama bin Laden that might be thought of as high-tech folk art. Eventually, more digital artists are expected to weigh in with their visual interpretations of current events, as they have in the past.","1297":"The couples traded stories, like the one about two Americans whose car broke down on a stretch of desert highway. They were immediately wary of two Saudi men who stopped to offer help. Sensing their unease, one Saudi turned to the Americans and said, 'By the way, we hate Osama bin Laden.'","1298":"Among them are the West's insistence on branding Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network as Muslim fanatics, rather than simply as terrorists, and the willingness of the United States to bomb Afghanistan before producing conclusive proof of Mr. bin Laden's guilt. There is also a lingering distrust of Western powers, whose intervention, many readers think, may provide a temporary solution but lays the groundwork for fresh political squabbles.","1300":"For all their talk of terror and tactics, though, the men on the tapes were neither associates of Osama bin Laden nor members of his Al Qaeda terror network. Investigators say they have no evidence that these men were involved with the Sept. 11 hijackers or were part of recently disclosed plots to attack American Embassies in Paris and Rome.","1301":"Away from the job there have also been unexpected reminders of anti-American animosity, he said. The soccer team at the school that Mr. Shirts's 16-year-old son attends wanted to change its name to Osama bin Laden, but was overruled by the school's administration.","1302":"For Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the issue is particularly delicate. A general who seized power, he reversed policies to back the American campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government sheltering him, and is now under tremendous pressure from Islamic militants.","1303":"Find out if Osama bin Laden watches 'Friends.'

A1","1305":"Now the enemy is Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network. Gen. Peter Pace of the Marines, the vice chairman of the joint chiefs, observed yesterday's coin toss at midfield, but most government leaders were much too busy to stop by the box of the current owner, Daniel Snyder.","1306":"Those who blamed Islamic militants said it was not just the beards of the attackers, at least one of them said to have been long and straggly, just like Osama bin Laden's, just like those worn as a kind of banner of defiance by Islamic extremists who have branded their hatred for all things they associate with the Western world, especially America, and especially Christians and Jews, into the life of Pakistan.","1307":"Ms. Clement says the morbid humor here has kept her and her two children upbeat in the wake of the tragedy of Sept. 11. She finds it empowering to chuckle at Halloween masks of Osama bin Laden being sold on busy street corners, or to howl out loud at the jokes sent to her by e-mail. She is proud of her 10-year-old daughter's choice of anthrax as a topic for a paper. And she raved about her son's classmate who showed up at a Halloween party disguised as one of the Twin Towers.","1308":"Somebody put up a poster in Christopher Purdy's office in Jakarta showing Osama bin Laden with features of the comic character Mr. Bean. The caption read, 'Osama Bean Laden.'","1309":"American officials have said that its members have trained in Afghan camps, some controlled by Osama bin Laden, accused of organizing the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and that the group is based in northern Afghanistan. For its part, the American government has added the group to its list of terrorist organizations.","1310":"It is becoming increasingly clear that the loose coalition of northern minority groups fighting the Taliban has its own problems, as it appears increasingly to be a largely ineffective political and military force. It is clearly reeling from the assassination last month of the charismatic military leader Ahmed Shah Massoud. The assassination, carried out by two men said to have ties to Osama bin Laden, appears to have nearly paralyzed the alliance.","1311":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28\u2014 The intelligence service of Pakistan, a crucial American ally in the war on terrorism, has had an indirect but longstanding relationship with Al Qaeda, turning a blind eye for years to the growing ties between Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, according to American officials.","1312":"'As a hiker, I know that if people are willing to be completely rural, to live under trees and hide in caves, they are impervious to the kind of wars we fight,' he said. 'I think the war against Osama bin Laden is hopeless, but I also think we have no choice but to fight it.'","1313":"With the terror crisis now seven weeks old, though, there were signs that the nation, even if wiser, was not prepared to be patient forever. A New York Times/CBS News poll, taken before the latest warning, showed that the public still overwhelmingly supported President Bush, giving him an 87 percent job approval rating. But more than half said federal and local governments had not done enough to prepare for a biological attack, and nearly half of the respondents said the government was withholding information about the anthrax cases. Only 28 percent said they were 'very confident' that Osama bin Laden would be captured or killed.","1314":"STRANGE BEDFELLOWS -- A top C.I.A. official secretly traveled to Damascus this month to talk to Syrian intelligence officials about helping the United States investigate Osama bin Laden's terror network, American officials said.

Rumsfeld said today.","1317":"Well, on Sept. 11 we learned just how wrong that view was. What we didn't know hurt us very badly. On Sept. 11 we learned all the things about Saudi Arabia that we didn't know: that Saudi Arabia was the primary funder of the Taliban, that 15 of the hijackers were disgruntled young Saudis and that Saudi Arabia was allowing fund-raising for Osama bin Laden -- as long as he didn't use the money to attack the Saudi regime.","1318":"The leader of that terrorist plot, Jamal Beghal, told French intelligence officals that he trained in Afganistan and that before leaving that country for France, he met with an associate of Osama bin Laden. The plan was for a suicide bomber to drive a minivan full of explosives through the embassy gates.","1319":"Americans for the first time are raising doubts about whether the nation can accomplish its objectives in fighting terrorism at home and abroad, including capturing or killing Osama bin Laden, saving the international alliance from unraveling and protecting people from future attacks, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows.","1320":"Your Oct. 27 editorial headline was right: the war has just begun. We have to be in this effort for the long haul. There should be no quarter given to Osama bin Laden and his network of supporters, even to make a gesture to Muslims worldwide. If we succumb to pressure to have a pause for Ramadan, it will be doubly hard to restart the air campaign.","1321":"All sorts of unknowns loom that could thwart OPEC's plans. Oil demand has fallen substantially as the global economy has slumped. But some analysts said the group risks cutting too deeply just as heating oil demand picks up. The course of the American retaliation against Osama bin Laden could also jar the world economy again, and if it expands to include Iraq, oil production in the Persian Gulf could be thrown into disarray.","1322":"The novelist Dacia Maraini wrote that 'if you turn this into the first move of a holy war, you are helping him,' meaning Osama bin Laden, adding, 'It is a trap, Oriana, in which you seem to have fallen, spurred on by the impetuousness and the courage -- a little quixotic in this case -- that characterize you.'","1323":"Since the crisis began, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who recently voiced doubts that the United States would be able to kill or capture Osama bin Laden and later had to explain himself, has made more gaffes. But because of his rank and his rumpled, straightforward manner, he gets better performance reviews from reporters than Mr. Fleischer, whose smooth, studied replies can come off as unctuous. Perhaps to telegraph calm or good humor, Mr. Fleischer smiles regularly, but especially these days, his smile flashes, somewhat disconcertingly, even during sober pronouncements about spores, mail slitters and Cipro.","1324":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 29\u2014 A top C.I.A. official secretly traveled to Damascus this month to talk to Syrian intelligence officials about helping the United States investigate and defeat Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, according to American officials.","1325":"ECONOMIC VALUE Jordan's career value to the economy was pegged at $10 billion by Fortune magazine several years ago, and now that he is back, he is expected to pull the economy out of the recession, find Osama bin Laden and make purple popular for reasons that exclude dinosaurs named Barney.

Advantage: Jordan.","1326":"I am astonished that while American special forces are hunting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and Congressional and Postal Service employees line up to be tested for anthrax, you continue to obsess about 'campaign donors' (editorial, Oct. 25). It has become difficult to take seriously an editorial page that argues that in the wake of the attacks on our country, missile defense is less relevant while simultaneously arguing that campaign finance reform is 'more important than ever' (editorial, Oct. 16).","1327":"Analysts in the region continue to review the material taken from a compound on the outskirts of Kandahar and belonging to the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. But an early assessment has disappointed senior military commanders who believed that the cache might have clues to the whereabouts and operations of senior Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","1328":"There is a simple and effective way to conserve: begin immediately to tax gasoline at rates comparable to the high rates levied by European governments.

B2","1349":"ANKARA, Turkey, Nov. 1\u2014 Turkey said today that it would send 90 Special Forces troops to Afghanistan, making it the first Muslim nation to join the American-led attacks on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1350":"CAIRO, Nov. 1\u2014 Western and Arab news organizations today received copies of a letter handwritten in Arabic, carrying Osama bin Laden's signature, that urges Pakistan's Muslims to defend Islam against what it called a Christian crusade.","1351":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 1\u2014 Government officials intercepted telephone conversations in recent days in which members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda, spoke urgently of an imminent attack against American targets even larger than the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, senior government officials say.","1352":"Mr. Abu-Namous preached a spirit of unity between Islam, Christianity and Judaism. But his remarks reflected a prominent feeling in the Muslim and Arab worlds that the perpetrators could not be inspired by Islam, regardless of what the United States says is strong evidence pointing to Osama bin Laden, who has called for Muslims to wage war on America.","1353":"When the president or his spokesmen are asked about civilian casualties from our bombing in Afghanistan, they should answer: 'Yes, for the 30th straight day Osama bin Laden, a mass murderer, has cloaked himself in a human blanket of Afghan civilians. Unfortunately, this has led to some civilian deaths.' Or 'Yes, for the fourth straight week Osama bin Laden, the man who sends other Muslims to their death but never risks his own life, is now sending Afghans to die for him.'","1354":"Other experts stressed, however, that Mr. Bashiruddin Mahmood, an outspoken admirer of the Taliban, could not by himself help either the Taliban or Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorists build an actual nuclear weapon.","1355":"In Gaza, Mr. Arafat again put distance between himself and Osama bin Laden, rejecting as 'very dangerous talk' Mr. bin Laden's call for Muslims to rise up against Pakistan because of its collaboration in the American-led war on Afghanistan.","1356":"The indictment also says that a search of Mr. Awadallah's apartment turned up computer-generated photographs of Osama bin Laden.","1357":"A veteran prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has been appointed co-chief of the office's unit specializing in terrorism cases. The prosecutor, Kenneth M. Karas, replaces Patrick J. Fitzgerald, who was confirmed last week as United States attorney in Chicago. David N. Kelley continues as the other co-chief of the unit. Mr. Karas, 37, joined the prosecutor's office in 1992 and has been assisting in the investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Earlier this year, he helped try four men charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","1358":"As American jets prepared to drop the first bombs on Afghanistan on Oct. 7, the two men gathered with aides in the F.B.I.'s high-tech fifth-floor operations center to review a list of potential targets that needed extra protection if Osama bin Laden chose to retaliate. The list included nuclear plants, refineries, chemical plants and airports.","1359":"The delays have complicated a campaign to oust the Taliban and capture or kill the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden. More than three weeks into the bombing, the Northern Alliance shows little sign of being ready to advance. At the same time, the bombardment has complicated efforts to form a 'Southern Alliance' among the Pashtuns dominant the south of Afghanistan. Angered by the attacks, some Pashtuns seem to have rallied to the Taliban.","1360":"One of the conditions of his proposal to the Taliban, which had Mr. Karzai's blessing, was that they disentangle themselves from the Arab contingent, led by Osama bin Laden, a Pashtun leader said.","1361":"VIENNA, Nov. 3\u2014 Experts at a conference here on nuclear safeguards were divided today on whether the use of nuclear materials fits into the plans of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. But they agreed that improved safeguards of fissionable material and nuclear power stations were urgently needed.","1362":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 2\u2014 The Bush administration imposed stringent financial sanctions today on the anti-Israeli organizations Hamas, Hezbollah and 20 other suspected terrorist groups, significantly broadening the campaign to seize terrorist assets beyond groups with links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.","1364":"Washington holds Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.","1365":"The position that Ms. Nasser sets forth denouncing terrorism except when there is a political justification, like fighting a country that is viewed as an 'occupying power' is one that Osama bin Laden, Puerto Rican nationalists, the Irish Republican Army, the Tamil Tigers and other terrorist groups would be happy to support.","1366":"The Bush administration gave the Treasury Department authority to seize assets of 22 suspected terrorist groups, including two Muslim organizations, Hamas and Hezbollah. The move broadened the antiterror campaign beyond Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and signaled the administration's growing confidence in the stability of the antiterror coalition.","1367":"'Osama bin Laden launched that attack from Afghanistan, a place where you have been helping people for years,' he said. 'What you have done in Afghanistan and will continue to do is an important part of our foreign policy.'","1368":"She argues that Osama bin Laden is 'America's family secret,' the monstrous offspring of its support for the mujahedeen after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.","1370":"NUCLEAR THREAT -- At a conference in Vienna, experts were divided on whether the use of nuclear materials fits into the plans of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. B5","1371":"Two scientists had been 'looking into land research' on trips to Afghanistan in the last three years, and not passing along nuclear secrets or mat\u00e9riel to the Taliban or Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, an aide to President Pervez Musharraf said at a briefing. The aide, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, identified the two scientists as Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood and Chaudry Abdul Masheed. General Qureshi said nothing more about the third scientist, Mirza Yusuf Baig.","1372":"T-shirts lionizing Osama bin Laden are hits with those who feel themselves the world's dispossessed and see the terrorists striking a blow against an overweening superpower: in Algerian-populated suburbs of Paris and the Cape Flats of South Africa, in the streets of Cairo and Jakarta.","1373":"CAIRO, Nov. 3\u2014 In an attempt to play to Arab and Muslim popular opinion, Osama bin Laden portrayed the American military campaign in Afghanistan as a war against Islam, saying in a videotaped speech broadcast today that the Afghan people had done nothing to deserve such an onslaught.","1374":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 3\u2014 Four weeks after the United States began its military campaign to unseat the Taliban in Afghanistan and to destroy Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, there is an increasingly vigorous debate about whether substantial numbers of American combat troops will be needed to seal the victory in Afghanistan.","1375":"Much is expected of the Central Intelligence Agency these days, probably too much. As a pivotal front-line organization in the war against terrorism, the agency is supposed to detect and prevent new terror attacks, help locate and perhaps even kill Osama bin Laden and let President Bush know if the anthrax in the mail comes from Iraq -- to mention only a few of Washington's expectations. These are lofty demands to make of an institution that before Sept. 11 was still struggling to reinvent itself a decade after the end of the cold war. As much as the nation may yearn for a crack intelligence service that can save the day, there is no such outfit in Washington at present.","1376":"The Saudis are struggling with how far to go in acknowledging the presence of enemies in their midst. Last Sunday, the deputy interior minister, Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, said -- without proof -- that Osama bin Laden 'is not involved in any explosions in the kingdom.'","1377":"Osama bin Laden portrayed the American campaign in Afghanistan as a war against Islam.

Tracking the career of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and his links to Osama bin Laden.","1379":"The principal target is Al Qaeda, and the United States should not rest until it has destroyed that terrorist organization. Removing the Taliban from power, and discouraging states like Somalia and Sudan from taking in Osama bin Laden and his fellow terrorists, are major steps in that direction. But probably the most important ingredient in the war against Al Qaeda is good intelligence, which will allow the United States to locate the terrorists and strike at them with deadly force when the time is right -- and to locate, protect and reward those who come to the American side. The Bush administration should devote abundant resources to improving America's intelligence capabilities and to buying information on the terrorists from other governments.","1380":"The Taliban leader in Afghanistan, Mullah Mohammed Omar, as well as Osama bin Laden, have said that the conflict in Afghanistan is a 'holy war' pitting Muslims against Christians and Jews.","1381":"But the leader, Abdiqassim Salad Hassan, who is here for talks organized by the Kenyan government that aim to restore peace and unify his fractured country, is eager for America to return to Mogadishu. He hopes that the Sept. 11 attacks will serve to unite Somalia and the United States and not attract American bombs aimed at rooting out suspected links between his country and Osama bin Laden.","1382":"ANOTHER FRONT -- Twenty-three American military advisers visited the Philippines last week on a simple mission: hunt down an elusive band of guerrillas known as Abu Sayyaf, which American officials say has ties to Osama bin Laden. B4","1383":"The crawls on the bottom of the screen on cable news channels -- one more symptom of the overload -- often use misleading shorthand. Almost uniformly they said 'White House fears Osama bin Laden is sending coded messages' in his videos, which was not quite accurate. If you listened carefully to the televised news conference by Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, it was clear that what he said amounted to maybe, possibly, we don't really have any reason to think he is doing that. Yet the news crawls submissively adopted the stark, alarmist spin his tone suggested.","1384":"The government has been swift to capitalize on the new climate of fear, drawing parallels between the Basque group and Osama bin Laden's organization and pushing the European Union to streamline extradition measures that would leave E.T.A. members without safe havens in France and beyond.","1385":"Most of the 19 hijackers, perhaps all of them, spent time in Osama bin Laden's Afghan training camps, investigators now say. Some of the Sept. 11 soldiers appear to have met there. And like Mr. Atta and the other pilots, the muscle did not seem to fit the profile of suicide bombers as desperate and impoverished young men. With the exception of one, they were all Saudis, relatively well off and well educated. While the leaders seemed to be Islamic zealots, the muscle did not, indulging often in pornography and liquor.","1386":"Senior leaders of the Northern Alliance still claim that they are preparing to attack and help the American government topple the Taliban and capture Osama bin Laden. 'We are ready to attack,' Atiqullah Baryalai, the alliance's deputy defense minister, said earlier this week. 'Every day, we are getting stronger.'","1388":"Pakistan, to take the most obvious case, provides not only access to Afghanistan but also theological and ideological cover for Western nations fighting Muslims; as long as they stay with the alliance, it is hard for the Taliban government and the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, whom it shields, to argue that this is a war between civilizations or religions.","1389":"American officials say Abu Sayyaf has links to Osama bin Laden, which makes this an obvious place to expand the campaign against Al Qaeda. Interviews with local government officials, Muslim leaders, scholars and aid workers suggest those links, while plausible, are tenuous.","1390":"The United States has accused Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network of conducting both of those attacks.","1391":"Mr. Bush has been relentlessly upbeat, repeating almost daily, as he did again on Friday, that 'we're making very good progress' on both fronts, at home and abroad. He has left to others the more complicated messages -- that the Taliban show no sign of cracking, that no one knows how a Bronx woman who died this week contracted anthrax, that investigators are no closer to solving the mystery of whether the deadly powder is being sent by Osama bin Laden's followers, Iraq or domestic terrorists with a flair for biochemistry.","1393":"DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 4\u2014 Osama bin Laden is waging a war against the world and does not represent Arabs and Muslims, senior Arab officials said today at a gathering of foreign ministers here in the Syrian capital.","1394":"The 58-year-old general will leave behind a country where Friday Prayers have become a prelude to protests by thousands of Islamic militants who march from the mosques to burn effigies of President Musharraf beside those of President Bush, while photographs of Osama bin Laden are hoisted high.","1395":"A series of proposals to publish the words and ideas of Osama bin Laden are testing the willingness of book publishers to handle indisputably important but highly objectionable material, reviving a debate that has simmered since Houghton Mifflin published an English-language edition of 'Mein Kampf' in 1933.","1396":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4\u2014 For years American officials have suspected that Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network were taking advantage of the free-wheeling financial system of the United Arab Emirates, a tiny Persian Gulf nation that boasts of 47 banks and 105 money changers for its three million people.","1397":"The fierce, many-faceted threats of recent weeks have touched off a variety of cravings and urges, like a craving for information, understanding and certainty. The urge to help, to commemorate, to mourn or to warn. And, less intuitively, the urge to put up Web sites that link to topics like Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, bioterrorism, Islam, Osama bin Laden, the Pentagon or the World Trade Center.","1398":"'But the reality is that the threat of additional terrorist attacks are there,' he said, so long as the Taliban shelters Osama bin Laden and the leaders of his Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan.","1399":"THE ARAB LEAGUE -- Senior Arab officials meeting in Syria said Osama bin Laden was waging a war against the world and does not represent Arabs and Muslims.

'I am trying to do the same.'","1401":"Proposals to publish the words and ideas of Osama bin Laden are testing the willingness of book publishers to handle indisputably important but highly objectionable material. [C8.]","1402":"Those groups join the list that already includes groups under the control of or with ties to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of being behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","1403":"'Osama bin Laden says that all good Muslims should kill Americans,' declared Mr. Esmer, a 22-year-old Canadian comedian who was born in Turkey and raised by secular Muslim parents. 'I feel guilty telling the guy behind me in the movie theater to stop talking. Where does Osama think I would find the confidence to kill someone? I try to be a good Muslim, but it's tough just not eating pork. I mean, the McRib is so ---- oh well, at least I have my wives.'","1404":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 30\u2014 Prince Mamdouh bin Abdel Aziz is holding court in a glass tent with wall-to-wall beige carpeting erected in the garden behind his low-slung mansion, recalling the night a decade ago when Osama bin Laden attended an evening salon to describe his exploits fighting in Afghanistan.","1405":"Here in Qatar, on the Persian Gulf, Al Jazeera TV, the freest and most popular in the Arab world, recently ran a debate featuring the liberal Kuwaiti political scientist Shafeeq Ghabra versus an Islamist and a radical Arab nationalist. While the latter two tried to excuse Osama bin Laden, Mr. Ghabra hammered back: 'The Lebanese civil war was not an American creation; neither was the Iran-Iraq war; neither was bin Laden. These are our creations. We need to look inside. We cannot be in this blame-others mode forever.'","1406":"It was only after Mr. Ressam's conviction that he decided to cooperate with prosecutors, who have since said he provided a wealth of information about terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, run by Osama bin Laden, as well as the operations and methods of the terrorists, their trainers and names of terrorist cell members.","1407":"At the same time, pressed by Washington not to get in the way of the war against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, Mr. Sharon clearly supports Mr. Peres's efforts to restore some semblance of comity with Mr. Arafat.","1408":"Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden","1409":"The administration has responded with intensified efforts to get its word out. When officials learned that Osama bin Laden had made another videotape available to Al Jezeera, the international Arab-language television station, for example, they quickly arranged for Christopher W. S. Ross, a fluent Arab speaker and former ambassador to Syria, to appear on the program.","1410":"Those groups join the list that already includes groups under the control of or with ties to Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of being behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","1411":"'Osama bin Laden says that all good Muslims should kill Americans,' declared Mr. Esmer, a 22-year-old Canadian comedian who was born in Turkey and raised by secular Muslim parents.

Our second goal was to force the Taliban government to turn Osama bin Laden over to us, which we have not succeeded in doing.","1414":"Most surprising was the change in attitude towards the United Nations. Since the Taliban took power in Kabul in 1996, they have been denied Afghanistan's United Nations seat because of their human rights abuses, and have defied a succession of Security Council resolutions demanding that the Taliban stop harboring Osama bin Laden.","1415":"Because of an editing error, a chart yesterday with an article about Osama bin Laden's challenge to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia misstated the name and title of the leader who serves below the ailing King Fahd. The official is Crown Prince Abdullah Abdel Aziz al-Saud (not simply Abdel Aziz); he is the first deputy prime minister; the title of prime minister, though rarely used, belongs to the king.","1416":"Mr. Karzai is regarded warmly in Washington, in part because he has long seen Osama bin Laden as a serious threat. After the battle last Thursday, Mr. Karzai told Ahmed by satellite telephone that most at tackers were Arabs and Pakistanis.","1417":"PRESIDENT BUSH, on Osama bin Laden. [B4]","1418":"BERLIN, Nov. 6\u2014 Despite nervousness among Europeans about the length and tactics of the American-led war against Afghanistan, European governments have not wavered in their support for Washington. The Europeans have had their own experience with terrorists, regard themselves as vulnerable to terrorist attacks, and understand that to oppose Washington now would put them on the side of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","1419":"The war against terrorism will be won only when we combine our strengths. We have a vast coalition that is uniting the world and increasingly isolating the terrorists, a coalition that includes many Arab and Muslim countries. I'm encouraged by what their leaders are saying. The head of the 22-nation Arab League rejected the claims of the terrorist leader and said he, Osama bin Laden, doesn't speak in the names of Arabs and Muslims.","1420":"For the first time, the president himself accused Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, of seeking to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But other officials said there was no new evidence that Mr. bin Laden had in fact gotten his hands on weapons of mass destruction.","1421":"In a speech today to Central and Eastern European leaders and at an appearance in the Rose Garden with President Jacques Chirac of France, President Bush also sought to bolster support overseas by drawing a still darker picture of Osama bin Laden.","1422":"It's been known for years that Osama bin Laden wanted to go nuclear. So why would the president gild the plutonium lily by invoking a nuclear threat now, when Americans are already wincing and flinching their way through life? Why put fangs on a vampire?","1423":"He referred to four man-made caves on the military depot he runs here and to dozens of others that line the valley, the mountain stronghold of the anti-Taliban forces. Built to store ammunition, the caves here are similar to those in southern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leadership are believed to be hiding.","1424":"The Pentagon's hope was that the bombing attacks would force Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders to leave their sanctuaries, exposing them to attack. The image the Pentagon conjured up was of helicopter gunships packed with commandos in 'hot pursuit' of Osama bin Laden and his key lieutenants, to use President Bush's description.","1425":"The defectors, one of whom was a lieutenant general and once one of the most senior officers in the Iraqi intelligence service, the Mukhabarat, said they did not know if the Islamic militants being trained at the camp, known as Salman Pak, were linked to Osama bin Laden.","1426":"'Follow the money' is a tried and true maxim for investigators, and it works for President Bush, too. Repeatedly, he has made clear that one way to strike at Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, is to cut off its cash flow. Now that effort has taken a new course.","1427":"Rising unemployment in Pakistan could pose political problems for the United States since the nation is a key ally in the effort to rid Afghanistan of Osama bin Laden and his allies.","1428":"Al Taqwa is an association of offshore banks and financial management firms that have helped Al Qaeda shift money around the world. Al Barakaat is a group of money-wiring and communication companies owned by a friend and supporter of Osama bin Laden.","1429":"On a day that the Pakistani government cracked down on the daily anti-American news conferences given by the Taliban's ambassador in Islamabad, Osama bin Laden appeared to find a new avenue of propaganda: children.","1430":"For years, Osama bin Laden has pointed to the American presence in the Persian Gulf region as the primary justification for attacks against the West. He has said that 'infidel forces' have no place on the Arabian peninsula and that the governments that harbor them should be toppled.","1431":"Mr. Nada said he believed that he was a victim of guilt by association because he is a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and has had members of Osama bin Laden's immensely wealthy family as clients. 'I have been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood for 50 years,' he said. 'That is no secret. But it is not a violent organization.'","1432":"The financial networks are called Al Barakaat and Al Taqwa, and President Bush said they did far more than move cash. The groups, with a presence in more than 40 countries, also financed the movement of arms, provided secure communications and served as a network for Osama bin Laden to transmit intelligence and instructions to terrorist cells in the loosely linked Al Qaeda organization, government officials said.","1433":"SPEAKING FOR BIN LADEN -- Osama bin Laden appeared to find a new avenue of propaganda: four boys said to be his sons, who were filmed brandishing weapons and speaking of the Afghans' support for the Taliban. B3","1434":"From shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States until his last appearance on Monday, the Taliban envoy, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, has conducted a wide-ranging session almost every weekday to set out the Taliban's positions on the terrorist attacks, the American demands for the surrender of Osama bin Laden and the American bombing.","1435":"It was Mr. Blair, not Mr. Bush, who released the white paper detailing the case against Osama bin Laden, and it is Mr. Blair who has traveled far more extensively since Sept. 11 -- 40,000 miles -- than Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.","1436":"By welcoming French, German, Italian and Turkish troops to the war against terrorism, the United States is shoring up international support for its campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. The addition of these forces, some of which may be involved in combat operations, will render military decision-making more cumbersome. That is an acceptable price for ensuring the diplomatic solidarity needed to sustain an extended and difficult armed campaign.","1438":"On the day after federal agents raided and padlocked five money-transfer operations in Minneapolis that the authorities say were part of a financial pipeline funneling money to Osama bin Laden, many Somalis here wanted to make one thing clear: they do not send their hard-earned money to the man who has become America's most wanted terrorist.","1439":"THE MONEY TRAIL -- The day after federal agents raided five money-transfer operations in Minneapolis that they say funneled money to Osama bin Laden, many Somali refugees in the city made one thing clear: they do not send their hard-earned money to the world's most wanted terrorist. B7","1440":"Reading Mr. Friedman's column, one gets the impression that only two or three of millions of Arabs and Muslims 'had the guts' to speak out and that the others support Osama bin Laden. The worst thing for Americans would be to fall into a trap of generalizations that obscure the principled stand that the Arabs and Egypt have taken against terrorism.","1441":"Hmmm, I thought, that's not a good sign. I started to wonder: Is America the Titanic and Pakistan the iceberg we're about to hit, while we're searching for Osama bin Laden in the fog of Afghanistan? Or is Pakistan the Titanic, its president, Pervez Musharraf, the captain, America the only passengers and Afghanistan the iceberg we're about to hit?","1442":"WORRIES AT THE U.N. -- The Taliban's chief ward, Osama bin Laden, was making the United Nations nervous. Over the weekend, he issued another of his videotaped messages, this time saying the world organization had aligned itself with 'crusader' Western interests and against Muslims. Secretary General Kofi Annan is a 'criminal,' he said. And where President Bush has insisted that the United States was in a war against terror and not against Muslims, Mr. bin Laden basically said the opposite was true: that the target is Islam, not him.","1443":"Wahhabism, the puritanical Islamic sect that is strong in Saudi Arabia and is followed by Osama bin Laden, has long been an obsession of the Russian state and news media. Some Caucasus rebels studied in Saudi Arabia and identify with the Wahhabi branch. 'Wahhabism' is now a Russian code word for extremism, and is banned by several republics.","1444":"Not a word was said about the quest to hunt down Osama bin Laden, nor the attacks in the United States. So the reason the Afghan people might need help went unmentioned.","1445":"Not a word was said about the quest to hunt down Osama bin Laden, nor the attacks in the United States. So the reason the Afghan people might need help went unmentioned.","1446":"General Musharraf's support for the American campaign against Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, has enraged the militant groups and Taliban-influenced Afghan refugee groups in Pakistan, which have mounted protests throughout the country.","1447":"Despite or perhaps even because of the terrorist threat, President Bush and Mr. Zoellick made the talks a test of leadership. They say a successful outcome would show that Osama bin Laden had not succeeded in disrupting an open and interconnected world. Mr. Zoellick called the talks a mission to 'counter the revulsive destructionism of terrorism.'","1448":"At the same time, Prince Faisal made clear that Saudi Arabia fully supports the American military campaign in Afghanistan to destroy Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","1449":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 8\u2014 As scores of world leaders converge on New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly, Osama bin Laden's latest message to the world has provoked profound new security concerns for the United Nations and its global work force.","1450":"President Mohammad Khatami of Iran yesterday branded as extremist Osama bin Laden's version of Islam and said it did not represent the majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims.","1451":"The first important military victory of the war against terrorism seemed close at hand yesterday, with reports by Northern Alliance forces that they had taken the northern Afghanistan stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif. Capture of the city, which has been under Taliban rule, would provide an important military, psychological and political boost to the American-led campaign to drive the Taliban from power and bring Osama bin Laden to justice. But because the city is separated from the southern population centers of Afghanistan by nearly impassable mountains, the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif is not likely to lead to the Taliban's rapid collapse.","1452":"In an interview with a Pakistani newspaper, Osama bin Laden said he had chemical and nuclear weapons and 'if America used them against us, we reserve the right to use them.'","1453":"IRAN'S LEADER -- President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, in his first interview with an American publication since assuming the presidency in 1997, branded as extremist Osama bin Laden's version of Islam and said it did not represent the majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims.

White House officials called on network executives last month, after a videotaped statement by Mr. bin Laden was widely broadcast on Oct. 7. The administration persuaded the networks that self-censorship was necessary to the war effort. The tapes of Mr. bin Laden were merely propaganda, it was suggested. Besides, he might be using the tapes to send hidden messages to terrorists, although no evidence was offered to support this notion. Network officials agreed to treat future broadcasts with care.","1461":"PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS -- President Bush tried to cast the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in the broadest global context as he told the United Nations that every member country was a potential target of terrorism and that the responsibility for fighting to stop it was 'binding on every nation with a place in this chamber.'

Mohamed, testified to a federal grand jury investigating the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden used the technique: 'In 1997, [Mohamed] told the F.B.I. about networks of terrorists,' wrote Weiser, 'known as 'sleepers,' who lie low for years but do not need to be told what to do.' The reporter quoted an F.B.I. document released in court holding that Mohamed knew 'that there are hundreds of 'sleepers' or 'submarines' in place who don't fit neatly into the terrorist profile.'","1465":"UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 10\u2014 President Bush tried to cast the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in the broadest global context today as he told the United Nations that every member country was a potential target of terrorism and that responsibility for fighting it was 'binding on every nation with a place in this chamber.'","1466":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 10\u2014 The United States has identified sites in Afghanistan that are suspected of involvement in Osama bin Laden's efforts to acquire and produce chemical and biological weapons, but none have been bombed since the military campaign began, according to American military and intelligence officials.","1467":"Asked tonight whether he believed a claim by Osama bin Laden that the Qaeda organization possesses nuclear and chemical weapons, Mr. Putin said such statements were generally made in an attempt to sow panic. He said he was certain that none of Russia's weapons of mass destruction had fallen into terrorist hands.","1468":"'All I want to do is make a better future,' said Mr. Nassr, more interested in discussing the veal parmigiano than Osama bin Laden.","1469":"The northern border was given little attention as a terrorist entry point until two years ago, when Ahmed Ressam, an operative of Osama bin Laden, was caught trying to enter the United States with bomb-making material in the trunk of his rental car. Mr. Ressam was later convicted in a failed plot to blow up the Los Angeles International Airport.","1471":"BIN LADEN'S POSSIBLE ARSENAL -- For the United States, the primary target in this war is of course Osama bin Laden, who told a Pakistani newspaper that he had nuclear and chemical weapons and was prepared to use them if, by his logic, the Americans forced his hand.","1472":"Jane Lahr, seated for her first cut since Sept. 11, held forth about goddess power, her own contribution to the campaign against Osama bin Laden. 'The cultures that did this to us don't care about the female principle,' she said, as a stylist named Brian Devine sculptured a cascade of Rita Hayworth waves. 'If I had my druthers, we'd be dropping estrogen on Afghanistan, not bombs.' A few chairs down, Skyler Madison, a life coach and hypnotherapist, finished a $250 regimen that included hair, eyebrows, nails and lots of talk about the war; she would have to go elsewhere for her Botox and collagen treatments. As her part of the war effort, she asked for bangs like Paula Zahn's. 'All of this is very high maintenance,' she said. Though she cut back after Sept. 11, she said: 'Certain things you just can't stop. Like nothing would keep me from my hair coloring.' And so it went.","1473":"KUWAIT, Nov. 10\u2014 Osama bin Laden is not being portrayed as a hero in the Arab media. But neither is the American war in Afghanistan being portrayed as anything heroic, or even wise or necessary.","1474":"It is on just this Arab -- or, better, Islamic -- street that President Bush must fight in his war against Osama bin Laden and his terrorists, a battleground for the public's mood that may ultimately be more important than the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan. And this is not only a war between Mr. Bush and Mr. bin Laden; leaders of countries from Egypt to Pakistan must also weigh how to court and contain the street -- how much they can repress expressions of hatred for America when their countries are, however conditionally, American allies in the war against terrorism.","1475":"These days, the class is focusing on terrorism, Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan as well as the entire volatile region of South Asia. As a final project, students will be split into groups and assigned a country like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Britain, China or Russia -- and they will have to explain that country's role in the coalition fighting terrorism and show an understanding of the nation and its policies in this conflict.","1476":"WASHINGTON\u2014 AT the embassy bombings trial earlier this year, Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network looked nothing like the far-reaching and sophisticated terror organization that most Americans have feared and loathed since Sept. 11. Instead, Al Qaeda Inc. resembled a start-up company struggling to adapt to the ever-changing rules of the new economy.","1477":"To reach foreign audiences, especially in the Islamic world, the State Department brought in Charlotte Beers, a former advertising executive, who is using her marketing skills to try to make American values as much a brand name as McDonald's hamburgers or Ivory soap. The department's efforts are also meant to counter the propaganda of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.","1478":"The weak Somalian government, just a year old and not recognized by most of the world, has vowed to root out terrorism and says it takes seriously American allegations that fundamentalists inside Somalia have aided Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. Still, Somalia is wincing at the American reprisals and is not persuaded that its struggling citizens are secretly planning attacks against the United States.","1479":"But experts on the Middle East said Washington did not want to shift its policies in a way that could allow Osama bin Laden to claim that his terror attacks had compelled Washington to address Palestinian grievances. Thus the administration has sought to balance its approach, and to avoid too extensive an initiative.","1481":"In mid-May, two of Saddam's secret service agents arrived at the clinic of Dr. Mohammed Khayal, Baghdad's leading kidney specialist. The doctor hurriedly packed a bag and was escorted to a government car. Three days later, he was returned, and the building was soon abuzz with the word that Saddam's Dr. Khayal had been to Afghanistan where his patient was Osama bin Laden.","1482":"Mr. Putin gave a crucial boost to relations after Sept. 11 by providing strong support for Mr. Bush's campaign against international terrorism. He cleared the way for American military forces to use bases in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Central Asian nations that border Afghanistan and were once Soviet republics. Moscow has also helped to arm guerrilla forces in Afghanistan. In the talks that begin tomorrow, the two leaders can enhance their cooperation against Osama bin Laden and other terrorist threats and work to narrow their differences on arms control and other matters.","1483":"Officials of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body for monitoring nuclear programs, are deeply skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim, in an interview published in Pakistan on Friday, that he possesses nuclear weapons.","1484":"ATOMIC THREAT -- Nuclear weapons monitors are skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim that he possesses nuclear weapons. But given the vulnerability of material in the former Soviet Union, the increasing professionalism of nuclear smuggling and the relative ease of fabricating a primitive weapon, they cannot rule it out. B1","1485":"Officials of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body for monitoring nuclear programs, are deeply skeptical of Osama bin Laden's claim, in an interview published in Pakistan on Friday, that he possesses nuclear weapons.","1486":"The reason for a southern strategy is clear. Washington needs a southern Afghan alliance that will provide intelligence and assistance to American and British Special Forces to hunt down Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden, a senior administration official said.","1487":"'Even though the terrorists themselves may be middle class and Osama bin Laden may be rich, they get their enormous support from people in poverty,' Mr. Conway said. He said his organization planned to continue its efforts to alleviate poverty and hunger and to provide health care around the world -- not just around Afghanistan and the Middle East but in Africa and elsewhere.","1488":"A former F.B.I. antiterror official who was killed at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 complained bitterly last summer that the United States was unwilling to confront Saudi Arabia over Osama bin Laden and that oil ruled American foreign policy, according to a new book published in France.","1489":"The two main thrusts were being carried out by Zarbati assault forces, backed by tanks. The elite units were created by Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance leader who was assassinated in September by two men believed to be connected to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network.","1490":"They have also questioned the students themselves, asking about their views on Osama bin Laden, the names of their favorite restaurants and their plans for after graduation.","1491":"What is more worrisome than costs is Osama bin Laden's new claim that he has nuclear weapons, ready to go. On Sunday talk programs, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld were skeptical. But Russian officials acknowledge lax security at their nuclear storage facilities, and say they know of two terrorist stakeouts and one loss of fissionable material. Atomic energy officials in Vienna say that, given the relative ease of fabricating a nuclear weapon, nuclear terrorism cannot be ruled out.","1492":"So far, no trademark applications have been filed using 'Taliban' or 'Al Qaeda.' But there are several incorporating variants of the name Osama bin Laden into slogans on clothing, knickknacks or bumper stickers. These include 'Osama -- Can you see the bombs bursting in air?' 'Trash Bin Laden,' 'Bin Laden to rest,' 'Bin there, bombed that,' and 'Osama, Yo Mama.'","1493":"After the immigration service reported that the two were already in the country, the F.B.I. was notified and began searching for them. When their names showed up on the passenger manifest for Flight 77, the information provided one of the first clues pointing to a terrorist operation linked to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","1494":"ALTERED BIN LADEN -- Hamid Mir, a Pakistani reporter who is the first journalist known to have met Osama bin Laden since the Sept. 11 attacks, says Mr. bin Laden is 'a changed man,' tense and aging. B1","1495":"The bearded man in question was Osama bin Laden, whom Mr. Mir, a 36-year-old Pakistani newspaperman, had interviewed a couple of days earlier, becoming the first journalist known to have met Mr. bin Laden since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.","1496":"In more than a month of war, the Bush administration has struggled to make headway against the Taliban and the fighters recruited by Osama bin Laden. And now that the Northern Alliance has swept across northern Afghanistan, the White House is calculating that the advance will send a resounding message.","1497":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan\u2014 You need only spend an afternoon walking through the Storytellers' Bazaar here in Peshawar, a few miles from the Afghan border, to understand that America needs to do its business in Afghanistan -- eliminate Osama bin Laden and his Taliban pro tectors -- as quickly as possible and get out of here. This is not a neighborhood where we should linger. This is not Mr. Rogers's neighborhood.","1498":"'They brought Osama bin Laden to this country,' said Hashmatullah, seated in Habibullah's Restaurant. 'We will kill them.'","1499":"One omission from the statements appears to be Chechnya, where Russian soldiers have employed often brutal tactics in their fight against Muslim rebels cast by Mr. Putin as Islamic extremists akin to Osama bin Laden.","1500":"The power vacuum in Kabul seems to be enticing Northern Alliance forces to enter the city despite their promises to remain outside. The alliance is little more than a coalition of convenience among chieftains of the main ethnic minority groups of northern Afghanistan. While it has been greeted warmly in the northern towns it has captured, it cannot count on a similar reception in multi-ethnic Kabul. Some of the alliance's leaders held power there in the early 1990's, an unpleasant experience for the capital's residents. In addition to human rights abuses and egregious misgovernment, incessant warfare killed more than 30,000 residents and pounded much of the city into rubble. A repeat performance could strengthen the Taliban's grip over their southern stronghold around Kandahar, where Osama bin Laden has found sanctuary.","1501":"America's most potent weapon against Osama bin Laden is democracy. The day we support it for all the people of the world, he and his barbarians are doomed.","1502":"After the immigration service reported that the two were already in the country, the F.B.I. was notified and began searching for them. When their names showed up on the passenger manifest for Flight 77, the information provided one of the first clues pointing to a terrorist operation linked to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","1503":"ALTERED BIN LADEN -- Hamid Mir, a Pakistani reporter who is the first journalist known to have met Osama bin Laden since the Sept. 11 attacks, says Mr. bin Laden is 'a changed man,' tense and aging. B1","1504":"His response followed the arguments presented by many Arabic governments at the General Assembly, which sought to draw a distinction between Osama bin Laden and 'resistance movements.'","1505":"The color our foreign policy will be wearing this fall is gray. We have to capture Osama bin Laden and quell terrorism, so the Bush administration is making compromises and offering carrots where it once turned up its nose.","1506":"The Pentagon still has no plans to send large numbers of American troops into Afghanistan at this point, officials said, even though Taliban leaders and Osama bin Laden remain at large.","1509":"Foreign affairs, which accounted for 45 percent of television network newscasts in the 1970's, was down to 13.5 percent by 1995, according to a Harvard study in 1997. Other surveys show that newspapers had cut foreign news by four-fifths over the same period. According to Pat Mitchell, the president of the Public Broadcasting Service, there were three times as many stories about 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' last year as there were about Osama bin Laden. No wonder so few Americans knew the story of radical Islam. Before Sept. 11, prominent federal commissions predicting terrorist attacks and breakdowns in airport security had hardly made a dent in a news culture overdosing on JonBenet and sex scandals. Only weeks before the attack, some of the same high-powered network correspondents who would be covering Washington's search for the murderers of thousands of people had been filing breathless nightly reports on the vicissitudes of Gary Condit, who hadn't even been charged with a crime.","1510":"Ten weeks ago this bill, or the equally bad bill proposed by Senate Republicans, wouldn't have stood a chance. But now people who want to give the Social Security surplus to campaign donors think they can get away with it, because they can blame Osama bin Laden for future budget shortfalls.","1511":"'Any person who goes hither and thither is like a slaughtered chicken that falls and dies,' Mullah Omar said in a radio address. 'You should regroup yourselves, resist and fight.' He did not refer to his guest, the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, whose whereabouts remain unclear.","1512":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 13\u2014 Nearly half of Afghanistan tumbled out of the hands of the Taliban today in a dramatic turn in the five-week-old war that shifted the focus of military operations to the south, intensified the hunt for Osama bin Laden and left unanswered the overarching political question of who will govern Afghanistan.","1513":"Another magazine showed Maradona at his recent birthday party wearing an Osama bin Laden mask, one of several signs that he may be growing more anti-American.","1514":"Mr. Bush signed the order allowing for the military tribunals shortly before leaving this afternoon for his ranch in Crawford, Tex. White House officials said the order did not create a military tribunal or a list of terrorists to be tried. Instead, they said, it was an 'option' that the president would have should Osama bin Laden or his associates in Al Qaeda be captured. If the tribunals were created, it would be the first time since World War II that such an approach was used, officials said.","1515":"Mr. Bush signed the order allowing for the military tribunals shortly before leaving this afternoon for his ranch in Crawford, Tex.

The officials said he hadn't tried to leave the country. B2","1517":"MADRID, Nov. 13\u2014 The Spanish police arrested 11 people today, mostly Islamic warriors with experience in Afghanistan or Bosnia, and accused them of recruiting volunteers to carry out attacks on behalf of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda. It was the second time in two months that Spain had dismantled a cell connected to Mr. bin Laden.","1518":"NEW EVIDENCE ON BIN LADEN -- Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain made public new evidence that he said showed Osama bin Laden acknowledging that he was behind the Sept. 11 attacks. B5","1519":"But downtown Riyadh is broadcasting a more radical message these days, one difficult to discern amid the country's stifling layers of censorship but that takes as its target both the regime's corruption and its alliance with the United States. Since Sept. 11 deep fissures have opened in that relationship. Fifteen of that morning's hijackers were Saudis; their faces haunt this documentary like unanswered questions. And Osama bin Laden, though an outcast, is one among 50 siblings belonging to a leading Saudi establishment family.","1520":"MADRID, Nov. 14\u2014 The Spanish police, who dismantled a radical recruitment cell this week after it was linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, said they were searching for another three Islamic militants who appeared in a video seized in police raids on Tuesday.","1521":"Prof. Phillip B. Heymann of Harvard Law School, a former deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, said he believed that the government wanted the military tribunal because of a fear that it might not be able to convict Osama bin Laden or other suspected terrorists in civilian courts.","1522":"LONDON, Nov. 14\u2014 Prime Minister Tony Blair made public today new evidence in which he said Osama bin Laden acknowledged for the first time that he was behind the suicide hijackings of Sept. 11.","1523":"They have blocked roads to try to trap Taliban and Al Qaeda commanders. They have marked potential landing strips for American forces and conducted reconnaissance missions. And they have searched for traces of Osama bin Laden and Taliban leaders.","1524":"This time people were very interested, particularly as they faced the prospect of what to do should Osama bin Laden or his associates in Al Qaeda be captured. Administration officials have said they did not want a long, public American trial of Mr. bin Laden that could turn him into a martyr or cause further terrorism in his name.","1525":"The last thing we want to see is American youths losing their lives for a worthless cause. Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden will be dealt with by the local tribesmen in Afghanistan while the remnants of the Taliban will wither away in the coming winter. We absolutely do not need any Americans on the ground.","1526":"SHIFTING TACTICS -- With the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban forces having moved so stunningly fast to capture about 80 percent of the country, American commanders shifted tactics. Expect fewer air strikes against Taliban troops in the field, they said, and a more intense hunt for enemy leaders, above all Osama bin Laden. More than 100 American commandos were said to be in southern Afghanistan, carrying out covert operations against officials of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist network.","1527":"It was the worst Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence since Oct. 8, when Mr. Arafat's forces opened fire on demonstrators in the Gaza Strip, killing two, to stop a protest in support of Osama bin Laden and against the war in Afghanistan. Then as now, Mr. Arafat was seeking to comply with what he perceived to be American desires.","1528":"An attack was ordered on Kabul Tuesday after the United States received 'compelling evidence of Al Qaeda personnel' inside, a Defense Department official said today. Officials presume that all those inside were killed. But the official dismissed reports that Osama bin Laden had been spotted during the recent days of confusion.","1529":"The central targets of the five-week-old American operation, Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda lieutenants, as well Mullah Muhammad Omar and other leaders of the Taliban, remained at large.","1530":"But let's get to the target that this blunderbuss order is intended to hit. Here's the big worry in Washington now: What do we do if Osama bin Laden gives himself up? A proper trial like that Israel afforded Adolf Eichmann, it is feared, would give the terrorist a global propaganda platform. Worse, it would be likely to result in widespread hostage-taking by his followers to protect him from the punishment he deserves.","1531":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Nov. 15\u2014 Materials left behind in a compound used by Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, suggest that the terrorist group may have been trying to develop chemical arms and other unconventional weapons.","1532":"The temptation to employ extrajudicial proceedings to deal with Osama bin Laden and his henchmen is understandable. The horrific attacks of Sept. 11 give credence to the notion that these foreign terrorists are uniquely malevolent outlaws, undeserving of American constitutional protections. Military tribunals can act swiftly, anywhere, averting the security problems that a high-profile trial in New York or Washington could pose.","1533":"'Holy War, Inc.,' Sunday's installment of 'National Geographic Explorer,' complements 'Unholy War' in more than its title: it begins in Pakistan with a classroom of little boys being trained for a jihad. Based on Peter L. Bergen's new book, 'Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden,' it relies more heavily than Ms. Shah's films on Western experts and reporting. And although it is disappointing and perfunctory next to Mr. Bergen's slim yet thorough book, it has a thoughtful, opinionated quality rare among current documentaries.","1534":"Asked whether Osama bin Laden might be more likely to attack because of Taliban losses in Afghanistan, Mr. Ridge said 'common sense' dictated that 'if you are putting pressure on your enemy in one area or one venue, they may choose to act out in a separate area, in a different venue.'","1535":"But by last year, when a son was born to Sara, one of 11 al-Munaif children, the young woman did not hesitate to choose a name meant to send a very different signal to the West. The little boy is Osama, after Osama bin Laden.","1536":"At first, it seemed possible that the investigation into the attacks might keep her in the job even longer. Over more than eight years, Ms. White had developed into the nation's pre-eminent prosecutor of international terrorism, and had overseen the investigation of Osama bin Laden for more than half a decade.","1537":"'I don't think anyone wants to see Osama bin Laden brought before a court here to be defended by Johnnie Cochran,' he said.","1538":"If the assertions are true, the prisoners could provide valuable intelligence about the location of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, chief of the Taliban.","1539":"Re 'Why Are We Hiding bin Laden?' (Op-Ed, Nov. 11): Robert H. Giles seems to think that we Americans are missing out on some important news by not seeing Osama bin Laden's videotapes on national television; that Al Jazeera is a model news organization and that Osama bin Laden has some serious political messages we should be hearing.","1540":"You suggest that the United States should be part of a multinational force to establish security in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban by the Northern Alliance (editorial, Nov. 14). Let's be honest. Our only real interest in Afghanistan is to eliminate it as a base for Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorist organization. Once that is accomplished, why should our troops be stationed in a country that holds little, if any, strategic interest for the United States?","1542":"The Sunday Telegraph of London was the only news organization to report that Osama bin Laden had justified the Sept. 11 attacks in a recent video circulating among his supporters. Four days later, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain cited that video as evidence of Mr. bin Laden's complicity.","1543":"For the United States, the brass ring is capturing Osama bin Laden and destroying his network, Al Qaeda. He remained an elusive target, but he left traces behind in a compound in Kabul, where materials suggested that Al Qaeda was working on chemical weapons and other unconventional arms.","1544":"A Clinton administration appointee, Ms. White stayed on after President Bush took office so she could complete work on the trial of four men accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the bombings of two American embassies in 1998. All four were convicted last spring and sentenced last month to life in prison.","1545":"And crucially: Where is Osama bin Laden? His protector, Mullah Muhammad Omar, is still at large, issuing dire threats against the United States, and so is much of Al Qaeda's network, in Afghanistan and elsewhere.","1546":"The mullah's language in the interview was far closer to that of Osama bin Laden, which indicated, experts said, that as the Taliban crumbled, it was also splitting into sharply divided groups. Mullah Omar leads the hard-line faction, as he has in the past. But there are moderates whom Mr. Karzai is appealing to and getting support from, according to his supporters.","1547":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u2014 Although it was never his intention, Osama bin Laden has triggered the most serious debate in years, among Muslims, about Islam's ability to adapt to modernity. In Arab states this debate is still muted. But in Pakistan and other Muslim countries with a relatively free press, writers are raising it openly and bluntly. Nothing could be more important.","1549":"Muhammad Atef, an Al Qaeda military commander who was reported killed in the American bombing raids near Kabul, held a unique place in Osama bin Laden's hierarchy, officials say: he was military commander and a member of Al Qaeda's ruling shura council, as well as an in-law of Mr. bin Laden.","1550":"The apparent Qaeda presence in a Taliban defense ministry building suggested that Osama bin Laden's organization and the radical Islamic government were closely linked.","1551":"The Pentagon said it had received credible reports that in a separate action against the Qaeda terrorist network of Osama bin Laden, one of its most senior members, Muhammad Atef, was killed by American bombs in an air strike near Kabul earlier this week. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that he had been briefed on reports that 'seem authoritative' indicating that Mr. Atef was killed, but he cautioned that it was too soon to say definitively that Mr. Atef was dead.","1552":"Their bombing may not have hit the big prey, but American officials say it will have to do for now. They said airstrikes in Kabul were believed to have killed Muhammad Atef, one of Osama bin Laden's most trusted aides and a man believed to have helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In short, the Americans say the bin Laden terror network, Al Qaeda, is hurting, though it remains a decided threat.","1553":"An important consequence of this imminent shift is that America and its allies can soon concentrate on hunting down Osama bin Laden and his chief confederates. One important success in this area may already have been achieved with the reported death of Muhammad Atef, a top bin Laden deputy, in an airstrike this week. It is imperative that the remaining leaders of Al Qaeda be kept from fleeing Afghanistan or its immediate vicinity. Pursuing them in the snowy mountains and cave redoubts of Central or South Asia will be difficult enough. Finding them if they flee to the jungles of Southeast Asia or sanctuaries in Chechnya or East Africa would be considerably harder.","1554":"Prosecutors say Mr. Ressam has provided a wealth of information about terrorist training camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, details of operations and the names of terrorist cell members. Last summer, Mr. Ressam also testified in a trial in Manhattan against another man charged in the plot, Mokhtar Haouari, who was convicted of conspiracy.","1555":"An article on Thursday about Prime Minister Tony Blair's description of a videotape that he said showed Osama bin Laden acknowledging for the first time that he was behind the terror attacks of Sept. 11 referred to the tape imprecisely. While it had not been shown on television, The Sunday Telegraph of London published an article about it last Sunday. It was not unpublicized.","1556":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 16\u2014 One of Osama bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants has reportedly been killed in a bombing raid, American officials said today. His death, the officials said, would be an important success in a global campaign that has curtailed Al Qaeda's ability to mount large-scale terrorist operations.","1557":"BIN LADEN AIDE REPORTED KILLED -- One of Osama bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants, Muhammad Atef, has reportedly been killed in a bombing raid, American officials said. His death, they said, would be an important success in a global campaign that has curtailed Al Qaeda's ability to mount large-scale terrorist operations. A1","1558":"The retreat would end the seven-year reign of the extremist Islamic group, which gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","1559":"But if the public relations war is as important as the military war, as our allies and the administration insist, such trials would give the enemy a victory of enormous proportions. President Mohammad Khatami of Iran denounced the Sept. 11 attacks, but said he needed evidence that Osama bin Laden was responsible. Presenting evidence in secret will convince no one and will only fortify Mr. bin Laden's propaganda. And military executions of convicted terrorists after such trials will create a new generation of martyrs.","1560":"Could Osama bin Laden be an example of the new millennium's dictator?","1561":"Al Jazeera, which claims a global audience of 35 million Arabic-speaking viewers, may not officially be the Osama bin Laden Channel -- but he is clearly its star, as I learned during an extended viewing of the station's programming in October. The channel's graphics assign him a lead role: there is bin Laden seated on a mat, his submachine gun on his lap; there is bin Laden on horseback in Afghanistan, the brave knight of the Arab world. A huge, glamorous poster of bin Laden's silhouette hangs in the background of the main studio set at Al Jazeera's headquarters in Doha, the capital city of Qatar.","1562":"Both books cover events from the fall of the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul in 1992 through the Taliban's key victories in 1998, which drove opposition forces into the mountainous northeast of the country. And both are filled with the dramatic moments, ironies and political intrigues that color the Taliban's rise. We read about idiosyncratic former mujahedeen commanders like Ahmed Shah Massoud of the Northern Alliance, the legendary fighter who won over many Western journalists with his good looks, charm and apparent humble piety and who was assassinated on Sept. 9 (in an attack believed to be carried out by agents of Osama bin Laden). We hear all about the Taliban's erstwhile supporters: the Pakistani intelligence services, regional smugglers, drug kingpins, well-financed Islamic extremist organizations, Osama bin Laden and reportedly even two oil companies interested in building pipelines in Afghanistan.","1563":"11 4 *THE NEW JACKALS, by Simon Reeve.

This picked up on the repeated uses of the phrase at the embattled Defense Department regarding the air campaign in Afghanistan. Asked if he could be sure that Osama bin Laden would not try to escape to another country, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld replied: 'I can't be sure of anything in life. In the fog of war, it is a confused picture on the ground. Half of the 24 hours is darkness, there's a bit of a problem with dust in that region and weather's going to get bad soon. You can't be sure of anything.' Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, later chimed in with 'In the fog of war, things happen that you don't expect.' Twelve years before, a predecessor of his at that job, Adm. William Crowe, extended that uncertainty principle; he said that his Pentagon officers 'hear a lot about the fog of war, but they've also learned that the fog of peacetime is rather mind-boggling as well.'","1568":"The astonishment at the rapid turn of events was palpable. Just as Americans were staggered nine weeks ago to find their homeland vulnerable to terrorism on a horrifying scale, now they had reason to question old fears of frustration and quagmire. Overnight, it seemed, their allies were in Kabul, before even the Bush administration wanted them to be. A key aide to Osama bin Laden was reported dead. The Taliban were on the run. While nobody could claim that terrorism itself had been defeated, this was clearly a turning point.","1569":"Lelyveld's journey to Gaza, Cairo and Hamburg in search of what made Sept. 11 possible is thought-provoking but seems incomplete. Because Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 airplane hijackers were apparently born and reared in Saudi Arabia, I believe that including the perspective of young Saudis would also have been relevant.","1570":"Just three years ago, Khartoum was on the receiving end of American missile attacks, a response to the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 for which Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda were blamed.","1571":"At the same time, after a meeting of the National Security Council conducted from President Bush's ranch here this morning, the administration also vowed to vigorously prosecute the war against remaining Taliban holdouts. It pledged, as well, to refocus its efforts on crushing Al Qaeda, the terrorist network, and its surviving leaders, who apparently include Osama bin Laden.","1572":"But the Sept. 11 attacks have focused new attention on the family, not least because the ideology of Osama bin Laden is rooted in the Arabian peninsula, his hatreds at least partly inspired by close military and other ties between the royals and the United States. Furthermore, tensions between the cost of the family and the needs of the people always rise at a time of sinking oil prices, like those seen in the last week.","1573":"The filmmakers also interview Ahmed Shah Massoud, the 'lion of Panjshir,' a mujahedeen leader killed on Sept. 9 by assassins believed to be associates of Osama bin Laden. Vikram Parekh, a researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights Watch, admires the film but is troubled by its uncritical stance toward Massoud's Northern Alliance. 'The film shows people who are victims of indiscriminate bombing by the Taliban,' he said. 'But it never mentions that Massoud's forces had also carried out such attacks on Kabul, without regard for civilian casualties.' Though the Taliban's record of human rights violations far outweighs that of the Northern Alliance, 'all sides have committed abuses,' he said. 'And neither has demonstrated a popular mandate to govern.'","1574":"Last week, the Pentagon released its first formal estimates of the cost thus far of waging war in Afghanistan. The biggest expense: $634 million to deploy more than 50,000 American soldiers, sailors and airmen, three carrier battle groups and more than 400 aircraft into the region. As the United States dispatches more ground troops to hunt down Osama bin Laden, secure and rebuild Afghan airports, and help deliver humanitarian aid, the price of the conflict is expected to rise even beyond the estimated $1 billion a month price tag. Following is brief per-item, per-hour look at why Enduring Freedom doesn't come cheap. JAMES DAO","1575":"It was an important break. But the names and address -- Marienstrasse 54 -- suddenly seemed familiar, German investigators say, and then they realized why: in 1998 and 1999, they had those same men and that same apartment under surveillance because of suspected links to an operative for Osama bin Laden.","1577":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 18\u2014 With the rapid collapse of the Taliban, the United States has intensified its pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his network, adding more commandos to the chase and aiming more airstrikes at hide-outs near the border with Pakistan, officials said today.","1578":"In an intriguing twist, five Yemeni women were detained on Saturday as they tried to cross into southwestern Pakistan at the Chaman border gate, United Nations and other officials said. The women were not identified, but their exit from Afghanistan is a reminder of the close links between Osama bin Laden and Yemen.","1579":"Her husband lacks such a clear mission. His friends say he is exasperated because he views himself as ideally equipped to be president at a time of crisis. Beyond that, Mr. Clinton now has to defend himself from the charge that he did not do enough to capture Osama bin Laden.","1580":"MADRID, Nov. 18\u2014 A Spanish investigative judge today formally charged eight Arab men living in Spain with participation in terrorism-related crimes, contending in an order that sent the men back to jail that he had seen considerable evidence indicating that they were members of Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda.","1581":"Mr. Woodward's attributions seem to advertise his access. An article on Oct. 11 began 'Osama bin Laden has provided an estimated $100 million in cash and military assistance to the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan over the last five years, making bin Laden the single greatest supporter of the Afghan regime, according to intelligence information presented recently to President Bush and his senior national security advisers.'","1582":"HUNTING BIN LADEN -- With the rapid collapse of the Taliban, the United States has intensified its pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his network, adding more commandos and aiming more airstrikes at hide-outs near the border with Pakistan.

As that is accomplished, we turn to what the Bush people call 'Phase II' -- the dangerously unfinished business of eliminating the threat from nuclear and biological weapons in Iraq. Baghdad is now the world center of state terrorism. Only Saddam has both the capacity and the demonstrated will to destroy entire cities and launch worldwide epidemics.","1584":"The Kremlin has branded all rebels as terrorists and waged a publicity campaign to link them to Islamic extremist groups, including Al Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden.","1585":"From the western part of the country to the east, control of the strategic cities passed in less than a week to the same warlords who fled from the Taliban up to six years ago. The relatively popular Ismail Khan reinstalled himself as the governor of Herat, a cultural and trading center; the ruthless Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum is back in power in northern Mazar-i-Sharif; and Haji Abdul Qadir, who let Osama bin Laden stay in his province in 1996, emerged as the victor this weekend after the Taliban fled the southern center of Jalalabad.","1586":"For most Americans there is no more frightening threat than terrorists with nuclear weapons. Assuming Osama bin Laden does not already have them -- the assumption most experts make -- everything possible must be done to prevent him or other terrorists from obtaining them.","1587":"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell applauded the agreement, but cautioned that the war was hardly over and that there were other objectives to be won -- snaring Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's elusive ruler; capturing Osama bin Laden, and destroying his Al Qaeda network in about 60 countries.","1588":"CONDOLEEZZA RICE on whether U.S. troops expect to kill Osama bin Laden or capture him for trial.

Up to $25 million reward is being offered for information leading to the location or capture of Osama bin Laden or Aiman al-Zawahiri. These two terrorists of Al Qaeda are responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent people around the world.","1592":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 19\u2014 The United States stepped up its efforts to persuade the Afghan people to turn over Osama bin Laden, as American military aircraft began broadcasting a radio message into the country announcing a $25 million cash reward for information leading to his location or capture.","1593":"LAST REDOUBTS -- Taliban forces were still holding out in Kunduz, in the north, and Kandahar, the southern city where the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was believed to be hiding. There had been talk in Afghanistan of letting Mullah Omar go if Kandahar was surrendered, but Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said no. American special forces combed mountains, caves and valleys southeast of Kandahar, but did not find Osama bin Laden. American bombs continued to fall around Kunduz, but Northern Alliance troops besieging the city suspended their ground assault and tried to persuade thousands of defenders -- mostly foreigners who fanatically support the Taliban cause -- to give up.","1594":"'The people of the world may not like some of the things we do, and Osama bin Laden may hate us,' Ms. Hasan said, 'but we can show them by having the Eid stamp sell out that diversity and difference are our strengths.'","1595":"Although Mr. Bolton said that Osama bin Laden 'could have been trying to acquire a rudimentary biological weapons capability, possibly with support from a state,' he said he would not now name any countries that had assisted him.","1596":"RADIO MESSAGE -- American military aircraft began broadcasting a new radio message into Afghanistan announcing a $25 million cash reward for information leading to the location or capture of Osama bin Laden and eight Al Qaeda members.

A few years later, her office undertook a criminal investigation of Osama bin Laden and his terror network, Al Qaeda. Her prosecutors have announced 10 criminal indictments of Mr. bin Laden and his followers and won the convictions of four of them in a terrorism conspiracy case that stemmed from the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa.","1598":"In the week since the Spanish police arrested suspected members of the cell, international attention has focused on Spain's role as an apparent staging area for Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization. It is known that Mr. Atta visited the country twice, his second trip last July. In addition, another Spain-based cell thought to have played a central role in an attempt to blow up the American Embassy in Paris was recently dismantled, officials say.","1599":"MILITARY -- The United States is prepared to send additional ground forces to capture or kill Osama bin Laden if intelligence pinpoints his location, Pentagon officials said. A1","1600":"It was Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia who urged backing for the Taliban. Wahhabism is, like the ideology of the Taliban, a retrograde strain of Islam that is obsessed with the question of purity. So extreme is this purist creed that it views all non-Muslims (as well as non-Wahhabi Muslims like myself) as a form of 'pollution' of the entire 'land of Muhammad,' the phrase that Osama bin Laden uses when he talks about the presence of the American military forces in Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden not only grew up with this ideology, the staple of the Saudi school system, but he turned it against his own regime when it violated these principles during the gulf war.","1601":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20\u2014 The seven-week military campaign in Afghanistan has given the world a stark view of a new American doctrine to make war on the sources of terrorism in the world. But with the defeat of the Taliban perhaps only days away and the hunt for Osama bin Laden intensifying, the force of the American destruction of Afghan targets has sent an unambiguous warning far beyond the war theater to a number of nations that continue to provide bases and training to terrorist groups. The warning is: this could happen to you.","1602":"The war against the Taliban, the campaign against terrorism around the world, and the hunt for Osama bin Laden have all become interlocked puzzle pieces as Afghanistan teeters under the American-led assault. Where American ground troops go from here -- as soldiers, and as de facto law-enforcement agents searching for a wanted man -- is one issue. How the military campaign is perceived by governments outside Afghanistan that continue to harbor terrorists is a question that will resonate far longer.","1603":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 20\u2014 The United States is prepared to send additional ground forces to capture or kill Osama bin Laden if intelligence pinpoints his location, now believed to be somewhere in a lawless corridor of former Taliban territory between Kandahar and Jalalabad in southeastern Afghanistan, Pentagon officials said today.","1604":"While the United States and its allies have yet to defeat fully the Taliban or Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization, officials said they had begun preparing a blueprint for reconstruction because nations were more likely to pledge large amounts of money now than later, before so-called donor fatigue sets in.","1605":"Washington is understandably preoccupied with the pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his supporters. But it is critically important to stabilize the situation in Kabul by sending in foreign peacekeeping troops and establishing an interim governing authority. If the capital and its environs can be secured, Afghans in surrounding regions will be more likely to participate in a power-sharing arrangement elsewhere. Political leaders in Kabul must reach out beyond the Northern Alliance forces to include representatives of the ethnic Pashtun population in the city and in southern Afghanistan.","1606":"Photos: A translated example of leaflets dropped in Afghanistan offering a bounty for Osama bin Laden and a top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Abdul Rashid Dostum is back in power; and Haji Abdul Qadir, who allowed Osama bin Laden to stay in his province in 1996, filled the vacuum created by the Taliban's retreat from Jalalabad last week.","1611":"Our concern for Pakistani stability and Muslim opinion would restrain us if Osama bin Laden crossed the border into Pakistan. Such restraints are no more or less than considerations to take into account in formulating and carrying out our strategy.","1612":"THE MULLAH AND THE TERRORIST -- Interviews with intelligence officials in Pakistan and Kabul present a picture of a growing closeness between Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's spiritual leader. B1","1613":"Mr. Bush said at the Army base here that 27 of 30 Afghan provinces were no longer controlled by the Taliban and that United States and rebel forces had cut terrorists' lines of communications. But he warned that military victory would now come more slowly as commandos hunted Osama bin Laden.","1614":"Taliban leaders pitched the idea to the Pakistanis two days ago. According to a Pakistani government official in Islamabad, the siege of Kunduz is especially sensitive because the relatives of some of the country's most powerful religious leaders are apparently trapped there. Northern Alliance officials say the group includes several members of Al Qaeda, the militant organization headed by Osama bin Laden.","1615":"Mr. Bush said at the Army base here that 27 of 30 Afghan provinces were no longer controlled by the Taliban and that United States and rebel forces had cut terrorists' lines of communications. But he warned that military victory would now come more slowly as commandos hunted Osama bin Laden.","1616":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 21\u2014 In a reception room at a Taliban ministry of defense building in Kabul, a brightly colored map depicting the American military presence in the Arabian peninsula was painted on a wall. An identical map appears in a book written by Osama bin Laden declaring a holy war on the United States.","1617":"HIGH-TECH WEAPONRY -- The American forces, in any case, were more interested in the hunt for Osama bin Laden than in the fate of the lost warriors of Kunduz. With Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters still resisting in Kandahar and other pockets, the military added even more warplanes to the potent armada already in play.","1618":"American forces seeking the hide-outs of Osama bin Laden are being equipped with sophisticated new technology -- an array of sensors -- that can pierce darkness, bad weather and as much as 100 feet of solid rock, homing in on heat, magnetic fields, vibrations and other faint cues.","1619":"A man convicted in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania and also accused of assisting in an attack on a Manhattan jail guard has been transferred to a federal prison nicknamed Super Max for its high security, records show. The prison, in Florence, Colo., has held Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomber. The embassy bomber, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, above, was one of four men who received life sentences last month for their roles in a conspiracy to kill Americans. Prosecutors said the conspiracy was led by Osama bin Laden. Mr. Mohamed has denied any role in the attack on the guard. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","1620":"Al Qaeda's best hide-outs near here have been bombed several times by the United States, as have the Taliban's military bases. The withdrawal of the Taliban from all but southern Afghanistan gave rise to hopes that the movement, and with it Osama bin Laden's political cover, would soon vanish.","1621":"And one was downright alarming about the state of American television. 'Two networks are helping mass murderers,' President Bush appeared to say in a denunciation of Osama bin Laden.","1622":"One intelligence official said that Juma Namangani, the field commander of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which seeks to transform all of Central Asia into a single militant Islamic state, was believed to have been killed somewhere in northern Afghanistan. This reportedly happened several days before the death of Mohammed Atef, a senior lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a bombing raid last week.","1623":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 21\u2014 Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief said today that his government had seen no evidence that the Iraqi government had provided support to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. He said Saudi Arabia would not support making Iraq a military target of the war on terrorism.","1624":"But throughout most of the Muslim world, the tension between Islam and modernity remains profound. Indeed, some observers have suggested since Sept. 11 that it is the absence of a Reformation in the history of Islam that helps explain why universities in the Arab world that were once the most advanced centers of learning have often turned inward and backward. It appears clear that some of the resonance of Osama bin Laden's appeal to the Arab masses lies in the very fact that those masses have little alternative means of political expression.","1625":"For Americans, Osama bin Laden is a mass murderer. But for many young Arabs, bin Laden, even in defeat, is still Robin Hood. What attracts them to him is not his vision of the ideal Muslim society, which few would want to live in. No, what attracts them to him is his sheer defiance of everything young Arabs and Muslims detest their hypocritical rulers, Israel, U.S. dominance and their own economic backwardness. He is still the finger in the eye of the world that so many frustrated, powerless people out here would love to poke.","1626":"THE MANHUNT -- The American military continued its systematic hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan by working down a target list of cave complexes suspected of hiding Osama bin Laden, focusing particularly on areas south of Kandahar, the largest Taliban stronghold still resisting opposition forces. A1","1627":"Edward Rothstein ('Exploring the Flaws in the Notion of the 'Root Causes' of Terror,' Arts &amp; Ideas pages, Nov. 17) suggests that poverty and injustice cannot be considered among the root causes of Islamic terrorism because Osama bin Laden is a multimillionaire. By that logic, slavery could not have caused the Civil War because Abraham Lincoln was not a slave.","1628":"Encouraging governments to provide good education and health services to their citizens could help dry up the source of people willing to carry out the bidding of totalitarians like Osama bin Laden.","1629":"A no-holds-barred investigation into intelligence lapses could be perilous for Republicans and Democrats alike. If the inquiry focused on why the United States did not take the threat from Osama bin Laden more seriously before Sept. 11, officials from the Bush administration and the Clinton administration could find themselves on the defensive.","1630":"Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, co-equal on America's most-wanted list with Osama bin Laden, is partial to Chevrolet Suburbans with darkened windows. Mr. bin Laden, like many of the sheiks and princes of Saudi Arabia among whom he grew up, likes Toyota Land Cruisers, as did his military commander, Muhammad Atef, a former Egyptian policeman who is believed to have been killed by American bombing last week.","1631":"Just last week, a Predator operated by the Central Intelligence Agency was used to coordinate the surgical strike in which one of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenants was killed, administration officials said.","1632":"The Northern Alliance fighters whom the filmmakers talk to -- including Ahmed Shah Massoud, the legendary Lion of the Panjshir who was assassinated in September by men said to be linked to Osama bin Laden -- are as ruthless and determined as their unseen foes. They see themselves as holy warriors fighting a patriotic battle against an enemy they describe as the tool of Pakistan, Britain and the United States. One imagines that -- at least in terms of the latter two -- their thinking has changed recently.","1633":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22\u2014 The American military continued its systematic hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan by working down a target list of cave networks where Osama bin Laden is suspected to be hiding, officials said today.","1634":"Pakistan had been a close ally of the Taliban until the government's supreme leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, rejected its advice to turn over Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","1635":"FOG OF WAR -- An alliance warlord, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, said he had agreed with a senior Taliban commander on the surrender of thousands of Taliban fighters in Kunduz, starting on Saturday. But later, the alliance's interior minister, Yunus Qanooni, said a military solution was being pursued rather than a negotiated one. Had there been a deal or not? Given rifts in the leadership of the alliance, it was anybody's guess. Taliban negotiators may not have spoken for all the trapped forces. Afghan troops may have been ready to give up, but not the thousands of foreigners -- Pakistanis, Arabs and Chechens devoted to Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda -- who have vowed to fight to the death. That is what Washington wants anyway. As in all wars, guns speak louder than words.","1636":"NEW HAVEN\u2014 If we should capture Osama bin Laden or his accomplices in the days ahead, where should we try them? Two unsound proposals have recently emerged. The first, and by far more dangerous, is already law: the president's misguided and much criticized order authorizing secret trials before an American military commission. The second, more benign approach, offered by prominent international lawyers, is to try terrorists before an as yet uncreated international tribunal.","1637":"In conversations here, many Saudis have in fact pointed instead to the presence of some 5,000 American troops in the kingdom as the main reason for anti-American resentment. That presence, in a kingdom that is home to Islam's two holiest cites, has been cited repeatedly by Osama bin Laden, whose Saudi citizenship was revoked in 1994, and by some militant Saudi clerics as the main justification in their calls for a holy war against the United States and its Saudi allies.","1638":"'I am writing this will while in front of me, four meters away, are Sheik Osama and his first deputy, Sheik Abu Hafas al-Masri, and the second deputy, Sheik Ayman al-Zawahiri,' the author wrote, referring to Osama bin Laden and two of his top lieutenants. 'Thanks to the kindness of God, I am passing my life with these people who are like lions against the infidels.'","1639":"We have also learned how close Taliban leaders were to Osama bin Laden, preaching his hatred and following his orders. Taliban soldiers, including tens of thousands of foreign volunteers, have to be taken seriously as a potential terrorist army.","1640":"They said the fighters had also established bases at two locations in the vicinity of Jalalabad in northeastern Afghanistan, within 40 miles of the Pakistan border. Rumors are rife in Jalalabad that the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden may be among them, possibly in an area of jagged ridges called Tora Bora.","1642":"More than nine hours westward, the first hijacked plane had struck the World Trade Center, and the second struck shortly after Ms. Chamberlin began watching. That it was terrorism was certain, and that it had momentous implications for the United States' strained relationship with Pakistan seemed just as clear -- at least to American officials like Ms. Chamberlin, 53, whose experience in counterterrorism made Osama bin Laden an immediate suspect.","1643":"The Rev. Jesse Jackson made the list for remarking to an audience at Harvard Law School that America should 'build bridges and relationships, not simply bombs and walls.' Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle Eastern history at Stanford University, earned a place on it for his opinion that 'If Osama bin Laden is confirmed to be behind the attacks, the United States should bring him before an international tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity.' And Wasima Alikhan of the Islamic Academy of Las Vegas was there simply for saying 'Ignorance breeds hate.'","1645":"This kind of high-handedness and secrecy has been a hallmark of the administration beginning Jan. 20, not Sept. 11. The Cheney energy task force faced a lawsuit from the General Accounting Office rather than reveal its dealings with Bush-Cheney campaign contributors like those at the now imploding Enron Corporation. The president's commission on Social Security reform also bent the law to meet in secret. But since the war began, the administration has gone to unprecedented lengths to restrict news coverage of not only its own activities but also Osama bin Laden's. A Bush executive order diminishing access to presidential papers could restrict a future David McCullough or Michael Beschloss from reconstructing presidential histories. To consolidate his own power, Mr. Ashcroft even seized authority from Mary Jo White, the battle-proven U.S. attorney who successfully prosecuted both the 1993 World Trade Center terrorists and the bin Laden accomplices in the 1998 African embassy bombings. He has similarly shunted aside state and local law-enforcement officials by keeping them in the dark before issuing his vague warnings of imminent terrorist attacks.","1646":"DIGGING IN -- If Pakistani intelligence officials are right, non-Afghan fighters for the Taliban were digging in near Kabul, the Afghan capital, and also at two locations outside Jalalabad, in the country's northeast. Rumors spread that Osama bin Laden was with them -- not near Kandahar in the south, as generally assumed, but in an area of jagged ridges called Tora Bora. It was hard to tell what to believe. But about 800 American Special Operations forces were said to be massed in Pakistan, ready to enter Afghanistan to find Mr. bin Laden and kill him.","1647":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 23\u2014 With Taliban troops establishing strong pockets of resistance across a wide swath of Afghanistan, the United States is using two bases in Pakistan to send in several hundred Special Operations forces in an attempt to kill Taliban troops and capture Osama bin Laden.","1648":"'No country in Europe could extradite detainees to the United States if there were any chance they would be put before these military tribunals,' said the prosecutor, who is helping to coordinate the criminal procedures against the eight men, whom prosecutors believe to be associates of Osama bin Laden.","1649":"HOLDING OUT -- With Taliban troops unexpectedly establishing pockets of resistance across a wide swath of Afghanistan, the United States is using two bases in Pakistan to send in several hundred American Special Operations forces in an attempt to kill Taliban troops and capture Osama bin Laden.

No hunt has attracted more media attention and a greater sum than the quest for Osama bin Laden for his role in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The government is offering a reward of up to $25 million for information leading to the capture of Mr. bin Laden and his senior officers.","1654":"But Bradley Ortman, Mr. Refai's lawyer, said that investigators have cleared Mr. Refai of having connections to terrorists. According to newspaper accounts, investigators apparently have decided that the documents from Arkansas involved a case of mistaken identity, the cigarette lighters were just trinkets and Osama bin Laden was not the Osama proposed as his child's namesake. Mr. Refai has told investigators the videos were vacation shots.","1655":"Acting on information from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Yemeni security police have begun to pick up suspects for interrogation in what the interior minister calls an 'ongoing operation.' Although authorities here would not be more specific, they said that at least one known member of Al Qaeda, the terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden, had been among those identified by the C.I.A. and arrested.","1656":"Jonathan Rosen is right. Osama bin Laden would seek to destroy Israel and the United States even if the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza ended tomorrow. But America is not seeking to win over the bin Ladens. The success of our war against terrorism may depend on a coalition that includes millions of Muslims, who do indeed care about the West Bank and Gaza.","1657":"At San Diego State University, an Ethiopian-born student fluent in Arabic, Zewdalem Kebede, received a disciplinary warning for criticizing three students he said he overheard in the university library praising Osama bin Laden in Arabic for the Sept. 11 attacks.","1658":"One of the most chilling of the wave of books that speak to the Sept. 11 attacks is a careful and exhaustive study of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. 'Study of Revenge,' which was published last year but has been reissued, with a new introduction by the former director of central intelligence R. James Woolsey, makes a powerful case for Iraqi involvement in the first World Trade Center attack. Laurie Mylroie has combed through the court documents of the case and pieced together a series of connections with Iraq that prosecutors, concerned only with indicting those on trial, ignored. Unfortunately, it was not just the prosecutors who failed to heed the warning signs. Mylroie's research challenges the widespread belief that rogue networks of terrorists run by Islamic radicals like Osama bin Laden work without state sponsorship. Saddam Hussein, she argues, driven by a desire for revenge following the gulf war, is the single greatest terrorist threat to the United States. The decision by the Clinton administration to duck the question of Iraqi involvement in the 1993 bombing may well, according to Mylroie, have led to a series of later terrorist strikes, including the 1998 bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500. If she is correct, the Sept. 11 attacks, along with other incidents like the 1996 bombing of the Al Khobar base in Saudi Arabia that left 19 American servicemen dead, were the inevitable consequence of an administration and an intelligence service that has spent the last decade asleep at the wheel. Chris Hedges","1659":"They are all children of parents born in the Middle East who have become American citizens. All three said they had been approached since the attacks by fellow classmates and officers with wide-ranging questions. Some asked about Koran passages; others wondered if Osama bin Laden was really from a wealthy family.

Surveys by the Drug Enforcement Administration showed that most of the heroin in American drug markets came from Colombia and Mexico. The State Department was wary about working with the Taliban on any issue, given its poor human rights record and its hospitality toward Osama bin Laden. So too were officials in northern Europe, even though their cities were awash in Afghan heroin.","1663":"WITH the Taliban badly battered in Afghanistan, and Osama bin Laden on the run, the biggest parlor game in Washington has now boiled down to one question: What will Phase II of the war look like?","1664":"Abu Sayyaf is fighting for a separate Islamic state in the south of the Philippines.

He is still on the loose. But he was reportedly seen this week at a well-fortified encampment near Tora Bora, deep in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. An Afghan official in that region, Hazarat Ali, said his sources tell him that Mr. bin Laden sleeps in caves and moves at night on horseback. How reliable are these sources? 'I trust them like my mother or father,' Mr. Ali said.","1669":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Nov. 24\u2014 Osama bin Laden was seen this week at a large and well-fortified encampment 35 miles southwest of this city, a minister of the self-proclaimed government here said tonight.","1670":"It is in a place like Zhawar, a mountain base called Tora Bora also near the Pakistan border, that the Afghan rumor mill now says Osama bin Laden is hiding with some 1,200 Taliban troops.","1671":"If Osama bin Laden is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, as American officials suspect, he has plenty to choose from. The country's varied landscape and geology make it ideal for caves.","1673":"One reason is that America's mission in Afghanistan is far from accomplished. Osama bin Laden and many top aides remain at large, Taliban fighters still hold out in the countryside and a few urban redoubts, and the creation of a stable post-Taliban government has barely begun. Until these basic objectives are achieved, Afghanistan will remain a potential base for international terrorism.","1674":"Tom Whalen, another police officer who signed the flag, said in an interview that he wanted to send a message to Osama bin Laden. So he wrote: 'Benny, may the last breath you take be spent looking at this flag.'","1675":"SENDING IN THE MARINES -- If Kunduz did indeed fall, Kandahar is now the lone Taliban stronghold. Outside that city, hundreds of marines poured in, the front edge of a 1,000-man force said likely to join the hunt for Osama bin Laden and then go after remaining Taliban troops. The marines' arrival fills a need for fighters who can conduct sustained assaults -- who, in the words of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, can 'crawl around on the ground and find people.'","1676":"While the Taliban home base of Kandahar and the hunt for Osama bin Laden will continue to be the focus of American attention, a vast majority of Afghans will be watching negotiations that start in Germany on Tuesday and that could determine whether their country reverts to civil war or unites in a new era of stability.","1677":"The marines were to be the front edge of a powerful force of more than 1,000 combat troops who, the officials said, are likely to join the hunt for Osama bin Laden within days and then begin raids against Taliban forces concentrated in Kandahar and in mountain redoubts near the border with Pakistan.","1678":"THE CAVES -- If Osama bin Laden is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, as American officials suspect, he has plenty to choose from. The country's varied landscape and geology make it ideal for caves. B4","1679":"After Sept. 11, Mr. Arnett found himself a war correspondent without a network, even though he has more experience than most television reporters covering the front lines of this war. His career spans almost every major conflict of the last 40 years, including Vietnam, where his reporting for The Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize, and Afghanistan, where he interviewed Osama bin Laden.","1680":"The man, Agus Budiman, is charged with helping another man, Mohammad bin Nasser Belfas, obtain a false Virginia driver's license. The charge itself is apparently unconnected to the attacks, but both men are mentioned on an F.B.I. list of people sought for questioning in the investigation. Mr. Belfas is identified on the list as a contact person for Osama bin Laden.","1682":"Europe 1 said that one of those detained today, a Tunisian, was an associate of Osama bin Laden, Washington's prime suspect in the terrorist attacks in the United States that took place two days after Mr. Massoud was fatally injured.","1683":"The gains were the most significant ones made by the disparate tribal groups, whose cooperation the United States regards as critical in its campaign against the Taliban and in its hunt for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda members in the mountains and caves along the Pakistan border.","1684":"The alert referred to a threat based on information that suggested that Osama bin Laden had approved a plan for his followers to attack gas supplies in the United States. 'Such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed,' the warning said.","1685":"IN SPAIN -- Police officers carrying out surveillance of two Islamic terror cells tied to Osama bin Laden saw the groups' leaders talking on a Madrid street two weeks before Sept. 11. The police believe the meeting was a furtive attempt to coordinate the groups' actions. B6","1686":"Other than this warning, the president gave no further hint of what course the war might take should Osama bin Laden be captured or killed and his Al Qaeda network be destroyed in Afghanistan.","1687":"She said she tried to persuade the more moderate Taliban leaders to prevent the destruction of Buddhist temples last spring. Long before that, she said, she tried to explain that they had to turn over Osama bin Laden. To this day, she argues that the Taliban were not in league with him but that their leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was too proud and primitive to break tribal rules of hospitality or surrender to American demands.","1688":"The job was not expected to be easy. Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, was believed to be rallying his troops for a last stand. Osama bin Laden, on the other hand, 'seems to be concentrating on hiding,' General Myers said.","1689":"The primary remaining military objectives are to uproot the Taliban from Kandahar, their original stronghold and last center of power, and to hunt down Osama bin Laden and his fellow terrorists. Both goals must be achieved in the ethnic Pashtun regions of southern and eastern Afghanistan where the Northern Alliance, made up largely of non-Pashtun minority groups, cannot be as useful a military partner as it was in the north. The brunt of the fighting in this phase of the war is likely to be borne by the marines. President Bush warned Americans yesterday to 'be prepared for loss of life.' To minimize casualties, the Pentagon must be as smart and creative in developing battlefield tactics as it has been in other areas of Afghanistan.","1690":"About 500 marines dug in today at a primitive desert airstrip less than 80 miles southwest of Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold, but still within easy helicopter striking distance of the city. Officials said the Marine vanguard, along with another 500 marines who were expected to land Tuesday, will intercept military traffic, cut off escape routes for enemy fighters and, given credible intelligence, strike at leaders of the Taliban and at Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda.","1691":"The videotape was the first shown of the couple, Gracia and Martin Burnham, since they were taken captive with 18 others in May by Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, who have been linked to Osama bin Laden.","1692":"In October, Anne Patterson, the American ambassador, compared the group to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.","1693":"The Pentagon lacks a strong proxy ground force in the south and has a more demanding mission there: to take the fight to the adversary's heartland and roust Osama bin Laden, his Qaeda fighters and the Taliban from their sanctuaries and pursue them, even if they flee into caves and mountains that make Afghanistan one of the most rugged places in the world.","1694":"MADRID, Nov. 26\u2014 Police officers carrying out surveillance of two Spain-based Islamic terror cells working in Osama bin Laden's network saw the groups' two leaders approach each other on a Madrid street, shake hands and carry on a conversation in what the police believe was intended to be a clandestine meeting.","1695":"Mr. Ashcroft seemed irked with the complaints about the Justice Department's withholding details. He said he was not releasing the names of those charged with immigration violations because that would aid Osama bin Laden by revealing which associates were in custody.","1696":"Also on the list were two men arrested last month at Kennedy International Airport on charges they tried to smuggle $140,000 in cash to Yemen, most of it hidden in boxes of honey. The arrests came just days after federal officials froze the assets of several honey businesses in Yemen, saying they were tied to Osama bin Laden. The two men, Ali Alfatimi and Basam Nahshal, are still being detained.","1697":"SEEKING BIN LADEN -- As ever, the big prize for the United States is finding Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda disciples. Offering their most explicit details to date, senior Pentagon officials said the hunt was focused on the region around Kandahar, in the Afghan south, and along a mountainous, cave-dotted stretch in the east, between Kabul and the Khyber Pass. To make the point more forcefully, American warplanes bombed a compound southeast of Kandahar said to have been used by the Taliban, Al Qaeda and others. No doubt, people were killed, officials in Washington said. The tantalizing question was who. Too early to tell, the officials said.","1698":"Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has indicated that it was unlikely that the United States would be part of a formal peacemaking or peacekeeping force after Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his terrorist organization, were defeated.","1699":"But Prince Walid's remarks were extraordinarily bold by the standards of Saudi Arabia, where criticism of the royal family is prohibited -- and where some officials have continued to dismiss as unproven the idea of Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, for which the United States holds the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden responsible.","1700":"Attorney General John Ashcroft said this week that the F.B.I. issued a warning to its field offices that terrorists might attack natural gas supplies if Osama bin Laden were killed or captured in Afghanistan.","1701":"The house, like others in the Afghan capital apparently used by Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda, seems to have been hastily abandoned when the Taliban fled Kabul two weeks ago. It is not clear who may have been in the house since then, or whether the littered papers and rough sketches may have been left by someone else.","1702":"Officials said they did not know whether Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban, or Osama bin Laden was present at the compound when it was struck.","1703":"The measure sailed through the House 408 to 6 after reports linked Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda, to the African diamond trade, which is also thought to a major cause of civil wars in sub-Saharan Africa.","1704":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Nov. 28\u2014 American forces have enlisted commanders in eastern Afghanistan to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hide-outs south of this city, a senior minister of the regional government said today.","1705":"LONDON, Nov. 28\u2014 A High Court judge ruled today that a man identified in court testimony in the United States as a terrorist and ally of Osama bin Laden is entitled to the 'bare necessities' of life. The ruling potentially undermined the British government's effort to snare the suspect in a financial stranglehold.","1706":"Many C.I.A. officers in the field are paramilitary operatives from the agency's Special Activities Division inside the Directorate of Operations. Others are from the agency's Counterterrorism Center, which has led the C.I.A.'s investigation of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","1707":"German officials have said recently that at least 10 people, mainly students and businessmen of Arab background, are under investigation for suspected contacts with the Hamburg hijackers cell. But investigators have been hampered by German laws that prevent authorities from making arrests without serious suspicion of illegal activity. Thus, while a wave of arrests of Arab men suspected of ties to the Qaeda network of Osama bin Laden has swept a number of European countries since Sept. 11, this was the first arrest in Germany.","1708":"Despite reports that the Taliban prisoners who staged the uprising had not been adequately searched for weapons, Mr. Spann placed blame for his son's death on only one person: Osama bin Laden.","1709":"SEARCHING FOR BIN LADEN -- American forces have enlisted commanders in eastern Afghanistan to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hideouts. B2","1710":"'My actions appeared justified,' the general told the court, adding that he would do the same again today 'if it were against Osama bin Laden.'","1711":"At the same time, anti-Taliban commanders in eastern Afghanistan said that they had been enlisted by the American military to help search for Osama bin Laden in isolated mountain hide-outs. [Page B2.]","1712":"One faction belongs to Yunis Khalis, who helped expel the Soviets in 1989 and welcomed Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan five years ago. He has one foot in the camp of the new government in these parts, and one still planted with the Taliban.","1713":"In his testimony, Mr. Chertoff introduced a new explanation for the department's detention of about 600 men, on criminal and immigration charges. He said it was intended, in part, to catch and disable what he called 'sleeper' agents Osama bin Laden might have sent to the United States.","1714":"Court TV's big story this week followed the closing arguments in the case of Richard Sharpe, described as the 'cross-dressing dermatologist' from Massachusetts. He said he was insane when he killed his wife. But tonight at 10 on its regular series 'The System,' Court TV plugs into larger events with 'Osama bin Laden on Trial,' a contemplation of how 'the world's most wanted' might be prosecuted and defended in an American courtroom.","1715":"ADDING PRESSURE -- The goal, of course, is to deliver a final blow to Osama bin Laden and the remnants of his Taliban shield, believed to have taken refuge near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and across a stretch of terrain east and south of Kabul, the capital. 'We're going to continue to apply pressure,' General Franks said.","1716":"The order is described as if it is aimed only at Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders. A former deputy attorney general, George J. Terwilliger III, said the masterminds of the Sept. 11 attacks 'don't deserve constitutional protection.'","1717":"Abdullah Omar Abdel Rahman said that his brothers never belonged to the Qaeda network, and that he had never heard from them that they had any relationship with its leader, Osama bin Laden. He said Ahmed made his living in Afghanistan by selling used cars, while Muhammad worked as a trader.","1718":"Although he has never advocated the killing of prisoners, comments like one he made about taking Osama bin Laden dead or alive -- 'I have my preference,' Mr. Rumsfeld said -- have been criticized for the signal they might send to Afghan warlords.","1719":"A federal judge in Brooklyn yesterday dismissed charges against two men accused of smuggling more than $140,000 in cash to Yemen, most of it hidden in a shipment of honey. The charges were dismissed without prejudice, allowing prosecutors to reinstate the charges within five years. Federal authorities had identified several honey businesses in Yemen that they said were linked to Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda. Prosecutors sought the dismissal of the charges, which were brought last month. The men, Ali Al-Fatimi and Basam Nashal, had been held without bail. Yesterday, Mr. Al-Fatimi was released. Mr Nashal, 22, who had been on probation in an unrelated state case, was being held for a court appearance in that case today. Prosecutors would not say why they had asked that the charges be dismissed. Mr. Nashal's lawyer, Trevor L. Headley, said his client did not know there was money in the boxes of honey. Mr. Al-Fatimi's lawyer could not be reached for comment.","1720":"Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chief deputy Republican whip in the House, announced the proposal yesterday at a news conference attended by several relatives of those who died on Aug. 7, 1998, in the coordinated attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which have been attributed to associates of Osama bin Laden. Twelve Americans died in the attacks.","1721":"MILAN, Nov. 29\u2014 The Italian police raided two mosques here early today and arrested two men accused of recruiting fighters for Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. A warrant was issued for a third man who is believed to be in Afghanistan, and the police disclosed that a fourth man has been in detention for two weeks.","1722":"If the military tribunals do come to pass, administration officials have an idea of whom they would like to see in the dock -- besides Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants, of course. A good example, some at the White House said, is one Ahmed Abdel Rahman, who was credibly reported to have been captured by Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. He is hardly the grand prize, American military officials said, but a good catch all the same.","1723":"At the White House, Mr. Fleischer likened the program that would give special immigration status to foreigners who provide information about terrorism to federal offers of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of a wanted suspect. (There is a $25 million reward for information leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden.) But in this case, in lieu of cash, the government is offering the right to stay in the United States and perhaps the prospect of obtaining a green card.","1724":"'Patrick Cuffy realized that three things could get him his freedom,' said Dwight L. Thomas, another lawyer for Mr. Dorsey. He could reveal the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden or Eric Robert Rudolph, charged in the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Or, 'third, to say that Sidney Dorsey told him to do this. He chose the latter.'","1725":"Since the United States began its offensive against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, Uzbekistan, which borders Afghanistan, has become a new strategic ally of the United States.","1726":"Mr. Namangani, an exile from Uzbekistan who is thought to have been killed near here, was a co-founder of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which helped destabilize three nations and whose guerrilla successes won him the attention and support of Osama bin Laden. Last month President Bush put the movement on a list of terrorist organizations whose assets would be frozen.","1727":"He laughed uproariously and said: 'You've got to be kidding. I'm proud of it.' Later, he was asked his opinion of the rumor that Osama bin Laden had made the short list for Time magazine's man of the year award. 'There is only one list that Osama bin Laden should be on,' he said, to laughter. Everyone got what he meant. But it can't be printed here.","1728":"Other senior officials in Washington have suggested that the marines could launch lightning raids, but said they were not likely to mount cave-to-cave searches for Osama bin Laden or his lieutenants.","1729":"VILLAGES ARE HIT -- On things perhaps going wrong, there was an American air raid over Tora Bora, the cave complex in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden may be hiding. Although military officials vigorously denied missing their target, residents of nearby villages said that bombs fell on them, killing scores of civilians -- at least 70 some said, and maybe many more.","1731":"BEIRUT, Lebanon\u2014 So what comes after the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are finished? Probably more Talibans and new Osama bin Ladens. This is the sad and shocking reality that we must confront. It will happen apart from all the fanfare surrounding America's military triumph in Afghanistan and all the other achievements of this so-called war on terror. Why? Because the Taliban and Mr. bin Laden are not isolated cases but manifestations of a complex, and potentially durable, sociopolitical phenomenon.","1732":"Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the lead prosecutor in the investigation of Osama bin Laden and now the United States attorney in Chicago, is only slightly more effusive, saying having Mr. Comey follow Ms. White 'is the greatest succession in New York since Mickey Mantle took over center field from Joe DiMaggio.'","1733":"7 11 2 HOLY WAR, INC., by Peter L. Bergen. (Free Press, $26.) A television journalist's account of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.","1734":"In his administration, the internationalist camp believes that, as in the Persian Gulf War a decade ago, the American military mandate in the terror war is narrowly defined, at least initially. A decade ago the mandate was to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and today it is to destroy Osama bin Laden's main base in Afghanistan, and with it the Taliban. The way forward in confronting terrorism's broader threat, for these people, is to focus on collective action and international consensus while mediating conflicts that feed into terrorism.","1735":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 1\u2014 Witnesses and local officials said today that American bombers flying over Tora Bora, the cave complex where Osama bin Laden may be hiding, struck three nearby villages, killing dozens of civilians. But a high-ranking Pentagon official said the bombers had attacked sites 20 miles away and had only hit their targets.","1736":"ERRANT BOMBING REPORTED -- American bombers over Tora Bora, the cave complex where Osama bin Laden may be hiding, struck three Afghan villages, killing or injuring scores of civilians, witnesses and local officials said. But an American spokesman, Marine Maj. Brad Lowell, denied that American bombs had mistakenly hit a village, saying that the target struck was military. B2","1737":"What happens when you cut off the head of a terrorist organization? If Osama bin Laden, who has been Al Qaeda's founder, theoretician, financier and spokesman, is killed or captured, will it sprout new heads like the beast that fought on till Hercules cauterized every neck? Will it, as any biology student has watched, go still for a while as it grows a new head? Or are its cells so self-directed and self-supporting that it can continue waging jihad even if every leader in Afghanistan is killed or run to ground?","1738":"Since Sept. 11, Muslim leaders have repeatedly said that extremists like Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network have distorted religious teachings to justify terrorism. But beyond these now-familiar declarations that the attacks against the United States were 'not Islam,' there has been mostly silence.","1739":"One of the most troubling moves by the administration has been the secret and in some cases prolonged detention of suspects rounded up after Sept. 11. The Justice Department, which has offered a shifting series of explanations as to why this is necessary, most recently suggested that it was responding to the possibility that Osama bin Laden might have sent 'sleeper' agents to the United States. The American system does not hold with the idea of incarcerating a large group of people who it seems to have no credible reason to believe are dangerous, out of vague concern that somewhere among them might be a future law-breaker.","1740":"Few at the prayer session did stop to talk but they mentioned over and over how hurt they were that the police had failed to take their shoes off inside the center during the raid. They said they were sure the accusations of terrorist links were bogus, as were those against Osama bin Laden.","1741":"Today, Mr. Nasir lies on the floor of an abandoned home, wrapped in a dirty blanket, with an infection gnawing his limb and Northern Alliance guards debating his future. He has come a long way from his working-class home in Riyadh, and the pep talk from Osama bin Laden a few months before offers little succor now.","1744":"Ariel Sharon, the Israeli leader, has compared Mr. Arafat to Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. And, like Mr. Arafat, Mr. Sharon has little political room to make concessions for peace if he is inclined to. Israeli commentators are already mocking him for a blithe boast he made before he departed last week on a trip to the United States. He said that he could now devote most of his time to the imploding economy, because 'it appears to me that we have found the way, which won't be short and won't be easy, to stand up to and struggle against terror.' Then came the worst terror attacks in months.","1745":"CAIRO, Dec. 2\u2014 Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden and a man with a price on his head, says in excerpts from his autobiography published today that the Arabs fighting in Afghanistan, no matter what their fate, succeeded in galvanizing Muslim youth around the world in taking on the West.","1746":"If you don't want to drag Osama bin Laden to the U.S. for a circus of a trial, fine. Shoot him in his cave. Bomb him. Whatever. He's a war criminal on the loose and a genuine threat to kill thousands more at any time.","1747":"BIN LADEN AIDE -- Ayman Al-Zawahiri, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, says in his autobiography that the Arabs fighting in Afghanistan, no matter what their fate, succeeded in galvanizing Muslim youth around the world in taking on the West. The newspaper Al Sharq Al Awsat, based in London, is running excerpts from the book, 'Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet.' B4","1748":"POUNDING THE TARGETS -- While the Marines expanded the arc of their ground patrols in the region, bombers continued to pound targets from the air -- in particular the area near Tora Bora where Osama bin Laden is thought to be holed up.","1749":"Osama bin Laden's network will not be destroyed with the death of the Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan or with the end of Mullah Muhammad Omar's reign as presumptive caliph. Qaeda cells are scattered around the globe, some in areas of the world ungoverned by any central authority: on Somali territory in Ras Kamboni, at the Kenya border; in Yemen's Hadhramaut province; and in parts of Indonesia and the southern Philippines.","1750":"'Fifty years from now the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and similar thugs will be no more than footnotes,' Secretary Powell said at the dinner he gave for the honorees, performing artists and guests. By contrast, he said, the work and the spirit of the honorees will endure. 'You are,' he told them, 'the symbol of what is good and decent and uplifting in the world.'","1751":"Muhammad Tahir is from the village of Gudara, population perhaps 4,000. Like hundreds of Afghan villages, it is not on most maps. But it lies about three miles from a now famous mountain redoubt called Tora Bora, where the United States thinks Osama bin Laden may be hiding. The elders of Gudara have gone to Jalalabad, the provincial capital, to state their case.","1752":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 2\u2014 According to Afghan commanders here in the far eastern part of the country, civilians are being killed in the American hunt for Osama bin Laden.","1753":"Osama bin Laden, according to Fox News Channel anchors, analysts and correspondents, is 'a dirtbag,' 'a monster' overseeing a 'web of hate.' His followers in Al Qaeda are 'terror goons.' Taliban fighters are 'diabolical' and 'henchmen.'","1754":"Although the Pentagon hopes that Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants will be captured or killed by opposition forces or by others motivated by a $25 million reward, or will succumb to the American bombing campaign, Mr. Rumsfeld did not rule out that extreme measures may be used to remove Taliban and Al Qaeda members from fortified caves.","1755":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 3\u2014 For weeks now, Saudi Arabia has been on the defensive, tarred in the Western press as complicit in terrorism, portrayed as the proselytizer of Islam's least tolerant version, denounced for giving rise not just to Osama bin Laden but also to 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11.","1756":"Mr. Nana added that he was not surprised to learn that his friend supported the Taliban. Mr. Walker told CNN over the weekend that he had joined the Taliban as a volunteer because his 'heart became attached to them' after he studied their movement. He also claimed to have gone to a training camp in Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden appeared several times.","1757":"His premonition proved correct on Nov. 13, when as part of an antiterrorism dragnet, the police arrested Mr. Mardini and the buyer. Mr. Mardini has since cleared himself and been freed, but a Spanish judge has accused the man who bought his business of belonging to a sleeper cell loyal to Osama bin Laden.","1758":"ROME, Dec. 3\u2014 The Italian police searched a dozen companies in Northern Italy today, looking for evidence that they might be financing Osama bin Laden's terror network, Al Qaeda.","1759":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 3\u2014 An Afghan commander said tonight that 1,500 Pashtun fighters, accompanied by American Special Operations soldiers, were prepared to attack Tora Bora, the mountain cave complex where Osama bin Laden and 2,000 Al Qaeda fighters are believed to be hiding.","1760":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 3\u2014 George J.

Early last month, the administration broadened the campaign to seize terrorists' assets beyond groups with links to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda by imposing stringent financial sanctions on Hamas, Hezbollah and 20 other groups. But few if any of those groups had assets in the United States.","1765":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 3\u2014 For weeks now, Saudi Arabia has been on the defensive, tarred in the Western press as complicit in terrorism, portrayed as the proselytizer of Islam's least tolerant version, denounced for giving rise not just to Osama bin Laden but also to 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11.","1766":"RISHKHOR, Afghanistan, Dec. 3\u2014 The crude metal noose said to have killed the mujahedeen commander Abdul Haq still hangs from a maple tree here, half a mile from one of Osama bin Laden's largest terrorist training camps.","1767":"United States marines, joined by commandos from Australia and Britain, began fitting a noose around the Taliban's stronghold of Kandahar, while American warplanes hammered the caves and tunnels of eastern Afghanistan, trying to shake loose Osama bin Laden -- in the event he is there.","1768":"If Saudi officials know how many Saudis have been fighting in Afghanistan alongside Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, they will not say.","1769":"It ended with last weekend's spasm of suicide bombings against Israeli kids -- a signal that the Palestinian national movement was being taken over by bin Ladenism, which is the nihilistic pursuit of murderous violence against civilians, without any political program and outside of any political context. If there is anything left of the Palestinian national movement for independence, it better act now to rescue itself. Otherwise it's headed for the same dark cave as Osama bin Laden.","1770":"In a Pentagon briefing today Gen. Richard B. Myers of the Air Force, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that he was aware of reports that Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top deputy to Osama bin Laden, had been wounded in an airstrike but that he could not confirm the reports. There were other unconfirmed reports of Al Qaeda figures being killed.","1771":"France is already drafting the needed Security Council resolution and Britain is prepared to organize and serve as the core of the force, which would also include willing Muslims like the Turks, diplomats said.

There was no way to verify the assertion, but reports of Mr. Zawahiri's death have circulated for days. B3","1781":"Given the opportunity to repeat this crime, the followers of Osama bin Laden would do so. Therefore, it is incumbent upon not only the administration but also upon us as citizens to see that this does not happen again. To that end, I am willing to give the Justice Department and President Bush the support that they need to eradicate this scourge. We are, after all, at war.","1782":"ATTACKING AL QAEDA -- With American military advisers working behind the scenes, a group of anti-Taliban Afghan fighters squared off for the first time against Osama bin Laden's Qaeda forces at their mountain redoubt in eastern Afghanistan.","1783":"But tonight negotiators had yet to resolve two critical issues that could affect the surrender: the fate of Mullah Muhammad Omar and of thousands of Arab fighters, who are loyal to Osama bin Laden and believed to be in Kandahar.","1784":"'In the last few days, in particular, we have emphasized, underscored and repeated our very clear position on the required disposition of Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden,' said one senior official.","1785":"'In the last few days, in particular, we have emphasized, underscored and repeated our very clear position on the required disposition of Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden,' said one senior official.","1786":"BEIJING, Dec. 6\u2014 A top American antiterrorism official wound up two days of talks here today by praising the Chinese for their cooperation in fighting Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, and said he was hopeful that the F.B.I. would soon be allowed to open a liaison office in Beijing.","1787":"The suspect, Hassan Said Awadh Khemeri, a Yemeni who had trained at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, was one of several suspects in the Cole attack who had been arrested in prior cases but released, according to interviews with officials in Yemen and the United States.","1788":"COLE ATTACK -- A Yemeni official charges that evidence linking Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to the bombing of the destroyer Cole -- including a letter believed to have been written by Mr. bin Laden and found in the house of one of the suspected plotters -- has not been turned over to the F.B.I. A1","1789":"American officials have said there is little evidence that Osama bin Laden has obtained nuclear weapons. But some experts have said terrorists might try to make a so-called radiological bomb by combining conventional explosives with radioactive material like spent nuclear fuel.","1790":"The Treasury Department has named Yasin al-Qadi, a prominent Saudi businessman, as one of those who have channeled millions of dollars to terrorist organizations. Treasury officials said Mr. Qadi had raised money from some of the kingdom's most prominent families through the Muwafaq Foundation, which Treasury officials have described as a front for Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda.","1792":"That same month, Osama bin Laden came back to Afghanistan, where he had supported the resistance to the Soviet invasion. He had been expelled from the Sudan, stripped of his citizenship by Saudi Arabia. Afghanistan was probably the only country in the world where he could find refuge and allegiance.","1793":"Another issue that has arisen with the surrender of Kandahar is the fate of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban. Though Mr. Haass was unequivocal about the intention of bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, he left open the possibility that the interim administration, led by a southern Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, would be allowed to try Mullah Omar.","1794":"Mr. Bush mentioned neither Mr. Omar nor Osama bin Laden by name, but left no doubt that his language of war was directed at them. The terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks, he said, 'celebrate death, making a mission of murder and a sacrament of suicide.' And yet, he added, 'for some reason, only young followers are ushered down this deadly path to paradise, while terrorist leaders run into caves to save their own hides.'","1796":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 7\u2014 Anti-Taliban Afghan fighters appeared stalled today in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by Osama bin Laden loyalists and then begin a full-scale search for him there.","1797":"PARIS, Dec. 7\u2014 Investigators piecing together the suicide-bomb assassination of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Afghan rebel leader, say they believe the plot was carried out by members of a European-based cell of Al Qaeda that on remote-control command from Osama bin Laden reached back to Afghanistan to destroy its prey.","1798":"CAVE WARFARE -- Anti-Taliban Afghan fighters appeared stalled in their drive to capture a complex of mountain caves held by Osama bin Laden loyalists and to begin a full-scale search for him there. B2","1799":"In the east, attacks by opposition forces stalled in the mountains around Tora Bora, where 2,000 Al Qaeda fighters and the other fugitive, Osama bin Laden, were believed to be holed up. Spurred perhaps by the $25 million reward on Mr. bin Laden's head, there were reports that he had been seen on a horse and that his headquarters had been found, but neither seemed to be true.","1800":"Another issue that has arisen with the surrender of Kandahar is the fate of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban. Though Mr. Haass was unequivocal about the intention of bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, he left open the possibility that the interim administration, led by a southern Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, would be allowed to try Mullah Omar.","1801":"CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 7\u2014 It was not supposed to be about an American military campaign in Afghanistan and the fate of Osama bin Laden. It was not supposed to be about Israeli airstrikes in the West Bank and a new standoff between Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat.","1802":"General Gul remains a supporter of the Taliban and he denounced the Americans for condemning them and Osama bin Laden without providing any proof of guilt.","1803":"Imposing challenges lie ahead, like finding Osama bin Laden and top Taliban leaders like Mullah Muhammmad Omar, securing the power of the new coalition government and feeding millions of refugees displaced by years of conflict. Americans must understand that despite the Taliban's rapid collapse, Washington's military and humanitarian responsibilities in Afghanistan are far from over.","1804":"The Soviet occupation began attracting mujahedeen fighters from the Islamic world, including Osama bin Laden. In 1984, they began receiving broad assistance, in weapons and training, from the United States.","1805":"Since then, President Bush has challenged Chechen rebels to sever all ties with Osama bin Laden and terrorism. The United States now not only agrees that the war in Chechnya has a terrorist element, but has moved on its own to choke off funds that fuel the conflict, a senior American diplomat said recently.","1806":"'There is a villain in the story who betrays Charlemagne and causes the death of innocent women and children,' Mr. Cuticchio said recently in Italian in his workshop here. 'And everyone who sees the puppet plays will understand that this villain named Gano di Magonza is the puppet incarnation of Osama bin Laden.'","1807":"SHIFT IN FOCUS -- The focus of the war shifted from fallen Kandahar to the eastern mountains around Tora Bora, where Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda fighters were believed to be dug in. A day after Taliban forces abandoned their last stronghold at Kandahar, pockets of resistance led to isolated skirmishes near the city. While fighting among victorious factions inside Kandahar quieted down, rivals claimed control of key parts of the city and tensions were running high.","1808":"The whereabouts of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, and his patron, Osama bin Laden, were still a mystery. Despite unconfirmed reports that Mullah Omar had been seized by a warlord in Kandahar, the Northern Alliance foreign minister, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, said Mullah Omar was still missing.","1809":"11 7 3 HOLY WAR, INC., by Peter L. Bergen. (Free Press, $26.) A television journalist's account of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.","1812":"Yet blaming ourselves for na\u00efvet\u00e9 misses an essential point. Part of what makes a civilization civilized is a natural reluctance to believe unconscionable evil until it is realized in front of us. This is not a failing. It is an achievement. Part of the essence of civilization is the slow accretion of social and civic trust that enables us to live together in highly complex and interdependent ways. That achievement was severely dented on Sept. 11, and our civilization is less civilized as a result. But it is also more mobilized, more conscious and therefore more alive. If our response to Sept. 11 shows anything -- the heroism of the rescue workers, the patriotism of millions, the prosecution of a tenacious and unrelenting war on terrorism -- it is that civilization, though wounded, is far from over. In fact, the one incontrovertible fact of post-Sept. 11 America is that civilization can clearly, ruthlessly defend itself. Call that the reverse idea of the World Trade Center massacre: the idea that, when mortally threatened, freedom can fight back. And that's an idea that will last much longer than the dark 'brilliance' of Osama bin Laden.","1813":"Must a state extradite war-crimes suspects who seek refuge on their own soil? Yes, says the Princeton group -- unless the prosecuting state employs the death penalty, torture or cruel and degrading punishment. Osama bin Laden, if indicted for crimes against humanity, could be prosecuted anywhere in the world -- but if the prosecuting state employed the death penalty, no country would be obligated to extradite him there. American courts automatically have jurisdiction over terrorists acts committed on United States soil. But if a third country proposed, as the Bush administration has, to try bin Laden before a military tribunal, states could refuse to extradite him there too.","1814":"European nations have been pressing for such a force. The American position is that we must first finish the war against Osama bin Laden, but now that this military objective is close to being achieved, the Bush administration still shows little sense of urgency about protecting Afghan civilians. It does not want more than a limited international peacekeeping force for Afghanistan and appears hesitant to become directly involved in any broader nation building. Administration officials talk about handing over security to an all-Afghan force, but such a force cannot be assembled in time to ensure the delivery of aid before the current winter season takes what could be an enormous toll.","1815":"Although poverty, injustice and servitude may similarly compel the disenfranchised to an interest in Osama bin Laden or Che Guevara, the comparison of bin Laden to Guevara more usefully shows the difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist. Guevara never targeted civilians, and he did not divide the world between good and evil, infidels and the chosen. Osama is feared. Che was, and still is, loved by millions.","1816":"CAIRO\u2014 CONFLICTING reports last week suggested that Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants, might have died or lost his wife and several children when American bombs struck Taliban bases in the Afghan mountains. Whatever his fate, Dr. Zawahiri, a 50-year-old Egyptian surgeon, is viewed as the man who convinced Mr. bin Laden to undertake a kind of death match against Western civilization by transforming his worldwide movement of Islamic militants into an instrument of mass murder.","1817":"They include more than the hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden, his Al Qaeda collaborators and the thousands of Arab and other foreign fighters he drew to Afghanistan.","1818":"But the Bantu say they are not true Somalis and should not be penalized for the actions of Somalis who may be sympathizers of Osama bin Laden.","1819":"Even anti-American fervor has waned. While some Pakistani youths demonstrated in support of Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, upper middle class Iranian youths held a candlelight vigil to condemn the attacks and mourn the dead.","1821":"The Afghan authority decided upon in Bonn is hardly perfect, as even the United Nations negotiators acknowledged, and it may fracture or be unable to assert its authority outside Kabul. But the conference produced a success, the first peacefully negotiated, internationally supported government for Afghanistan in more than 20 years -- made possible by the American-led war against Osama bin Laden and his own hosts, the Taliban.","1822":"AFGHANISTAN -- By week's end, some of the United States' military campaign's goals were either met or tantalizingly close. After a chaotic push, opposition forces strongly backed by American and allied troops took Kandahar, the Taliban's last stronghold, and were -- at least according to some reports -- close to control of Tora Bora, the northeastern mountain cave complex believed to be the last Afghan redoubt of Osama bin Laden. In Bonn, Afghan factions agreed on a provisional post-Taliban government led by Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun leader, that would be installed Dec. 22 and operate for at least six months.","1823":"Scattered among those ridges are 30 or 40 fortified caves that are the last bastion of Osama bin Laden's hard-core supporters -- and perhaps the hide-out of the terrorist mastermind himself -- the final focus of America's war in Afghanistan.","1824":"American B-52's intensified their bombardment of a complex of caves in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden was believed to be hiding, and American marines in the south and the army of neighboring Pakistan tightened the dragnet on the ground. Nonetheless, there was no sign of either the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, or of Mr. bin Laden himself.","1825":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 9\u2014 A tape of Osama bin Laden found recently in Afghanistan shows him recounting how he listened to news reports on the radio of the first plane crashing into the World Trade Center three months ago and quickly told others around him 'there will be more' as he awaited the second attack.","1826":"DURRAT AL-AROOS, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 8\u2014 Saudi Arabia's top security official said this weekend that he believed that militants other than Osama bin Laden stood at the helm of Al Qaeda, and he warned that the arrest or killing of Mr. bin Laden would not cripple the terrorist organization.","1827":"In Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden is narrowing. But on the war's financial front, the government is only now beginning to come to grips with Al Qaeda's money-raising apparatus, which officials say is so far-flung and diversified that it could survive even if Mr. bin Laden is captured or killed.","1828":"As American bombers continue to pound the area in eastern Afghanistan where Osama bin Laden is believed to be holding out, new and chilling evidence has surfaced that United States officials say confirms his links to the attacks against the United States on Sept. 11.","1829":"Mr. Russert questioned Mrs. Clinton on a range of topics, including military tribunals, bioterrorism, and the current strife in Israel. They were not all softballs: he pressed her on accusations that the Clinton administration had failed to take terrorism, and specifically Osama bin Laden, seriously enough.","1830":"But Osama bin Laden is still at large, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has called the remaining task of flushing out stray Taliban from Afghanistan a 'particularly dirty and unpleasant one.' Almost as unsavory, at least to the men and women at the White House charged with negotiating with Capitol Hill, were the war cries from Democrats angry that Mr. Bush continues to back an economic stimulus bill that they say favors big corporations and the rich. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, who is to meet with the president over breakfast tomorrow, warned that Mr. Bush has to get involved in forging a compromise -- or else.","1831":"LONDON, Dec. 9\u2014 The country's chief law enforcement officer said today that Britain's alliance with the United States made it the likeliest European target for international terrorists like Osama bin Laden and that 'na\u00efve' parliamentary resistance to the government's antiterrorism legislation was increasing the risk.","1832":"Scattered among those ridges are 30 or 40 fortified caves that are the last bastion of Osama bin Laden's hard-core supporters -- and perhaps the hide-out of the terrorist mastermind himself -- the final focus of America's war in Afghanistan.","1833":"Because his city is a principal port of call for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas, Boston's mayor, Thomas M. Menino, assumed he would be alerted to threats made on gas supplies in this country. But when Attorney General John Ashcroft announced recently that Osama bin Laden might have approved a plan for his followers to attack gas supplies, it was news to Mr. Menino.","1834":"Only two or three Taliban leaders have been captured by opposition forces in recent days, including the Taliban army chief of staff, officials said today. And while some in the Osama bin Laden's hierarchy have been killed by bombs or missiles, not one has been captured in Afghanistan, and many are thought to remain in hiding. That includes Mr. bin Laden, whom the United States accuses of masterminding the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","1835":"For several days the main issue has been whether the Afghans would accept such a large force. Now, the debate has shifted to what relationship the new force should have to American military commanders still chasing Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda terrorists and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.","1836":"Having discouraged American television news organizations from broadcasting videotapes made by Osama bin Laden, the White House now finds itself in the awkward position of weighing what to do with a new recording that it obviously wants the world to see. It should make the tape public, as it seems inclined to do. The White House never should have gotten into the news management business in the first place.","1837":"In eastern Afghanistan, the hunt for Osama bin Laden was still on, even as American planes continue to bomb the caves and tunnels of the Tora Bora mountains.","1838":"ROUND ONE -- Nine weeks after American bombs began falling on Afghanistan, a senior Pentagon official said the Taliban government had been defeated. But, with no member of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda hierarchy having been captured in Afghanistan, the official warned that the military campaign was far from over. A1","1839":"'Day by day we are explaining to them that no one will hurt them and that we will treat the injured,' said General Jurabek, a Soviet-trained officer. 'I explained to them that Osama bin Laden is a vile hard-line terrorist and Mullah Muhammad Omar too, because they wanted to destroy all of Afghanistan,' he said. 'And the prisoners are changing their minds now.'","1840":"Tunisian authorities have since seized and convicted Mr. Saidani, 35, who was deported from Italy earlier this year. He may not have been a significant player in Al Qaeda, but Tunisian authorities considered him an important link in a loose network of North African immigrants in Europe inspired by Osama bin Laden.","1841":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 10\u2014 President Bush said today that a videotape showing Osama bin Laden reveling in the Sept. 11 attacks proved that the Al Qaeda leader was 'guilty of incredible murder' and that he 'has no conscience and no soul.'","1842":"An uncertain number of Chinese Muslims, members of the Uighur ethnic minority, have trained in Osama bin Laden's camps and fought with the Taliban.","1843":"Mr. Blair said time was short, yet he was unable to say whether a British-led force could deploy in Afghanistan by Dec. 22, the date the interim Afghan government led by Hamid Karzai will set itself up in Kabul and take political control of the country. The multinational force will operate independently from United States forces, which will continue their military campaign to crush the remnants of the Taliban and hunt for Osama bin Laden.","1844":"Gerry Spence, the defense lawyer known for his Stetson and Western swagger, imagines that at a civilian trial, a lawyer for Osama bin Laden would try to force American secret agents to blow their cover in order to explain how they came up with damning videotapes of the master terrorist.","1845":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 11\u2014 Thousands of Pakistani soldiers have been deployed on mountain peaks and in hidden valleys along the Afghan border in recent days in a bid to cut off escape routes for Osama bin Laden and his fighters from the remote enclave of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan, Pakistan military officials said today.","1846":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Dec. 12\u2014 American bombers laid a heavy barrage across the snowcapped mountains here early this morning as efforts to arrange a surrender of embattled Osama bin Laden fighters broke down.","1847":"Then in 1996, Mr. Badreya said, a man he had never seen before was outside the mosque one day passing out cassette tapes of a lecture by Osama bin Laden.","1848":"The pressures on Al Qaeda escalated yesterday on two continents. In the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden and his followers are believed to be hiding, Afghan tribal forces, supported by American bombs and commandos, were advancing on the group's cave complexes. Some tribal commanders said the group had agreed to lay down arms today, but the deal unraveled early this morning and American B-52's resumed bombing.","1849":"The inquiry received new information from a videotape of Osama bin Laden that was found recently in Afghanistan. The tape has not been released publicly yet, but according to administration officials who have read a transcript, Mr. bin Laden is recorded as saying he had specific expectations of the damage that the attacks would produce, including at least a partial collapse of the World Trade Center towers.","1850":"Your description of Osama bin Laden's amusement at hijackers who 'did not know they had volunteered for a suicide mission' (editorial, Dec. 11) certainly raises some significant questions.","1851":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 11\u2014 Al Jazeera, the Persian Gulf television network, obtained an exclusive interview with Osama bin Laden in October, the only television interview the terrorist leader has given since the war in Afghanistan began. But the network never broadcast the interview, partly because it revealed how much Mr. bin Laden had intimidated the network's correspondent, according to American and Middle Eastern government officials.","1852":"BREAKDOWN AT TORA BORA -- American bombers laid a heavy barrage across the snowcapped mountains of Tora Bora as efforts to arrange a surrender of embattled Osama bin Laden fighters broke down. A1","1853":"The indictment accused the man, Zacarias Moussaoui, a 33-year-old French citizen of Moroccan descent, of 'conspiring with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to murder thousands of innocent people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania on Sept. 11.' [Excerpts, Page B6.]","1854":"Most people said they were now confident that Osama bin Laden would be captured or killed by the United States. Men were even more confident than women that United States forces would capture or kill the Al Qaeda leader.","1856":"Osama bin Laden was not named as a defendant in today's 31-page indictment. This preserves the option of bringing Mr. bin Laden before a military commission if he is taken alive by American forces, officials said. Mr. bin Laden is already under indictment in New York, charged in the conspiracy to bomb two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998.","1857":"The administration considered having a military commission handle the Moussaoui case. Under the president's lamentable order authorizing the tribunals, any foreigner implicated in terrorist acts could be subject to their jurisdiction. Mr. Moussaoui should not be considered the exception because he was arrested on American soil, or because there appears to be a great deal of circumstantial evidence against him. Anyone charged with being involved in the attacks, including Osama bin Laden, should stand trial in an ordinary American court, regardless of where that person is arrested or how challenging his prosecution might seem.","1858":"Is Osama bin Laden still in Afghanistan? Is a wholesale surrender by Al Qaeda in the offing? Have large numbers of Mr. bin Laden's recruits slipped over the border into Pakistan? The answers to these and other crucial questions are as elusive as who holds sway over large pockets of a struggling and threadbare Afghanistan.","1859":"These intelligence officials also said that they believed that Osama bin Laden and many of the surviving leaders of Al Qaeda were holed up in the mountains in the Tora Bora area of eastern Afghanistan, dismissing reports that Mr. bin Laden had tried to flee into Pakistan in recent days.","1860":"In a broad sense, the government appears to have calculated that Mr. Moussaoui's trial is its best, and possibly only, chance to lay before the world the case that Osama bin Laden and his network were responsible for the attacks.","1861":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 12\u2014 American intelligence agencies have warned that Osama bin Laden and his aides may try to escape by sea aboard one of several cargo ships that Al Qaeda and its supporters have acquired in recent years, Bush administration officials say.","1862":"The commanders of the Afghan tribal forces -- spurred by American pressure and the possibility of a $25 million reward -- are now demanding that Al Qaeda forces turn over their leader, Osama bin Laden, although his presence in these eastern Afghan mountains could not be confirmed.","1863":"Until now, the State Department has resisted lobbying from American Jewish organizations and lawmakers to advertise rewards for Palestinian-related terrorism. Instead, it has confined its public appeals for information to terrorist suspects like Osama bin Laden (up to a $25 million reward) and organizations like Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement.","1864":"DEADLINE FOR SURRENDER -- Afghan fighters set a new deadline of Thursday for Al Qaeda loyalists bottled up in canyons and caves to give up, after an agreement for a surrender yesterday morning collapsed in confusion. The commanders of the tribal forces -- spurred by American pressure and the possibility of a $25 million reward -- are now demanding that Al Qaeda forces turn over their leader, Osama bin Laden. A1","1865":"In recent weeks, as criticism of Saudi Arabia has swirled in the Western press, some Saudi officials have taken steps to defend the kingdom's reputation, particularly against allegations of noncooperation in the war on terrorism. In interviews, a series of senior Saudi officials have agreed to speak publicly about the Sept. 11 attacks, which American officials have said were led by the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and his organization, Al Qaeda, and about their government's attempts to combat terrorism.","1866":"But maybe the misty skies were the right thing. After all, if anyone thought the work of Osama bin Laden and his trained terrorists on Sept. 11 was not something personal, that was laid to rest by the images and words released on videotape by the Bush administration yesterday.","1867":"No group took responsibility, and government officials refused to speculate publicly on who might have done it. But suspicion fell on Al Qaeda, the terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden, and Islamic militant groups based in Pakistan that have sought to end Indian control over part of Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim border area that India considers a state in its union.","1868":"But when Osama bin Laden interrupted her peach Danish this morning, Ms. Brown said she longed to smash through her TV screen and strangle him.","1869":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13\u2014 The tape that was released today by the White House offers an unparalleled glimpse into the world of Osama bin Laden and like-minded Islamic extremists.","1870":"THE VIDEOTAPE -- An amateur videotape released by the United States showed Osama bin Laden laughing and boasting about the Sept. 11 attacks, saying that the planes that flew into the trade center towers did more damage than he had imagined they would. Administration officials called the tape highly incriminating proof that Mr. bin Laden was guilty in the attacks. A1","1871":"MILAN, Dec. 13\u2014 For two years, Stefano Dambruoso, a young prosecutor, and his team in Milan have been after a group they are calling Europe's main logistical support center for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terror network.","1872":"Following are excerpts from the transcript of the videotape released yesterday by the Pentagon showing Osama bin Laden discussing the Sept. 11 attacks during a visit to a Sheik al-Ghamdi, possibly in mid-November in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The full text and two video excerpts are available at The New York Times on the Web at nytimes.com/world.","1873":"A man charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to kill thousands of people in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Zacarias Moussaoui, yesterday was ordered transferred from New York to Virginia for a trial that could bring the death penalty.","1874":"All three major television networks as well as the three all-news cable channels gave blanket coverage to the release of the Osama bin Laden tape yesterday, the first time in two months that all of them agreed that a development in the terrorism story merited such across-the-board, live coverage.","1875":"The United States has counted on support from Mr. Karimov in the war against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, using a base in Uzbekistan and reaching an agreement on cooperation in defense matters.","1876":"But the equation changed this week when Pakistan decided to try to cut off any escape routes for Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda who are presumed to be holed up at Tora Bora just over the border.","1877":"'Defending the American people is my highest priority as commander in chief and I cannot and will not allow the United States to remain in a treaty that prevents us from developing effective defenses,' Mr. Bush said. Then he turned and walked briskly back to the Oval Office, saying nothing about the tape of Osama bin Laden that his administration was preparing to release, or the mounting violence between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.","1878":"The images may be grainy and the audio a bit garbled, but the essence of the man comes through with chilling clarity. The videotape released yesterday by the Department of Defense captures the evil of Osama bin Laden in a candid, unguarded moment. This was not a piece of propaganda produced for wide distribution, but rather the recording of an intimate, informal gathering in early November between a relaxed bin Laden and a few gleeful followers who seem almost giddy that the Sept. 11 attacks were far deadlier than expected.","1880":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13\u2014 The United States released a videotape today showing Osama bin Laden laughing and boasting about the Sept. 11 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people.","1881":"The images were shadowy and the voices at times muffled, but in the videotape made public by the United States government, Osama bin Laden and his guests, gathered together for dinner somewhere in Afghanistan in November, were certainly gleeful as they told and retold the terrible events of Sept. 11.","1882":"CAIRO, Dec. 13\u2014 The videotape of Osama bin Laden that was released today is unlikely to change the minds of those Arabs who already suspect the worst of the United States.","1883":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 13\u2014 American-backed forces believe that they have surrounded Osama bin Laden and the last of his hard-core fighters in a complex of caves between two valleys just south of here, a senior American military official said tonight.","1884":"CAIRO, Dec. 14\u2014 The Muslim clerics mentioned on the latest Osama bin Laden videotape, along with his Saudi dinner guest, are seemingly low-level religious figures known more for their anti-Western fervor than for having any widespread following in the kingdom or elsewhere, Saudi sources and Western diplomats said today.","1885":"CAIRO, Dec. 14\u2014 The Muslim clerics mentioned on the latest Osama bin Laden videotape, along with his Saudi dinner guest, are seemingly low-level religious figures known more for their anti-Western fervor than for having any widespread following in the kingdom or elsewhere, Saudi sources and Western diplomats said today.","1886":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14\u2014 The Osama bin Laden videotape is raising new questions among intelligence officials about why American authorities failed to uncover the plot of the Sept. 11 attacks before they occurred.","1887":"'Portrait of a Terrorist' (editorial, Dec. 14) notes that before the videotape of Osama bin Laden 'can be admitted in any legal proceeding,' 'other details will have to be provided.' You overlooked that it would be admissible in a trial before a military tribunal.","1888":"The attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 set off a flurry of rumors and conspiracy theories among Muslims unwilling to lay the blame on Osama bin Laden -- or any Muslim. It was Israel, they declared. Or American white supremacists. Or fanatical Christians.","1889":"We were all appalled and nauseated by the heinousness and glee of Osama bin Laden in proudly proclaiming his responsibility for the slaughter of thousands of innocents. It should, however, come as no surprise. Leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been proudly doing the same after the intentional slaughter of innocent civilians in Israel.","1890":"New York has the most copious record prosecuting terrorists of any jurisdiction in the land. Over the past eight years the U.S. attorney, Mary Jo White, has successfully prosecuted 26 jihad conspirators, in six major trials and some minor ones. They include a charismatic, hate-preaching Egyptian sheik with a large cult following and several associates of Osama bin Laden. The parade of justice has continued, under heightened security but unabated, since the Sept. 11 attacks. Five weeks after the twin towers fell, four bin Laden associates were trooped into a courtroom and sentenced to life without parole for the U.S. embassy bombings. Another fairly senior Al Qaeda suspect in the East Africa bombings is about to come to trial.","1891":"Just two weeks ago, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld dismissed the idea of detaining large numbers of Taliban or Al Qaeda prisoners, beyond top leaders like Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden. But this week, he announced that American forces in Afghanistan would very likely take a sizable number of prisoners into custody.","1892":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Saturday, Dec. 15\u2014 American and British commandos, operating behind a screen of local Afghan fighters, had the last remnants of Osama bin Laden's followers -- and perhaps the terrorist mastermind himself -- cornered here this morning in a narrow stretch of a ridge line, canyons and caves high in the White Mountains.","1893":"As an American Muslim, I have no doubt that Osama bin Laden sponsored the horrific attacks of Sept. 11. In the final analysis, however, the release of the purported 'smoking gun' videotape (front page, Dec. 14) will probably not have a significant impact on world opinion.","1894":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14\u2014 In reaching their assessment that Osama bin Laden is probably still in the mountains of Afghanistan near Tora Bora, American commanders are relying on high-tech surveillance equipment, but also on surmise and on reports from local Afghan fighters who are helping in the fight against his forces there.","1895":"Two months ago, the war in Afghanistan seemed dauntingly open-ended. Taliban and Al Qaeda forces controlled 90 percent of the land. The local opposition was in disarray. Mullah Muhammad Omar reigned in Kabul and blustered in Kandahar. Finding Osama bin Laden seemed hopeless.","1896":"The videotape of Osama bin Laden boasting about and gloating over the Sept. 11 attacks (front page, Dec. 14) shows him to be nothing less than the ruthless, calculating, odious individual we all knew he was.","1897":"While it may seem like the ultimate smoking gun, defense lawyers said there would be ways to try to undercut the videotape of Osama bin Laden if he were to go on trial for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.","1898":"Washington has declared zero tolerance of terrorism, but has also relied heavily on Pakistan in its war against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. The question is whether to continue urging restraint by India, or to allow India -- as the United States has with Israel -- to retaliate for suicide bombings.","1899":"Mr. Blair, who enjoyed a warm friendship with Bill Clinton, has surprised many by forging a close relationship with George W. Bush. More than that, he has been America's indispensable ally. In October, when Washington was reluctant to publish its initial evidence that Osama bin Laden was behind the Sept. 11 attacks for fear of compromising intelligence sources, Mr. Blair drew up a white paper accusing Al Qaeda, relying on information gathered by British intelligence services.","1900":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 14\u2014 The Bush administration moved today to make the newest Osama bin Laden tape the centerpiece of an effort to convince the Arab world, and the larger Muslim one, that the Saudi terrorist does not deserve their allegiance.","1901":"At first, the thought was to give Americans poetic tools like 'Osama bin Laden,' 'evil' and even 'hate.' But cooler -- or more risk-averse -- heads prevailed. 'Basically we took all the words from the songs 'America the Beautiful,' 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and 'God Bless America,'' Kapell says. 'That alone gives you around 300.' Then he watched a lot of news coverage on TV, 'taking down all the words out of people's mouths.' The total of a thousand words were reduced by four-fifths, then added to the company's standard 200 'bits and pieces': connectors like 'I,' 'we' and 'the' and modifiers like '-ed,' '-ing' and '-ly.' An agnostic, Kapell agonized over 'God,' but O.K.'d it -- he knew it would be missed. Same for 'president,' in whom Kapell says he has similarly imperfect faith.","1903":"IT looks so ordinary. Men are sitting in a small white room on the floor near some gray, flowered throw pillows. They are laughing, drinking, eating with their hands, adjusting their turbans. A visitor identified in the transcript as a sheik sits next to Osama bin Laden. He exclaims what a nice pad Mr. bin Laden has, how clean and comfortable the guest quarters are.","1904":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 15\u2014 The United States has intercepted radio communications in recent days that officials said appeared to record Osama bin Laden giving orders to Al Qaeda troops in the mountainous region around Tora Bora, where Afghan and American soldiers are engaged in fierce combat with the enemy.","1905":"A. Maybe it's a twin conclusion. One is that certainty is the enemy of decency and humanity in people who are sure they are right, like Osama bin Laden and John Ashcroft. And secondly that for this country at least, given the kind of obstreperous, populous, diverse country we are, law is the absolute essential. And when governments short-cut the law, it's extremely dangerous.","1906":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 15\u2014 Even as American forces and their Afghan allies close in on Al Qaeda fighters in the mountains here, the forbidding terrain and the stubbornness of some of the foreign followers of Osama bin Laden are making the struggle for Tora Bora the most complex battle of the war.","1907":"And that brings me to the Osama bin Laden tape just released. What was most chilling about that tape was not bin Laden's boasting about his mass murder. What was most chilling was the unidentified Saudi sheik sitting next to him, who so eagerly nodded his head in agreement with everything bin Laden said, and who assured him that in the mosques in Saudi Arabia the reaction to the terror acts had been 'very positive.'","1909":"In its efforts to obtain the continued cooperation of Pakistan in the fight against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the Bush administration had refrained from pushing too hard for it to clamp down on the two organizations, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, which operate openly in Pakistan and advocate violence to drive India out of Kashmir.","1910":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 15\u2014 The siege of Osama bin Laden's band of followers, trapped high in the White Mountains, ebbed from fighting to surrender negotiations again today -- but the heavy American bombing of the ridges and peaks continued unabated.","1911":"For three months, Mr. Putin has cheered America from the sidelines, offering political support at the United Nations and opening for Washington a library of Russian intelligence dossiers on Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda's terror network, which has plagued Russia and Central Asia for years.","1912":"On Dec. 1, American planes attacked several villages near the mountainous redoubt of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda fighters -- and perhaps even Osama bin Laden -- were presumed to be hiding. It was an inauspicious beginning to a furious air campaign.","1913":"OSAMA BIN LADEN -- In a week that marked the three-month anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, United States forces and their allies in Afghanistan penetrated an increasingly fierce circle of Taliban fighters in the mountainous area of Tora Bora and concluded that the cave sheltering Osama bin Laden, the leader of the Qaeda terror network, might be at hand. Suddenly, it seemed possible that he would soon be apprehended -- alive or dead.","1914":"The war in Afghanistan moved inexorably toward a climax. American warplanes bombed the ridge positions and cave and tunnel hideouts of Al Qaeda's remnant forces in the eastern mountains around Tora Bora, and on the ground the Afghan militia was closing in on what may be Osama bin Laden's last redoubt.","1915":"TAKING PRISONERS -- Local Afghan leaders warned that the harsh terrain of Tora Bora and the tenacity of some of the foreign followers of Osama bin Laden might prolong the campaign. A1","1916":"General Cimatu contended that the rebels were linked to Al Qaeda, the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden. But the evidence he offered was circumstantial.","1917":"CAIRO, Dec. 15\u2014 The United States faces an uphill battle in using the latest videotape of Osama bin Laden to influence public opinion in the Arab world, where Washington's support for Israel over the Palestinians dominates news coverage and the public tends to regard the fight to dismantle Al Qaeda as something of an American problem.","1918":"The monumental task of rebuilding Afghanistan after the war has been made far more difficult, experts say, by a problem that would have existed even without the Taliban and Osama bin Laden: the drought that has gripped the country and much of southwestern Asia for three years.","1919":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 15\u2014 The Saudi who was seen visiting Osama bin Laden in the videotape released this week is a 38-year-old veteran of conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya who left the kingdom most recently on Sept. 21, a senior Saudi official said today.","1920":"But these forms of egotism are piddling compared with the grandiosity of religiosity displayed by Osama bin Laden on the tape released by the White House last week, cloaking conceit in asceticism and mass murder in spirituality.","1921":"Fantasies of evil and dreams of victory over its agents are increasing in voltage, needless to say, in response to the terrible events of recent times. Osama bin Laden, in fact, appears eerily to be continuing Sauron and Voldemort's legacy (as well as, perhaps, the earlier ambitions of the lethal, foreign antagonists of James Bond).","1922":"STILL AT LARGE -- For one thing, Osama bin Laden has yet to be located, let alone captured or killed. For the United States, that is a critical bit of unfinished business since Mr. bin Laden has been identified as the mastermind of the deadly attacks that sent America to war. But it is not necessarily so for the local Afghan commanders, who want most of all to cleanse their land of Mr. bin Laden and his foreign fighters. For them, capturing the man himself has been a challenge, but not the main goal. 'If he's here, it is our responsibility to catch him,' said Commander Zaman Ali. 'But he's not here.'","1923":"Mr. Bush's central goal, capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants, remains largely unfulfilled. Military officials say they have no idea how many Al Qaeda leaders have been killed in the last week, but they know that none of the two dozen or so top leaders of the group who have been identified as targets by the United States have been taken prisoner.","1924":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 16\u2014 Two retired Pakistani nuclear scientists suspected of passing nuclear secrets to Osama bin Laden have been released and declared innocent, the son of one of them said today.","1925":"As I watched the tape of Osama bin Laden boasting that the World Trade Center carnage went beyond even his own twisted imaginings, I thought of my conversations with Brendan Gallagher, a trader who transferred just a month before the attack from Cantor Fitzgerald, near the top of Tower 1, to Euro Brokers on the 84th floor of Tower 2.","1926":"But since Sept. 11, the president has kept his personal belief in Christianity unusually private -- he would not say this week whether he still reads the Bible every day -- as he has made extraordinary gestures to Islam. The politics here are as obvious as they are praised, particularly by Muslims pleased that the White House has continually said that its war is against Osama bin Laden and not the prophet Muhammad.","1927":"Instead, Mr. Rumsfeld told Hamid Karzai, the provisional head of government, and Gen. Muhammad Fahim, the incoming defense minister, that much work remained in hunting down the Taliban and members of Osama bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda.","1928":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 16\u2014 American officials said today that Al Qaeda had been effectively destroyed in Afghanistan, and Afghan commanders here declared victory in the fierce battle for the mountain stronghold of Osama bin Laden's organization. But neither Americans nor Afghans said they knew where Mr. bin Laden was.","1929":"A BATTLE ENDS -- American officials said Al Qaeda had been effectively destroyed in Afghanistan, and Afghan commanders declared victory in the fierce battle for Tora Bora,the mountain stronghold of Osama bin Laden's organization. But neither Americans nor Afghans said they knew where Mr. bin Laden was. A1","1930":"Earlier this year, Hamid Karzai, convinced that Osama bin Laden had become the puppet master of Afghanistan, decided to return from exile to help lead the resistance, Qayum Karzai said. He said Hamid Karzai had expected long years of dangerous political insurgency while other nations continued to ignore Afghanistan's collapse. Then came Sept. 11.","1931":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 17\u2014 Hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters have fled from the caves of Tora Bora into the snow-capped mountains that mark the Pakistan border, and Osama bin Laden may be among them, according to United States intelligence officials, who acknowledged today that they had lost track of him.","1932":"'I was going to the New Jersey Sports Authority, but Osama bin Laden had other plans,' he said.","1933":"TRACKING BIN LADEN -- Hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters have fled the caves of Tora Bora into the snow-capped mountains on the border with Pakistan, and Osama bin Laden may be among them, according to United States intelligence officials, who acknowledged that they had lost track of him. The officials thought they had a bead on Mr. bin Laden's location until sometime Saturday, when radio traffic and other communications they had been intercepting between Al Qaeda leaders dried up. A1","1934":"The war aims of the United States and the anti-Taliban opposition do not always neatly coincide. Here at Tora Bora, Afghan forces were concerned principally with recovering territory while the United States was intent on the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden, who has eluded his pursuers.","1935":"American military officials have also indicated a preference for a smaller force, arguing that a large contingent of peacekeepers could complicate the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","1936":"On April 30, 1945, as Soviet troops closed in on central Berlin, Adolf Hitler bid farewell to the aides gathered in his bunker beneath the Reich Chancellery and killed himself with a bullet to the head. Many Americans grew up with a vision of war as something that ends with that kind of finality. Since then we have become acquainted with more inconclusive finales. As America searches for Osama bin Laden in the mountainous wilderness of eastern Afghanistan, we are learning that even in victory, finding the end point can be frustratingly elusive.","1937":"Last week, the courtly 59-year-old lawyer learned that his instincts had been right. He was assigned to defend the only person indicted so far in the events of Sept. 11, Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan ancestry who is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the attacks.","1938":"Jaish-e-Muhammad (meaning Army of Muhammad) is essentially a spinoff of another militant Pakistani organization, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, and is suspected of receiving support from Osama bin Laden.","1939":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 17\u2014 NATO troops have raided the offices of an American charity in Kosovo as part of an investigation that, according to the Bush administration, links at least two large Muslim charities based in Illinois to fund-raising for Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network.","1940":"Editorials: The hunt for Osama bin Laden; dimming prospects for farm reform; Andr\u00e9s Martinez on the train to Newark Airport.","1941":"LONDON, Dec. 17\u2014 A London-based Saudi businessman and two Egyptians lost a three-year battle today to avoid extradition to New York to stand trial on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in bombing the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","1942":"Yet the family has to eat, and the only way to get food is to work the land -- even if every step is dangerous. This makes the problem of land mines central to any discussion of Afghanistan's future, for the mines are a critical impediment to the country's recovery. Long after Osama bin Laden is buried, after a new government is presiding over Afghanistan's reconstruction, land mines will continue to haunt this country.","1943":"It is the supporters of terrorism in the mountains of Tora Bora who are looking terrified these days. Exhausted and whimpering, vanquished fighters for Osama bin Laden were paraded for the cameras yesterday by their new Afghan jailers as visual aids for the continuing story of Al Qaeda on the run.","1944":"The absence of any confirmed evidence tying Iraq to either the Sept. 11 or anthrax attacks increases the difficulty of convincing Arabs that it is necessary to strike now. An American attack could well enhance the perception that the United States was making Muslims its target and thus unravel the reluctant Arab support for dismantling Osama bin Laden's network of terror.","1945":"He may also shed new light on the underground financial connections between Al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia, which American officials say supplied Osama bin Laden with much of the funding for his organization.","1946":"Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in the Hadhramaut region of Yemen, is believed to have followers in dozens of countries.","1947":"The fighters have killed many of the enemy, too. About 200 Al Qaeda fighters died in the last two weeks of combat in Tora Bora. But the fate of a larger number of the terror group's soldiers -- the estimates range from 500 to 1,500 -- is not known. They may have gotten away, possibly with their leader, Osama bin Laden, whose skills at evasion continue to confound the coalition.","1948":"A videotape discovered earlier and made public by the White House last week showed Osama bin Laden at an informal gathering talking extensively about his knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Mr. Bush called that tape 'a devastating declaration of guilt for this evil person.'","1949":"If he ever meets Osama bin Laden, he said: 'I would have him arrested before he could reach my room. I would have him face a trial.'","1950":"The F.B.I.'s team here -- the only one in Afghanistan -- includes agents from New York and Washington who are devoted to the multiple, intertwined investigations into Osama bin Laden and his network. Those investigations cover not only the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but also the suicide attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October 2000 and the simultaneous bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.","1951":"Two days ago, the commanders of an eastern anti-Taliban alliance declared that their men had totally defeated the final remnants of Osama bin Laden's troops in their midst. The grim conveyance of the rotting bodies might have seemed evidence of their boasts.","1952":"MOSCOW\u2014 Anyone in Washington planning to take the war on terrorism to Iraq after Osama bin Laden is eliminated should not count on Russia's help -- at least for now. The word here when you ask about marching on Baghdad is very simple: 'Nyet.'","1953":"Since the resistance of Al Qaeda fighters in Tora Bora began to crumble in recent days, the United States has been pressing, with mixed results, to seal possible escape routes for Osama bin Laden and other leaders of his terrorist group.","1954":"Escalating tensions -- or worse yet, an outbreak of war -- between the two nuclear-armed nations could distract, if not destabilize Pakistan when the United States needs the help of its military government to capture Osama bin Laden, who may escape from southern Afghanistan into Pakistan -- if he hasn't already.","1955":"Now, as part of his consultations with intermediaries, Colonel Qadaffi was said to have offered intelligence information on members of Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorist organization, including a number of Libyans who are said to have served on Mr. bin Laden's personal protection force.","1956":"TORA BORA, Afghanistan, Dec. 19\u2014 Frustrated by the failure to capture Osama bin Laden, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan has proposed that United States marines or Army troops be deployed to comb the wild terrain of Tora Bora to try to determine the fate of Al Qaeda leaders, American officials said today.","1957":"General Musharraf must crack down on terrorist groups operating in his own country. Urgent action is needed after the attack last week on India's Parliament, attributed by India to militant groups in Pakistan. In addition, hundreds of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters have slipped into Pakistan's mountainous northwestern frontier, where there is strong resistance to General Musharraf's embrace of America. Troops loyal to Osama bin Laden clashed with their Pakistani captors yesterday.","1959":"Some now say they sharply disagreed with his decision not to hand over Osama bin Laden to the United States after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, according to one person close to several Taliban leaders. He said he had spoken with some of them in recent days.","1960":"ADEN, Yemen, Dec. 19\u2014 Troop reinforcements moved into the remote hills of central Yemen today where government forces have battled tribesmen in an assault to capture suspected operatives of Osama bin Laden.","1961":"PARIS, Dec. 19\u2014 Belgian police have arrested a Tunisian-born man they say had intense contacts with Muslim militants across Europe and recruited men for training in the camps of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","1962":"The Pakistanis find their situation particularly distressing, Mr. Ahmad said. The United States has relied on Pakistan in its battle against the Taliban and in the search for Osama bin Laden.","1963":"That would seem to sum up the news out of Afghanistan in the last few days, which is why the United States military there, frustrated by the fruitless search for Osama bin Laden, has asked the Pentagon to send more troops to scour the caves and tunnels of Tora Bora.","1964":"The capture or killing of Osama bin Laden is a finite goal with a finite result. The larger and more difficult goal is battling the poverty and despair in the Middle East that turn the disenfranchised to Osama bin Laden's radical solutions.","1965":"His words presented a warning to Pakistan's military rulers and to countries in the United States-led coalition to press for action against militants acting openly in Pakistan. Many here fear that if diplomatic action fails, India will take action that could lead to war. That, in turn, would distract Pakistan from the hunt for Osama bin Laden at a crucial time, when he is on the run, perhaps to Pakistan.","1966":"FORCES IN YEMEN -- Troop reinforcements moved into the remote hills of central Yemen, where government forces have battled tribesmen in an effort to capture suspected operatives of Osama bin Laden. B2","1967":"'Newt was a lot easier' to caricature, said Senator John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat from Louisiana whom the White House has tried to co-opt in its search for a compromise stimulus plan. 'It was not a lot of heavy lifting. Tom is not a good target. He's not someone you can put up on a wall like Osama bin Laden. He's nice, he's likable, he's genuine.'","1968":"THE VIDEOTAPE -- A government translator said a more meticulous review of the videotape released last week revealed that Osama bin Laden uttered the names of more of the hijackers than previously disclosed. B3","1969":"All in all, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, or I.S.I., is responsible for many more killings than Osama bin Laden.","1970":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 20\u2014 In the videotape released by the United States last week, Osama bin Laden uttered the names of more of the hijackers in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack than previously disclosed, a translator working for the government said tonight.","1971":"Frustrated that his image has been battered since he left office, Mr. Clinton summoned several of his aides and advisers on Wednesday to devise ways to remind the public of his accomplishments and defend his legacy against criticism on matters including his role in the current recession and his failure to strike a fatal blow against Osama bin Laden or his terrorist network after the embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998.","1972":"There were few new developments on the Afghan war front today. For the third consecutive day, scores of American warplanes were sent into the skies over Tora Bora, the mountainous redoubt where Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding last week, and Kandahar, the former Taliban stronghold in the south, without dropping any bombs.","1973":"The United States has also asked its allies to freeze the assets of another Pakistani group that is run by two nuclear scientists who visited Osama bin Laden earlier this year.","1974":"It's hardly surprising that Osama bin Laden's trail went cold shortly after the United States publicly announced that it had been tracking him through intercepted radio transmissions. This is one case where our interests would have been better served by being kept in the dark.","1975":"Prince Bandar criticized many of those reports, including the ones that have portrayed Saudi Arabia as teaching hatred of non-Muslims in its schools and paying protection money to supporters of Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident.","1976":"But the situation is highly complicated. The group Mr. Bush took aim at today, Lashkar-e-Taiba, has been linked to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization, by American officials but has never appeared on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations. It has been supported by elements of the Pakistani Army, including the Inter-Services Intelligence branch. It is one of more than a dozen insurgent groups fighting India in the Himalayan state of Kashmir, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan.","1977":"The first duty of any law enforcement or military officer is to 'know your enemy.' Yet President Bush continues to refer to Osama bin Laden and his associates, like those on the videotape of Mr. bin Laden released last week, merely as 'evil people' -- the sort of simplistic moral denunciation that only makes the behavior of terrorists more incomprehensible by ascribing to them vague and inaccurate motives. The Justice Department continues to view Mr. bin Laden's terrorist followers essentially as criminals and continues to employ tactics that would seem of more use against smugglers, drug dealers or racketeers than against religious soldiers. Attorney General John Ashcroft's roundup of hundreds of supposedly suspicious aliens, a tactic worthy of a small-town police department, is revealing of a particularly archaic approach to suspect profiling.","1978":"MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 21\u2014 Somali police said today that they had arrested four Iraqi Kurds and a Palestinian for questioning over possible links to Osama bin Laden or to his Al Qaeda network or other extremist groups.","1979":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 21\u2014 An instructor at a Minnesota flight school warned the F.B.I. in August of his suspicion that a student who was later identified as a part of Osama bin Laden's terror network might be planning to use a commercial plane loaded with fuel as a weapon, a member of Congress and other officials said today.","1980":"PRISONERS AND PATIENTS -- The Pentagon said additional American troops would be sent to search the Tora Bora caves. There was still no sign of Osama bin Laden, suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, or of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, who slipped away when Kandahar fell earlier this month. Mr. bin Laden may have gone into hiding in Pakistan, though reports cited Somalia or Yemen as alternatives.","1981":"And it brought Firefighter Higgins to the place that gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, who has been blamed for the plot that killed his brother, Lt. Timothy Higgins, a firefighter who died when the World Trade Center fell. Joseph Higgins pulled his brother's body out of that wreckage.","1982":"Before and even after Sept. 11, America was not involved in the civil war in Afghanistan. Our part in the hostilities did not begin until the Taliban refused to surrender Osama bin Laden. As late as October, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said moderate Taliban leaders could be part of a new Afghan government. John Walker Lindh joined the Taliban army in May to protect what he saw as a Muslim utopia with no evident enemy in America. He had no control over later developments at higher levels.","1983":"The American bombing of Afghanistan has largely abated since anti-Taliban forces declared last weekend that they had captured the mountainous redoubt of Tora Bora, where Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda warriors were thought to be hiding. But American combat aircraft did strike a convoy west of Khost.","1984":"In the hunt for Al Qaeda members -- and their leader, Osama bin Laden -- about 50 Special Operations troops have been working with anti-Taliban forces or operating independently at Tora Bora, Pentagon and military officials said in recent days. Some British forces are also deployed.","1985":"FOREIGN FIGHTERS -- Eighteen Arab members of Al Qaeda said the ferocity of the American airstrikes on Tora Bora broke their fighting spirit and turned what had seemed to be an impregnable fortress for Osama bin Laden into a frigid, barren zone. The fighters were wounded in the raids and taken to a hospital in Jalalabad, where they gave their first interviews since being captured. B1","1986":"WASHINGTON\u2014 AS the United States ponders whether to expand the war on terrorism to Iraq, various officials and ex-officials have tried to connect the dots between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Administration officials debate the credibility of claims by Czech officials of a meeting in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence officer and Mr. bin Laden's leading suicide operative in the Sept. 11 attacks. R. James Woolsey, the former director of central intelligence, has tried to link Mr. Hussein to the anthrax attacks in America.","1987":"In the audience was Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of the United States-led campaign that brought down the Taliban and routed Osama bin Laden's terrorism network, which is blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington.","1988":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 22\u2014 Tora Bora seemed to be an impregnable fortress when Osama bin Laden controlled the high ground. For a group of patients in the public hospital here it was a frigid, barren zone where they said they were terrorized by American airstrikes.","1989":"MILITARY CAMPAIGN -- There was a price for the reliance on Afghan opposition forces on the ground, and the United States has begun paying it. Afghan commanders considered the war over when they captured the mountainous territory of Tora Bora, while American and allied forces prepared to send a large force to search its caves themselves for Al Qaeda leaders, especially Osama bin Laden. Many fighters have already escaped into Pakistan. Phase 2 in the war on terror, Page 3.","1990":"But when these private plaintiffs try to collect on their judgments, they may find themselves at odds with the the State Department. If the government has frozen a rogue nation's assets, for instance, it may want to use that property as leverage to achieve a foreign policy objective rather than handing hundreds of millions of dollars of it over to a single plaintiff and his lawyers. Relying on the 1996 change in the laws, at least one suit against Afghanistan (as well as Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban) has already been filed in federal court in New York, by a New Jersey woman on behalf of her husband, who was killed in the World Trade Center attacks. Under the 1996 law, however, cases against Afghanistan face serious obstacles, because Afghanistan was not one of the six nations on the State Department's list of sponsors of terrorism that year.","1991":"The hunt went on for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. In a Pakistan hospital, 18 foreign Al Qaeda fighters, captured and wounded, told of the hell they had faced in Tora Bora -- the ferocious American bombing, the lack of food and supplies, the terrible cold. Still, they voiced no regrets at having left their homelands to join Mr. bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks that killed 3,000 people.","1992":"Six of the top 10 queries this year were related to those topics. They included requests for information about Nostradamus, the 16th-century soothsayer who wrote that 'the third big war will begin when the big city is burning,' at No 1; CNN, the news organization, No. 2; the World Trade Center, No. 3; anthrax, No. 5; Osama bin Laden, No. 7, and Taliban, No. 9, according to the Google Zeitgeist, which tracks trends in the site's traffic patterns.","1993":"WASHINGTON\u2014 NO one knew last week whether Osama bin Laden had moved to Pakistan; he hadn't sent out change-of-address cards. But the war certainly began to shift there -- to a country where the terrain is more hospitable than Tora Bora, but the politics are a lot less forgiving for Americans.","1994":"The British-led security force will report to Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the leader of the United States Central Command, which is overseeing the American military campaign in Afghanistan. That arrangement is intended to preserve unity of command and to ensure that the new international security force does not interfere with the American-led search for Osama bin Laden. In practice, General McColl is expected to have considerable autonomy.","1995":"Re 'A Hemings Family Turns From Black, to White, to Black' (Editorial Observer, Dec. 17), by Brent Staples: Recent debate about Thomas Jefferson has been dominated by the contrast between his personal slaveholding and his public human rights vision. But after the attacks of Sept. 11, it is time to also examine the stark contrast between Jefferson's Enlightenment-era vision and Osama bin Laden's medieval one.","1996":"Mr. Karzai said American forces were welcome to stay until terrorists were ousted from his country, and he pledged again to turn over Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, if they are caught. It was still not clear if a convoy attacked by American planes last week carried Al Qaeda or Taliban leaders, as American officials said, or tribal elders heading to Kabul, as some survivors contended.","1997":"Earlier in the day, Mr. Giuliani, chosen as Time's person of the year over Osama bin Laden, said that all New Yorkers shared in his recognition. He said he was glad that the distinction had not gone to Mr. bin Laden.","1998":"Over the past two months, similar calls have cleaved hundreds of other families whose lives are tethered to Fort Drum, the northeast's biggest military installation and home to the 10th Mountain Division, the fabled quick-strike battalion whose members have been scouring Afghanistan's craggy terrain in search of Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda. Although a spokesman for the base would not discuss troop deployments, Army officials say at least 1,000 men and women from the division have been sent to Central Asia since October, with many others poised to join them.","1999":"'Let Bush do what he will; our duty as Muslims is to follow the teachings of the holy prophet,' Mr. Minhas said during an hour-long tour of the campus in which he waved away any questions relating to the activities of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the attacks of Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden or the disputed territory of Kashmir, where Lashkar's Islamic fighters have been challenging Indian rule for much of the past decade. 'We are not frightened of Bush, we are only fearful of God.'","2000":"In Pakistan, the thinking goes, the United States cannot afford a war between India and Pakistan that would jeopardize the hunt for Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda leaders who may have fled into Pakistan; so the Americans will press India to settle for a tough diplomatic strategy.","2001":"THE PRISONERS -- The four terrorists convicted of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa have been moved to the most secure federal prison in the country, the so-called Super Max in Florence, Colo. B6","2002":"In 1998, President Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on a complex near where the convoy was hit, after learning that Osama bin Laden was scheduled to meet there with 200 to 300 other members of Al Qaeda.","2003":"The four terrorists convicted of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa have been moved to the most secure federal prison in the United States, the so-called Super Max in Florence, Colo., officials said.","2004":"ADMITTING IGNORANCE -- Other than searching vainly for Osama bin Laden, nothing has frustrated Americans as much as the unsolved mystery of this fall's anthrax outbreak, which infected 18 people and killed 5 others. And if ordinary Americans are frustrated, imagine the anguish of the nation's medical detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, caught flat-footed time and again.","2005":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 25\u2014 As the hunt for Osama bin Laden continues on both sides of the border between Afghanistan's Tora Bora district and the adjacent tribal regions of Pakistan, a succession of speculative and unsubstantiated reports have surfaced suggesting that the Qaeda leader may already be dead as a result of American bombing or even illness.","2006":"REPORTS OF BIN LADEN'S DEATH -- As the search for the Qaeda leader continues, unsubstantiated reports about Osama bin Laden's possible death are flourishing. Officials and news organizations in the Pakistan, the United States and Afghanistan have speculated that bin Laden might have been killed in bombing at Tora Bora or by long-standing illness.

Hamid Mir, a Pakistani editor with close links to Osama bin Laden, said the Jaish leader had told him that he was picked up by Pakistani police for questioning, then released. --------------------","2011":"Washington's Hitlerization of Mullah Omar mistakenly conflates him with Osama bin Laden, the real villain. Mr. bin Laden is a master terrorist, while Mullah Omar is a two-bit tyrant. Mullah Omar gave refuge to Mr. bin Laden and free use of his country, and all this helped Al Qaeda and the cause of terrorism. But no evidence has emerged that Mullah Omar himself engaged in international terrorism or even knew anything about it, and he is so unworldly that it is difficult to imagine him having a clue how Al Qaeda operated.","2012":"It would be nice to see the leaders of Pakistan and India act with the same good judgment. As Indian forces have cracked down on an uprising in disputed Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state, Pakistan has too freely permitted groups operating on its soil to send forces into Kashmir to support the rebellion. Gen. Pervez Musharraf is only the latest Pakistani leader to call these warriors 'freedom fighters' over whom he has little control. In fact, there is every reason to believe that Pakistani military and intelligence forces encourage and even direct these groups, just as Pakistan aided the Taliban and Osama bin Laden before Sept. 11.","2014":"Al Qaeda is now said to control at least 20 ships, and American officials have been concerned that Osama bin Laden might use them to escape.","2015":"The hunt for Osama bin Laden continues, and the mystery of his whereabouts deepens. Al Jazeera, the Persian Gulf television network that has been the conduit for Mr. bin Laden's messages in the past, broadcast part of a 30-minute recording purported to have been made sometime in late November or early December.","2016":"JALALABAD, Afghanistan, Dec. 26\u2014 The United States military is revising a risky plan for American troops to search the caves of Tora Bora for traces of Osama bin Laden and other fighters of Al Qaeda, and is offering incentives to get Afghan forces to take the lead, American officials said today.","2017":"State Department officials said they believed that Lashkar-e-Taiba had links to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization, and that Mr. bin Laden had provided financial support to the group.","2018":"12. At year's end Osama bin Laden will be (a) still at large, assumed but only half-believed dead; (b) captured, convicted and executed after overseas trial by U.S. military tribunal; (c) standing criminal trial in regular U.S. judicial system.","2019":"The rally lost steam before the closing bell, however, after reports that al Jazeera broadcast a videotape showing Osama bin Laden making new comments on the attacks he is suspected of masterminding.","2020":"SEARCH IS ALTERED -- The United States military has revised a risky plan for American troops to search the caves of Tora Bora for traces of Osama bin Laden and other fighters of Al Qaeda, and is once again urging local forces to take the lead. Just last Friday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he was ordering hundreds more American troops to join Afghan militia in the hunt. A1","2021":"He said it suggested the possibility that Al Qaeda, the network of Osama bin Laden, could have had something to do with Saturday's event. 'Would it be wrong to think there was a connection?' Mr. Bakr said. 'I don't know that there was, but it would be wrong not to consider it.'","2022":"The result: for Osama bin Laden's most audacious strike against the United States, Europe was his forward base, Saudi Arabia his pool of recruits, the United States a vulnerable target.","2023":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 26\u2014 A new videotaped statement from Osama bin Laden that purports to have been made sometime in late November or early December shows the terrorist leader looking tired and gaunt but alive some three months after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","2024":"The major TV news networks gave Osama bin Laden's latest message significant weight yesterday, even though most of what he said was not really new.","2025":"Yet a dictator who managed to win a war and rule his country with an iron hand could not be anything like an unworldly monk. He had plenty of time to hand over Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, to avoid the war and to stay in power. But he chose to defend Osama bin Laden.","2026":"I agree with Nicholas D. Kristof's proposal to let Mullah Muhammad Omar get away (column, Dec. 26). The more I hear about Mullah Omar's relationship with Osama bin Laden, the more I conclude that Osama bin Laden was merely using Mullah Omar.","2027":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Within hours of the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush said, 'We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.' From that first statement, Mr. Bush shaped a grand strategy for the war on terrorism that is as transforming of American policy as was Ronald Reagan's pledge to consign an 'evil empire' to the 'ash heap of history.' It breaks with the past by taking aim at states harboring terrorists as well as at terrorists themselves. It is why we have destroyed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan even as we hunt down Osama bin Laden himself. It is why the war against terrorism cannot be won if Saddam Hussein continues to rule Iraq.","2028":"THE MANHUNT -- An Afghan defense official said Osama bin Laden had escaped the country and was hiding in the mountainous border region of Pakistan. The Pentagon dismissed the report but said it had no idea of his whereabouts. A1","2029":"More than 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11. Mullah Muhammad Omar allowed Osama bin Laden to use his country to plan these killings.","2030":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 27\u2014 An Afghan defense official said tonight that Osama bin Laden had escaped the country and was hiding in the mountainous border region of Pakistan. The Pentagon dismissed the report but said it had no idea of his whereabouts.","2031":"Mr. Loiseau's frozen body, found in a rumpled heap in the rocky pass that might, in better weather, have led him from the mountain fortress crushed by B-52's to safety or imprisonment in Pakistan, was the proof of something the French have suspected all along: that young French Muslims have been fighting by the side of Osama bin Laden in 'the Foreign Legion of Al Qaeda.'","2032":"Of course, one can't help sympathizing with India. Nobody deserves having a prickly and unstable country like Pakistan next door. Pakistan's intelligence service killed more people in terrorist incidents over the years than Osama bin Laden did.","2033":"PARIS\u2014 Late last July in Afghanistan, after months of terrorist training, Jamal Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman, was summoned to the home of a senior aide to Osama bin Laden.","2034":"BIN LADEN'S WHEREABOUTS -- As criticism of the American bombing grows in Afghanistan, an Afghan defense official added a twist to the search for Osama bin Laden by saying the terrorist leader had escaped into Pakistan. The official said Mr. bin Laden was under protection of the fundamentalist Jamiat-e-Ulema-i-Islam party, which has supported Islamic extremists for a decade.","2035":"But hearsay and other kinds of evidence that would typically be excluded in civilian trials would be allowed at the tribunals. The standard the regulations provide would allow the military judges to consider any evidence that 'a reasonable person' would find useful. That means that evidence like the videotape of Osama bin Laden boasting of the Sept. 11 attacks and any intelligence interceptions would be admissible.","2036":"Following are excerpts from the most recent videotape by Osama bin Laden, as translated by Agence France-Presse. Additional excerpts are available on the Web at nytimes.com/world.","2037":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 27\u2014 Osama bin Laden's latest videotaped statement was delivered to an Arab television network two days ago from Pakistan by the DHL express package company, in an apparent break with the terrorist leader's past practices of using personal couriers to deliver messages to the outside world, according to a network executive and American officials.","2039":"But what about Mr. Walker's prior actions in the training camps, financed by Osama bin Laden, where non-Afghan members of the Taliban learned how to use explosives and poisons? Because the law was not changed until October, his prior actions would not have been in violation of it. The Constitution prohibits punishing people for acts which, at the time they were committed, were not illegal.","2040":"But these days, Mr. Push is embracing television to the point where just about anybody who watches cable news regularly has seen him, whether he is reacting to Osama bin Laden's so-called home video or calling for more financial support for families of the terror attack victims.","2041":"But the American strategy also had a decided drawback: the decision to let proxy forces bear the brunt of the ground fighting may have allowed many Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, and possibly Osama bin Laden himself, to escape.","2042":"KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 28\u2014 Speculation intensified today over the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, when Pakistan rebutted an assertion by Afghanistan's defense minister that Mr. bin Laden was in Peshawar, just inside Pakistan.","2043":"ONLY ONE DRAWBACK -- The novel strategy adopted by the United States in Afghanistan -- have American commandos organize the Afghan resistance and direct punishing air strikes -- was a striking success. It toppled the Taliban, led to the installation of a friendly government and ensured that Al Qaeda could no longer use Afghanistan as a base for terrorism. But it had one drawback: the decision to let proxy forces bear the brunt of the ground fighting may have allowed many Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, possibly Osama bin Laden himself, to escape, thus denying the United States one of its chief goals -- bringing Mr. bin Laden to justice. A1","2044":"Mr. Bush said again today that the United States would bring Osama bin Laden to justice either 'dead or alive.' The president conceded that he did not know Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts, including whether he had escaped to Pakistan or 'whether he's in a cave with the door shut or a cave with the door open.'","2045":"Q. Can you say with confidence now that Osama bin Laden is no longer in a position to mastermind another terrorist attack against the United States or our allies? And related to that, you've talked about 2002 being a year of war. What can you say to prepare the American people for, as compared to what they've seen in Afghanistan?","2046":"After 12 weeks, the war in Afghanistan seems nearly over. With the Taliban gone, Al Qaeda cut to ribbons and Osama bin Laden dead or on the run, Kabul's interim government signaled that it wanted American bombing halted soon and the fight against terrorism moved elsewhere. But matters are not quite that simple.","2047":"AL QAEDA -- The rumors regarding Osama bin Laden had him dead of natural causes, dead in a Tora Bora cave, alive under the protection of a religious leader in Pakistan and alive and hiding in the mountainous area just west of the Afghanistan border. Al Jazeera, the Arab television channel, broadcast a tape of a gaunt Mr. bin Laden, accusing the West of a campaign against Islam and praising the Sept. 11 attacks in language that places the taping in late November or early December.","2048":"Despite the success of the United States in bringing down the Taliban and Al Qaeda, it has failed so far in capturing the organizations' leaders, Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.","2049":"THE RESPONSE -- An extensive review of the nation's antiterrorism efforts shows that years before Sept. 11, terror experts in the government understood the apocalyptic designs of Osama bin Laden but never acted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be. Dozens of interviews with current and former officials show that even as the threat of terrorism mounted, the government did not marshal its full forces against it. A1","2050":"It took awhile to unlearn the number 6,000. Though the estimated death toll at the World Trade Center has been falling steadily since early October -- and has by now shrunk by half -- the smaller number proved hard to absorb. As late as Thanksgiving, the larger figure was still being cited by disc jockeys and pundits, by Northern Alliance fighters and admirers of Osama bin Laden. Maybe even now it remains embedded in the minds of Americans who have been paying less avid attention to the news than they did in September. And of those fully aware of the revised number, many seemed reluctant to adopt it. When lower death estimates were first reported, few Americans were in the mood for revisionism, even of the most benign and understandable sort. Nobody wanted to insert the word 'only' in front of a new tally of the dead. Body counts often become a proxy measure of a tragic event's significance; as the historian Karel Bartosek has written, they are 'a mathematical truth' that 'transforms mass deaths into a kind of sacrament.' Viewed in this light, insisting on precise new estimates can seem morally obtuse, beside the point. Lowering the body count can -- perversely, irrationally -- feel like a sad thing, as if it were an exercise in diminishing the weight of Sept. 11.","2051":"An extensive review of the nation's antiterrorism efforts shows that for years before Sept. 11, terror experts throughout the government understood the apocalyptic designs of Osama bin Laden. But the top leaders never reacted as if they believed the country was as vulnerable as it proved to be that morning.","2052":"It would be easy to go on about the things Mr. Giuliani failed to do -- New York City has so many problems and crises and needs that all mayors leave office with far more losses than wins. The most its residents can expect of a mayor is that he -- or someday she -- accomplish one big thing, as Mayor Koch did in restoring the city's financial health. If that one achievement is important enough, it will come to stand for everything. When measured in that way, Mr. Giuliani more than did the job. He restored New Yorkers' confidence in their ability to control the city's destiny. The long years he spent fighting crime and disorder became the platform from which he showed us how to fight terrorism and Osama bin Laden.","2053":"Discussions about the roots of Christianity and Islam; the meaning of the peace testimony, or what non-Quakers understand as the pacifist position; and whether Osama bin Laden should be killed were addressed at the Wilton Friends First Day school in Connecticut, said Jennifer Christensen, a South Salem resident who teaches there.","2054":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 29\u2014 The American-backed effort to comb the caves of Tora Bora for signs of Osama bin Laden, his fighters and intelligence on terrorist attacks that might be in the works has made little progress and seems to be fading as a top priority, American and Afghan officials said today.","2055":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 29\u2014 The American-backed effort to comb the caves of Tora Bora for signs of Osama bin Laden, his fighters and intelligence on terrorist attacks that might be in the works has made little progress and seems to be fading as a top priority, American and Afghan officials said today.","2056":"The military intelligence officers added what amounted to a warning to the United States. Unless Washington can persuade India to reverse its buildup quickly, they said, Pakistan will be forced to augment its own reinforcements on the border by recalling troops from its western border with Afghanistan, where they are hunting for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda terrorists.","2057":"It is unlikely that President Bush anticipated anything like this when he went before Congress on Sept. 20 and issued his ultimatum to the rulers of the land from which Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda had directed the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 'The Taliban must act and act immediately,' he declared then. 'They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.'","2058":"Clutched in the ground where the World Trade Center once stood are the physical remains of thousands of people. Memorials and funerals have proceeded without coffins, or in some chapels, with empty ones, and in one awful case, with the wrong body. Osama bin Laden may be dead and undiscovered, like the thousands whose killings he is believed to have organized. Or he may be undead and on the run along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan.","2059":"Osama bin Laden Video Series","2060":"Retaliation came in two forms, economic and military, as the administration froze the assets of groups and individuals it accused of bankrolling the attackers. The Pentagon sent regular troops and special forces to Afghanistan to topple the Taliban leadership and find Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, the network that Washington blamed for the attacks. But the Pentagon moved into an endgame strategy with Mr. bin Laden still at large and administration officials debating whether to take the war on terrorism to Iraq and drive President Saddam Hussein from power.","2061":"WASHINGTON, Dec. 30\u2014 Representatives of Osama bin Laden contacted Iranian intelligence agents in the mid-1990's in an attempt to forge an anti-American alliance of terror between Iran and Mr. bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda, according to United States intelligence reports.","2062":"The Tirah Valley is at the foot of one of the main escape routes, and if Osama bin Laden has chosen this as his refuge, he has selected a beautiful spot.","2063":"Again there was talk, but no word, on Osama bin Laden, who has gloated on tape about killing Americans. Afghanistan's foreign minister said that Mr. bin Laden might still be in the country. Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said that he was probably still alive, maybe in Pakistan. Pakistan's foreign minister denied that, but said that if he turned up he'd be handed over to America.","2064":"AL QAEDA AND IRAN -- Representatives of Osama bin Laden contacted Iranian intelligence agents in the mid-1990's in an attempt to forge an anti-American alliance of terror between Iran and Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, according to United States intelligence reports obtained by The Times. Iranian intelligence agents responded that they were willing to meet personally with Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan, but it is unclear from the reports if such a meeting ever occurred, and if so, whether any agreement was reached.

But for the moment, the Pentagon seems prepared to let a dwindling number of Afghan soldiers do that work.","2068":"Osama bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in 1996, with the Americans already regarding him as a stateless sponsor of terrorism. Over the years he exerted ever greater influence over the Taliban. Afghanistan became a training ground for terrorists.","2069":"At 6 p.m., organizers held a special citywide bell-ringing ceremony, as the New Year's ball was raised above 1 Times Square. And whenever Osama bin Laden appeared on a nationally televised program on a big-screen monitor in Times Square, a chorus of boos ensued.","2070":"They will find quite a mix of people among the foreign prisoners who came to fight for the Taliban or for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda movement. Their individual stories indicate that it was not so much a grand design that brought them together as the simple and broad appeal that Afghanistan under the Taliban and militant Islam held for young Muslims around the world.","2071":"Mr. Bush also repeated today that Osama bin Laden would be found, even though American and Afghan officials say his trail has grown cold. 'We're going to get him and it's just a matter of time,' Mr. Bush said.","2072":"The anti-Taliban forces here have preferred negotiations over fighting with the Taliban, since members of both sides come from the same Pashtun ethnic group. As in Tora Bora, where Afghans showed little interest in searching for Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members, Americans might face the same difficulties in Baghran in their pursuit of Mullah Omar.","2073":"Baghdad, which is on a United States list of states sponsoring terrorism, has denied any link to the Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden, whom Washington accuses of planning the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","2074":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 1\u2014 Zacarias Moussaoui, the first man to be indicted on charges involving the Sept. 11 attacks, is scheduled to be in court on Wednesday to enter a plea on charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and others to murder thousands of people.","2075":"TEHRAN, Jan. 1\u2014 Iran has denied a report that it had contacts with members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, newspapers reported today.","2076":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 1\u2014 Senior officials said today that Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, had ordered the country's military intelligence agency to cut off backing for Islamic militant groups fighting in the disputed territory of Kashmir. They said future support would go only to groups with local roots that are not part of the Islamic holy war movement that has its most notorious expression in Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda.","2077":"The mission in Baghran, however, suggests diverging interests between the Americans and Afghans. As President Bush indicated on Monday, capturing Mullah Omar remains a priority for the United States, particularly since the trail of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, appears to have grown cold. The Pentagon has drawn criticism for not having posted American ground troops in the Tora Bora region to prevent Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters from fleeing.","2078":"All hail to President Bush for how he has conducted the war against Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush has emerged a far better commander in chief than anyone predicted. In the war on terrorism he has shown steely resolve, imagination, leadership and creativity. Thank you, Mr. Bush.","2079":"It's all too easy now, months after the horror of Sept. 11 and years after earlier terrorist strikes against Americans, to say what major military actions the Clinton administration might have taken against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2080":"So here is our proposal, Mr. President. We issue a formal invitation to Osama bin Laden to come to Somalia, on behalf of a fictitious warlord in some nearby town -- say, Gialalassi. Then we will announce a few sightings.","2082":"The two sites calculate statistics differently and Google has a more international flavor, yet both counted Britney Spears, Osama bin Laden, Nostradamus, Harry Potter and Anna Kournikova among the dominant personalities. Both chronicled the rise of Morpheus, the music-file sharing service, at the expense of Napster. And both found reality television dominating the television-related queries.","2083":"But there is no credible evidence that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the Sept. 11 attacks. There is no credible evidence that he has collaborated with Osama bin Laden in any of the Qaeda leader's nefarious projects.","2085":"In his statement, Mr. Mandela also questions the 'labeling of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist responsible for those acts before he has been tried and convicted,' a step that 'could also be seen as undermining some of the basic tenets of the rule of law.'","2086":"From the wide-ranging scope of the arguments today, it seems evident that the trial will provide the government with its best opportunity so far to lay out its evidence against those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and to present its full case against Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorists.","2087":"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Jan. 2\u2014 About 200 United States marines returned to their base at the Kandahar airport today after sweeping through a deserted terrorist training camp in southern Afghanistan where they recovered only small numbers of weapons and few documents belonging to Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda.","2088":"India is understandably skeptical of Pakistan's actions. It should recognize, however, that General Musharraf has already done more than many would have thought possible only a few months ago. After the Sept. 11 attacks he turned Pakistan away from its support of the Taliban in Afghanistan and has assisted in the drive to crush Al Qaeda and find Osama bin Laden. General Musharraf took those actions because of a promise of American aid and what may have been a separate promise not to install an anti-Pakistan regime in Kabul. But unlike the Taliban, the Kashmiri uprising is widely seen in Pakistan as a worthy cause, dear to many hearts. There is a chance that General Musharraf's about-face will cause elements of the armed forces and large sectors of the Islamic clergy to turn against him.","2089":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 3\u2014 Pakistani officials said today that they had arrested the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, and that he was being questioned by Pakistani and American intelligence officials seeking information on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden as well as Mullah Muhammad Omar, the former Taliban leader.","2090":"Senior Pentagon officials said a large number of non-Afghan fighters of the Qaeda military corps -- possibly including some senior commanders -- had been spotted at the camp, which was the target of a 1998 American cruise missile attack that was intended to kill Osama bin Laden. It has been struck repeatedly in the last four months.","2091":"Pakistani officials said they had arrested the former Taliban ambassador, and that Pakistani and American officials were questioning him about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar. A14","2092":"There may well have been interaction between Mr. Hussein's intelligence apparatus and various terrorist networks, including that of Osama bin Laden. But it was Mr. bin Laden's network that brought about the Sept. 11 attacks, and his agents did not come from Iraq. There is no credible public information to indicate that Iraq was significantly involved.","2093":"Mr. Karzai has shown impressive political skills while reaching out to disparate factions in shaping his government. Washington's first political priority is to shore up his authority so that Afghanistan can have a stable government that extends from one end of the country to the other. But that objective is complicated by the overriding American military priority of pursuing, capturing or killing the remaining Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, particularly Osama bin Laden.","2094":"Inside Afghanistan, the general said, American military teams have searched 40 of 48 suspected weapons-production sites, but have found no hard evidence that Osama bin Laden and his forces developed any chemical, radiological or biological arms.","2095":"As allied forces narrow their hunt for Osama bin Laden, the broader mission is creating a stable, secure Afghanistan. That will take time and resources, but President Bush can start now by drawing on one of the most effective, cost-efficient weapons in the fight against poverty: providing very small business loans to the poorest people -- especially women -- through microlending.","2096":"In Afghanistan, the United States Army is embarked on a long mission to register the prisoners and interrogate those who may be able to provide valuable information about Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorist network. Eighty-five of the prisoners in Shibarghan had been sent to the American base in Kandahar by Tuesday, Colonel Wilkerson said, but he could not say what would happen to them after that. Senior defense officials in Washington have said a new prison camp is being built at the naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, to hold senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members.","2097":"How fleeting is infamy, after all. Osama bin Laden didn't make it as Time's Man of the Year, the Taliban have been routed, been there, done that. We can take solace in the fact that there has been no major follow-up terrorist attack since Sept. 11 and so pursue cut-rate security at a leisurely pace -- all the while forgetting another part of pre-Sept. 11 history, namely that the typical interval between Al Qaeda actions is 12 to 24 months. Contrast the $8.3 billion that Congress has appropriated to domestic security with its latest 'absolute insanity' (in the words of John McCain) -- a dubious $22 billion slab of corporate pork that it bestowed upon Boeing in the form of an Air Force contract to lease 100 new wide-body jets that might be cheaper to buy outright. You can see how much our national priorities have changed since the day the world changed.","2098":"In his speech in California and at a question-and-answer session today where he roamed the stage, Mr. Bush previewed his political strategy for the coming months -- a blend of counterterrorism and counter-Daschleism. He began with an account of America's military successes in Afghanistan, mentioning Osama bin Laden once in passing. Then Mr. Bush wove to the need to back up military success with the adoption of his economic strategy.","2099":"The United States has taken custody of Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, one of Osama bin Laden's top paramilitary trainers and the most senior Al Qaeda member seized in the war in Afghanistan, American officials said. 1","2100":"In a culture that has demonstrated marked suspicion of the intellectual and always admired the frontier, with its images of eternal promise, Mr. Bush's language of the wild West, of wanting Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive,' has been derided by academics even as it was embraced by the public. Mr. Bush's first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, in November, was similarly direct, free of the usual diplomatic niceties and was praised at home, even as leaders of other nations called it blunt and U.S.-centric.","2102":"AL QAEDA -- The hunt for Osama bin Laden appears to have lost some urgency, after searches of hundreds of caves in Tora Bora yielded little information. But for two days in a row, American warplanes bombed a former Al Qaeda camp in Khost province that was the target of cruise missiles intended to kill Mr. bin Laden in 1998. Pentagon officials said Al Qaeda has been regrouping in the camp, which has been struck repeatedly in the past few months.","2103":"Michael Mullen of Old Lyme discovered the fliers when he went out to his driveway where his 10-year-old son was playing basketball. He said he stopped reading the flier after he saw the picture of Osama bin Laden, the burning World Trade Center and the headline 'Let's Stop Being Human Shields for Israel.' Some residents questioned why the group thinks it will gain support by trying to justify the terrorist attacks.","2104":"And then there is that other world where Osama bin Laden is loved and lauded, where Osama is a favored name for newborn sons and where children play Osama eluding the evil forces of America. These photographs, taken last month, show a world where Mr. bin Laden has also become a marketing tool -- for cologne in Pakistan, for a box of sweets in Afghanistan -- and where hawkers do roaring trade in Osama T-shirts and Osama posters and Osama key-rings.","2105":"Following existing precedents, an ad hoc international criminal court could quickly be established by the United Nations Security Council to try Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders for crimes against humanity. No security secrets need be revealed to justify convictions. Lesser offenders can face national tribunals or summary proceedings, as was done after World War II. The permanent international criminal court soon to be established offers a good model.","2106":"President Bush has warned us that the war on terrorism will be a long struggle. But how will we know when we've won even round one? Simple. We will have won round one once we've killed Osama bin Laden and his allies and once the leaders of the Arab-Muslim world have killed his ideas. That's the division of labor: we have to eliminate the killers and they have to delegitimate his ideas. I fear, though, that we'll do our part, but Arab-Muslim leaders won't do theirs. And if that's how round one ends, then on your next flight keep an eye on the tennis shoes of the guy next to you.","2107":"NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 5\u2014 One of Somalia's warlords sent an urgent letter to President Bush shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States telling him that there were terrorists in Somalia sympathetic to Osama bin Laden.","2108":"If Mullah Omar is no longer in Baghran, it would be another blow to the United States, which has so far failed in one of its central goals of the war: capturing the leader of the Taliban and the leader of the Qaeda terrorist network, Osama bin Laden. On Monday, President Bush re-emphasized that seizing Mullah Omar remained a priority and expressed confidence that he would be found.","2109":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 5\u2014 The United States has taken custody of one of Osama bin Laden's top paramilitary trainers, the most senior member of Al Qaeda seized in the three-month war in Afghanistan, American officials said today.","2110":"Her office also first indicted Osama bin Laden in 1998, and there are five men in custody in New York and Britain who are still expected to be tried in Manhattan on charges that they conspired in terrorism with Mr. bin Laden.","2111":"Singapore has arrested 15 Muslims and accused them of planning to blow up military targets and embassies in the small city-state. The government said at least some of them might have received training from Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al Qaeda. The government said the men had been found with bomb-making instructions, and with photographs and videotape of buildings that were apparently being considered as targets. A8","2112":"Quake III is an easy mark for such efforts. The developers of the two-year-old game have made its underlying computer code freely available, hoping that player-built tweaks will extend its lifespan. Visitors to the PlanetQuake.com site learn that the game's futuristic settings can be replaced with, for instance, a Wild West theme. Predictably, after Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden became a popular target in several games.","2113":"'The evil one': Mr. Bush has regularly used this phrase to describe Osama bin Laden. Among evangelical Christians, it is an obvious reference to Satan, and appears throughout the Bible. (From Matthew, in the New American Standard Bible: 'When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart.')","2114":"TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 6\u2014 A teenage pilot's fatal flight into a downtown skyscraper here was a deliberate gesture of support for Osama bin Laden and the hijackers who brought down the World Trade Center, the city's police chief said today.","2115":"A 15-year-old pilot's crash into a skyscraper in Tampa, Fla., on Saturday was a gesture of support for Osama bin Laden and the hijackers who brought down the World Trade Center, according to police officials, who said they had found a suicide note in the pocket of the youth, Charles J. Bishop. The White House said the incident did not appear to be a terrorist act.","2116":"Though Mr. Sharon has compared Mr. Arafat to Osama bin Laden in the past, he has not before publicly declared him to be an enemy, Israeli officials said. Still, his forceful declaration today appeared to have no immediate implications for policy. Israel continues to say it will not try to kill Mr. Arafat.","2117":"In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Turkey gained new importance to the coalition against Osama bin Laden, and for all its flaws on human rights, Turkey is a stable synthesis of democracy and Islam in a volatile Islamic world. Many regard it as a model for moderate Muslims and a counterweight to the angry voices of radicals.","2118":"TOKYO\u2014 There's just one thing that most Americans and Osama bin Laden seem able to agree on: that the attacks on the World Trade Center arose somehow from Islam. Whether the purest form of Islam or the most perverted, it so enveloped the hijackers in religious zeal that the centrality of Islam to the attacks is hard to deny.","2119":"Ms. White's remarks came in a wide-ranging interview on Saturday, and included some of her most revealing public comments about Osama bin Laden and terrorism.","2120":"'If you're looking for Osama bin Laden terrorist cells, it's hard to find them when you go to church on Sunday,' Mr. Earnest gently advised, reflecting on his clandestine years of running cold-war agents in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. 'You have to fish where the fish are.'","2121":"In an age when we hold Mullah Muhammad Omar responsible for the presence of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, we should certainly hold Yasir Arafat responsible for the order of terrorist munitions.","2122":"Mr. Bishop, a freshman at East Lake High School, stole an airplane from a flight school at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport on Saturday and crashed it into the 28th floor of the Bank of America Plaza in downtown Tampa. A note expressing sympathy for Osama bin Laden was in his pocket.","2123":"Two world-renowned figures have been on the run, living in 'undisclosed locations' since Sept. 11. There are occasional sightings of both, but then they vanish. One figure is named Osama bin Laden. The other is named Dick Cheney.","2124":"Mr. Karzai added, however, that he had not asked the United States to curtail its bombing campaign while it pursues Osama bin Laden, the elusive head of Al Qaeda, or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader.","2125":"The two Al Qaeda fighters, who were seized by American Special Forces and Central Intelligence Agency paramilitary officers near the Zawar Kili training base in Khost Province, are not top lieutenants of Osama bin Laden, officials said.","2126":"From the first days of America's new war against international terrorism, President Bush has made clear that the use of United States military force would not necessarily end with the defeat of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan or the killing or capture of Osama bin Laden. He rightly warned governments around the world that offering sanctuary to international terrorists could expose their countries to American military attack. With Osama bin Laden and other top leaders of Al Qaeda now on the run from Afghanistan, Mr. Bush needs to initiate a discussion with Congress and the American people about whether the war should be extended to other lands.","2127":"The pundits predict that he will call at a Muslim country, and one of those often mentioned is Somalia. Apart from speculations, no one has the slightest idea what the spreaders of destruction and those in hot pursuit of them will do once Afghanistan has ostensibly rid herself of Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda associates. But the assumption is that in Somalia, a land of grief, these destructive forces would find a haven because there is no central authority to flush them out, hunt them down or bring them before a court.","2128":"Aiming his M-16 assault rifle at a fleeing Arab in white robes and a long beard, the American fired -- killing Osama bin Laden. A pool of blood spread from Mr. bin Laden's head as an elite Special Forces team stood over its vanquished quarry.","2129":"That ability to disappear is what worries United States officials, who continue to search for Osama bin Laden, the head of Al Qaeda, and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban.","2130":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9\u2014 America's goals in Central Asia were easily explained as Kabul and Kandahar fell, when daily Pentagon videos showed bombs homing in on caves in Tora Bora and when there was a reasonable prospect that Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and their top aides would soon fall into American hands.","2131":"'Pakistan has not yet moved even a single soldier who is committed to duty alongside the Americans,' said a Pakistani military intelligence officer, disputing media reports that the search for Osama bin Laden and other fugitives had been crippled as the country mobilizes against India.","2132":"The governor was kicking off his own re-election campaign as much as a new season of the State Legislature. For a budgetary villain he resuscitated the era of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has been out of office for seven years. Mr. Pataki compared today's yawning state deficit, courtesy of Osama bin Laden and the recession, to the budget gaps left by Governor Cuomo in 1995. Unfair as that is, it is certainly a signal that it's election time again for Mr. Pataki.","2133":"A senior Pentagon officer said today that those forces have discovered that the fortified underground complex at Zhawar Kili was much larger than had previously been thought, perhaps 40 acres or more. Zhawar Kili was used by local Afghans fighting Soviet forces during the 1980's, and later became a major training base for Al Qaeda fighters under Osama bin Laden.","2134":"Continuing its assault on Osama bin Laden's financial network, the Bush administration announced yesterday that it was freezing assets of two groups professing humanitarian aims that officials said had funneled charitable donations to Al Qaeda instead.","2136":"BRUSSELS\u2014 Alive or dead, Osama bin Laden poses problems. If buried at the bottom of a bombed cave, we may not know his fate for some time. And while the world waits, Mr. bin Laden may become, among many Muslim militants, a modern-day version of a vanished imam, a lost spiritual guide whose hoped-for return will empower the oppressed and vanquish the strong.","2137":"East African leaders opened a summit meeting in Khartoum by urging united action against terrorists. The United States has in the past accused Sudan of helping to foster terrorism, and as it hunts Osama bin Laden, Washington has accused an Islamic group in Somalia of having links with Al Qaeda. The host of the meeting, President Omar al-Bashir, urged his colleagues to help 'shed the image' that Africa is a breeding ground for terrorists. Marc Lacey (NYT)","2138":"Senior French intelligence officials said the pattern of Mr. Reid's travels to more than half a dozen countries during the past year, his habit of paying for tickets and hotels in cash and his stint at a training camp in Afghanistan strongly suggested that he was a low-level courier for Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.","2139":"It said that the 13 suspects were members of a clandestine organization called the Islamic Group, and that 8 had received training in Afghanistan from Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden.","2140":"Mr. Massoud was killed on Sept. 9, two days before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and American officials have said they believe he was murdered by Al Qaeda operatives sent by Osama bin Laden.","2141":"Fearful that a war could imperil the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, President Bush, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain have been publicly pressuring Pakistan to crack down on extremist groups.","2142":"While some individual Nunn-Lugar programs have suffered from poor administration, their overall achievement has been undeniably impressive. For a total of less than $7 billion since 1991, Washington has helped finance not only the deactivation of more than 5,500 nuclear warheads from Russia and other former Soviet republics, but also the employment of Russian nuclear scientists who might otherwise have sold their services to Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden, as well as some badly needed tightening of security at Russian plutonium and bomb-grade uranium storage facilities. Nunn-Lugar money has also been used to begin dismantling Russia's biological weapons plants. Much more needs to be done, especially in the area of accounting for and protecting plutonium and uranium, which remain vulnerable to diversion or theft. Much of the increased funding the administration plans to request is rightly targeted at addressing this continuing danger.","2143":"These are the kinds of uncomfortable questions Jon Ronson raises in his often entertaining, more often disturbing, book 'Them.' Ronson, a writer and documentary filmmaker in Britain, insinuated himself into the homes and graces of a variety of conspiracy theorists and 'extremists,' whom he defines as those who 'have been called extremists by others.' The project began with Omar Bakri Mohammed, who is said to be Osama bin Laden's 'man in London.' Ronson went on to ingratiate himself with American Klansmen, neo-Nazis and the New World Order conspiracy theorists, some of whom he joins in the quest for the one 'secret room' where a conclave of rulers supposedly plots the conspiracies that control the world.","2144":"To the degree there has to be a villain, Osama bin Laden fits the bill in a way that makes it even more difficult for Democrats to pin the blame on Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans. So rather than attacking Mr. Bush as directly responsible for rising unemployment, Democrats are concentrating their attacks on Mr. Bush's role in the dissipation of the budget surplus.","2145":"NEWS flash: Osama bin Laden is still missing. Congress considers education package. Santa's reindeer are probably female.","2146":"AL QAEDA -- Still frustrated in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar and concerned that Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters might be trying to regroup, allied forces combed the area around Khost, along the Pakistan border. They repeatedly bombed a training camp at Zhawar Kili, where they found an astonishing 40-acre underground complex that raised concerns that other vast, unseen bulwarks may be sheltering fighters.","2148":"While the United States has not decided what role, if any, to play in a multinational peacekeeping force, it has been reluctant to commit troops to operations other than those aimed at capturing Osama bin Laden and destroying his network, Al Qaeda.","2149":"There is no reason to believe the current President Bush's approval scores will begin to slide. The war effort in Afghanistan is judged a success by most Americans, and the failure to capture Osama bin Laden is not likely to be held against Mr. Bush. If anything, Mr. bin Laden's elusiveness will serve to perpetuate public concerns about another terrorist attack, which in turn will sustain feelings of national unity and support for the president. The use of force in Somalia or Sudan would probably produce the same result.","2150":"KABUL, Afghanistan\u2014 I've got good news and bad news from Afghanistan. The good news is that America doesn't need a lot to satisfy its basic security interest here, which is that this distant land never again be so uncontrolled that a tumor like Osama bin Laden can grow in its midst and then metastasize into the world and threaten us. We really don't need much to get that -- just a loose Afghan federal government, some basic police and army units, a functioning economy and a few institutions.","2151":"As the United States scours the world for terrorists who might be linked to Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network -- or might provide its members with refuge and support -- Abu Sayyaf has come under increasing suspicion.","2152":"These no-account accountants seem to forget that the 'p' in C.P.A. means 'public.' The Big Five are silent about Andersengate because they are eager to become the Big Four by carving up their competitor's carcass. That's why it's harder to find a major bean-counter willing to condemn publicly the failures of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. than to find a top Muslim cleric willing to criticize Osama bin Laden.","2153":"But just as we still stare helpless into our television screens, hoping for some glimpse of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, so this eager knight peers into fog, seeing only 'the huge snout of nothingness.'","2154":"American officials in Washington have previously said that a top official from the C.I.A. held secret talks with his Syrian counterparts about helping the United States investigate and uproot Osama bin Laden's network, Al Qaeda.","2155":"On Friday, the government described the men -- whom it said it had arrested last month -- as members of a clandestine organization called the Islamic Group, with links to Al Qaeda, the network led by Osama bin Laden.","2157":"General Musharraf's speech was the second critical turnabout for Pakistan since Sept. 11. The first came when, under American pressure, Pakistan ended its support of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Repudiating the Taliban and Osama bin Laden was widely supported throughout Pakistan. Ending support for Muslim guerrillas in the disputed Indian state of Kashmir may not be so popular. General Musharraf made a powerful case for it, saying that ending support for groups attacking civilians in India offered the best path toward changing Indian policy on Kashmir.","2158":"The purpose of the accords is to establish a stable government, which means ending direct supplies of money and arms to warlords. Yet the United States has been supporting various anti-Taliban commanders who are helping in the search for Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden. In the battle for Kandahar the United States came close to undermining Hamid Karzai, now head of the interim Kabul administration, by arming his local rivals. The immediate operational requirements of the battle against Al Qaeda and the Taliban have thus worked against the goal of consolidating the interim administration's authority.","2159":"While the American government does not want to become a mediator in the Kashmir dispute, it fears the consequences of a war between India and Pakistan, and does not want resources and attention diverted from its own global campaign to crush the terror network of Osama bin Laden.","2160":"Even before today, Badr said, likenesses of Mr. Karmi outsold all his other offerings, most of which go for a little more than a dollar. The Palestinian Authority will not permit him to sell items showing Osama bin Laden, he said, but that does not much matter. 'People don't ask for bin Laden,' he said. 'They ask for Raed Karmi.'","2161":"Mr. Walker learned of the plans while completing a seven-week course in a Qaeda training camp. There, he met at least once with Osama bin Laden, who 'thanked him for taking part in jihad,' the affidavit said.","2162":"The Bush administration is doing the right thing by prosecuting John Walker in a civilian court rather than a military tribunal or a court-martial for his association with the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. The charges the government has brought against the young American, including conspiring to kill United States soldiers in Afghanistan and aiding a terrorist group, seem more appropriate than treason, which can bring a death sentence. Mr. Walker will face extremely serious charges that could be punished by life imprisonment. As the case proceeds, the Justice Department must ensure that he receives a fair trial.","2163":"If that becomes the case, does it make much difference if caps are sold on the sidewalk or in officially sanctioned stores? Indeed, given the crowds at ground zero, the vendors there make it considerably easier to outfit the world in N.Y.P.D and F.D.N.Y. caps. It's not as if they are selling Osama bin Laden dolls.","2164":"WASHINGTON, Jan. 15\u2014 Evidence of their link with Al Qaeda is sketchy: There were meetings some years ago with a brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, and some contact with one of the terrorists now imprisoned in the United States for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.","2165":"At a news conference today, Attorney General John Ashcroft said Mr. Walker had voluntarily told F.B.I. interviewers that he met Osama bin Laden in a small group and knew that Mr. bin Laden had ordered the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","2166":"Unfortunately, these aren't the only fighting roosters strutting around the Afghan ruins. There's also the human variety -- the Afghan warlords, and the neighboring powers that support them, who've been fighting over Afghanistan for two decades. The reason the Afghan war went so smoothly for the U.S. was because the geopolitical roosters -- Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia -- either overtly or tacitly cooperated with us to destroy the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, which was in each of their interests. And the local roosters -- the key Tajik, Pashtun, Hazara and Uzbek warlords -- did the same.","2167":"Or perhaps, some lawyers suggested, Mr. Walker will try a political defense, arguing, like Osama bin Laden, that his actions were justified by American behavior around the world.","2168":"These officials have become increasingly frustrated that American policy has been so focused on Osama bin Laden that it has not paid enough attention to other dangerous men like Mr. Mugniyah, who now has the same American price tag on his head as Mr. bin Laden -- $25 million.","2169":"But in a swath of eastern Afghanistan, where sympathies still generally favor the routed Taliban regime, American entreaties have often been greeted with cold stares and suspicion, officials said. The region is just south of Tora Bora, where hundreds of American and British commandos and Afghan militia searched fruitlessly vain for Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda fighters.","2170":"*Reuel Marc Gerecht, a C.I.A. veteran in the Middle East who quit out of frustration, criticized agency officials for perpetrating the myth that America had an effective counterterrorism program against Osama bin Laden. In an article published last summer in The Atlantic Monthly, he argued that not a single C.I.A. officer had the skills and willingness to infiltrate bin Laden's operations in the mountains of Afghanistan. 'Operations that include diarrhea as a way of life don't happen,' a young C.I.A. case officer told him. Mr. Gerecht predicted that unless one of Osama bin Laden's 'foot soldiers walks through the door of a U.S. consulate or embassy, the odds that a C.I.A. counterterrorist officer will ever see one are extremely poor.' He criticized George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, for assuring the public that the C.I.A.'s efforts were keeping bin Laden's terrorists 'off-balance.'","2171":"On Sept. 11, 133 of our employees woke up and went to work, never to return home. Each of our companies was located in Two World Trade Center -- Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods on the 88th and 89th floors and Sandler O'Neill on the 104th floor. Our firms were among a group of companies with offices in the World Trade Center whose rosters of employees read like a Who's Who of the financial sector of the economy. They were exactly the kind of people Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda wanted to target. Their families are now dealing with both grief and enormous financial challenges.","2172":"Second, the war has led many Americans to feel that Saudi Arabia is not the best of allies. The Saudi regime -- undemocratic, an exporter of fundamentalism that is also hated by some of its own fundmentalists, like Osama bin Laden -- is important to the West because of its oil. Accordingly, to lessen Western dependence on Saudi (not to mention Iraqi) oil can only be to the good. The route to greater independence may well lead through Afghanistan.","2174":"Saudi Arabia first backed Islamic rebels battling Soviet occupation forces in the 1980's and then supported the Taliban from 1996. The Saudi government froze diplomatic ties with the Taliban in 1998 over the presence of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and severed relations completely two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.","2175":"LONDON, Jan. 17\u2014 After months of investigation, the British authorities today charged two Algerian men arrested last September with membership in Osama bin Laden's terrorist network -- the first formal link drawn here between Al Qaeda and Islamic extremists alleged to be operating in this country.","2176":"It was the first time that a Filipino official had disclosed that Mr. Bush had offered American troops to fight on Philippine soil against the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, who have been linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. A White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, declined to comment on the report.","2177":"At a Justice Department news conference, Mr. Ashcroft said the statements were made on five hourlong videotapes found by American special forces in the rubble of a compound occupied by Muhammad Atef, one of Osama bin Laden's chief commanders. Military officials have said Mr. Atef was killed in an airstrike on Kabul in November.","2178":"While there is a long history of separatist unrest among Muslims in the southern Philippine islands, Abu Sayyaf is a fringe group with limited political support. Some of its 500 or so members appear at least loosely connected with Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda figures, and Abu Sayyaf is responsible for plenty of terrorism on its own. Its trademark is kidnapping, and it currently holds an American missionary couple.","2179":"President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan said in an interview published in Pakistani newspapers that Osama bin Laden might have died of kidney failure or in a bombing raid, or might still be hiding in Afghanistan. A8","2180":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 18\u2014 President Pervez Musharraf said in an interview published here today that Osama bin Laden might have died of kidney failure in a cave in Afghanistan after becoming separated from a dialysis machine he had used in recent years.","2181":"In General Musharraf's meeting today, he tried to clarify reports that he had said Osama bin Laden was dead, saying he had no specific knowledge of his location or situation. His comments, he said, were based solely on his 'judgment and perception.' He said he was influenced by a Pakistani intelligence report that Mr. bin Laden had two kidney dialysis machines sent into Afghanistan, one for his personal use and the other for Afghans.","2182":"While refugees of every race, ethnicity and religion will be investigated, the government will focus on men who are 14 to 65 years old from countries where Al Qaeda, the terrorist group run by Osama bin Laden, has been operating, officials said.","2183":"In the push to rid the world of Osama bin Laden and his ilk, the role of men like Dr. Hishmet and the Brotherhood, the forebear of all Islamic groups, remains uncertain.","2184":"PHILADELPHIA\u2014 One consequence of Osama bin Laden's attack on America that was surely unintentional was turning Donald Rumsfeld into a folk hero. But strange things happen during wars, and televised press briefings have won the famously brusque secretary of defense a special place in the nation's heart. Last month a cover profile in U.S. News &amp; World Report called him 'the Pentagon's answer to Harry Truman' -- a 'straight-talking Midwesterner' who 'routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter.'","2185":"The incident provided material all week for late-night comics. 'All this time we're worried about Osama bin Laden,' Jay Leno cracked on Monday. 'It turns out he was almost done in by Mr. Salty.'","2188":"Across Afghanistan today, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, Mullah Muhammad Omar and Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters continued. American warplanes patrolled the skies, but there were no airstrikes overnight, officials said.","2190":"BEIJING, Jan. 21\u2014 Seeking to justify its harsh treatment of Muslims living in China's far western region of Xinjiang, Chinese officials asserted today that a small separatist movement there was being financed and supported by Osama bin Laden and that more than 100 terrorists who had trained at camps in Afghanistan had been arrested in China.","2191":"Yet, some of the city's elders are coming to believe, it is precisely that tolerance that may have provided Osama bin Laden's organization Al Qaeda with the cover to implant a secretive network here of Algerian militants that blended easily among Muslims of many backgrounds.","2192":"JAKARTA, Jan. 22\u2014 For the last two years, Osama bin Laden has been working to establish a beachhead here in the world's most-populous Muslim nation, say American and Asian officials. Members of his organization Al Qaeda have slipped in and out of the archipelago, bringing millions of dollars in cash for radical Islamic organizations, recruiting members, and providing military training, those officials say.","2193":"American and Asian officials say Osama bin Laden has been working to establish a beachhead in Indonesia, the world's most-populous Muslim nation. A1","2194":"On the way back from Kabul, I passed through Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, London and Belgium, where I had a variety of talks with Arab and Muslim journalists and business people and Muslim community leaders in Europe. All of them were educated, intelligent and thoughtful -- and virtually none of them believed that Osama bin Laden was guilty.","2195":"Among them, the officials said, was Abu Zubaydah, the operations chief for Al Qaeda, who was believed to be one of a handful of men entrusted with running the terrorism network in the event of Osama bin Laden's death or capture.","2196":"Some American officials are worried that Abu Sayyaf has links to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Five Islamic extremists have been arrested this month and a ton of explosives found.","2197":"By those criteria, Osama bin Laden should be at the head of the list. Mr. Posner's whole enterprise is worthless.","2198":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman ascribes Arab-Muslim sympathy for Osama bin Laden to a 'cultural resistance to believing anything good about America.' Mr. Friedman does not distinguish between American society and United States government actions around the world.","2199":"There still remains some Saudi popular support for Osama bin Laden -- and for his demand that 'infidel' American troops quit the birthplace of Islam. Although Saudi and American leaders have denied recent media reports that Saudi Arabia might soon ask American forces to leave, some of the 5,000 soldiers here harbor lingering security concerns.","2200":"One of the first and most troubling questions to arise after Sept. 11 was whether Osama bin Laden represented a fanatical aberration of an otherwise humane and tolerant faith or whether he was the cutting edge of a dangerous and swelling sentiment in Islam. The question revealed a considerable ignorance about Islam in America and placed a high premium on those few with genuine expertise in the field.","2201":"JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 24\u2014 An Islamic cleric who was questioned here today by the police after Singapore and Malaysia demanded his arrest lauded Osama bin Laden as 'a true Islamic warrior' who had shown the courage and skill to fight the United States.","2202":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman cites some of the absurd conspiracy theories surfacing in the Muslim world holding that Osama bin Laden is not guilty of the Sept. 11 atrocities -- for example, that it was an American plot to smear the Saudis.","2203":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman says that in recent talks with a variety of Arab and Muslim journalists, business people and community leaders, he found 'virtually none' who believed that Osama bin Laden was guilty.","2204":"In 'Run, Osama, Run' (column, Jan. 23), Thomas L. Friedman ascribes Arab-Muslim sympathy for Osama bin Laden to a 'cultural resistance to believing anything good about America.' Mr. Friedman does not distinguish between American society and United States government actions around the world.","2205":"Hanging in the balance is the future of a young man who converted to Islam from Catholicism in 1997 at 16. While his advocates have portrayed his life as a spiritual quest, the complaint against him said that during questioning in Afghanistan Mr. Lindh said he had trained in explosives and firearms at a terrorist camp run by Al Qaeda, had fought shoulder to shoulder with the Taliban before he was captured, had met with Osama bin Laden and knew that Mr. bin Laden had ordered suicide attacks against the United States.","2206":"The federal judge who presided in the trial of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the terrorist convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, has been assigned the future trials in the 1998 embassy bombings conspiracy that prosecutors say was led by Osama bin Laden.","2207":"But even when he took the stand in his trial in November, the frail general, who wears a patch over one eye, described torture as useful and was unrepentant. 'My actions appeared justified,' he told the court, adding that he would do the same thing again today 'if it were against Osama bin Laden.'","2208":"The plot was foiled when 13 members were arrested. During questioning, officials say, they described a well-organized network stretching across Southeast Asia and perhaps into Australia. The early glimpses uncovered by authorities in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore suggest that the network rivaled in reach and sophistication the one formed by Osama bin Laden's lieutenants in Europe.","2209":"When Mr. Baer left Tajikistan in 1995, he was not replaced by someone with the necessary language skills to cultivate an agent close to the Islamic chieftain Abdullah Nuri, who fought the Russians in Afghanistan and subsequently arranged a meeting between Iranian officials and Osama bin Laden intended to plan anti-American acts.","2210":"He said he saw Osama bin Laden come for frequent meetings with Mullah Omar. 'They had private meetings during the night and no one could go in,' he said. But he said that Mr. bin Laden's influence was not overwhelming. 'The head was Mullah Omar and he made the decisions,' the younger Mr. Hekmati said. 'He was not a good leader and not a good person. In all of the Taliban no one behaved as badly as he. I started to think how could we bring new people, who would know how to make our country prosper.'","2211":"In a wide-ranging interview, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz, the kingdom's director of the intelligence service, also acknowledged that after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the vast majority of Saudi young adults felt considerable sympathy for the cause of the Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Laden, even though they rejected the attacks in New York and Washington.","2213":"In the Muslim world, it seems that Osama bin Laden is now a fractured idol, and many Muslim scholars criticize him. Yet he also remains appealing to others, almost as a political Robin Hood.","2215":"Down the other side of the peaks is the cave-riddled region called Tora Bora, where the Americans bombed for weeks in pursuit of Osama bin Laden and sent hundreds of his Qaeda fighters fleeing. The soldiers here still hear the rumble of American warplanes, prowling Afghanistan's jagged border zone for remnants of enemy forces.","2216":"It was completed, one must emphasize, some time before Sept. 11. Scholars of international and Middle Eastern affairs like Lewis did not need Osama bin Laden's attacks, the subsequent war against the Taliban and revelations of our shaky, ambivalent friendships with Pakistan or Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to recognize that things were out of joint between the West and much of the Muslim world. What the events of the past few months did was to call this enormous problem to the attention of a far wider audience.","2217":"BRUSSELS\u2014 For all that has been written about Sept. 11, there is still one big hole in our knowledge: We know who Osama bin Laden is. He is a unique cult figure -- a Muslim Charles Manson with the organizational skills of Jack Welch. We also know who bin Laden's passive supporters are -- all those Muslims who sympathize with him out of anger with their own leaders, America or Israel. But who were the guys in the middle -- the killer pilots who went beyond passive support to become suicidal mass murderers?","2219":"Will he mention Osama bin Laden, even though Mr. Bush has still not made good on his vow to catch him 'dead or alive'? (Bush advisers said they would emphasize that there can be no wavering from the war on terrorism.)","2220":"The real problem is interrogation. If designated as P.O.W.'s, Al Qaeda men and Taliban leaders -- many of whom may be able to name other Osama bin Laden confederates already assigned to new attacks -- would be required only to state name, rank and serial number. They would then claim not only the right to remain silent, but also the right be freed when the 'war' ended -- despite active participation in a criminal conspiracy to kill civilians.","2221":"Ms. Belkacem said she never even saw her husband with a mobile phone: how then could he have made repeated cellular calls to one of Osama bin Laden's top aides after Sept. 11, as United States officials allege?","2222":"Mr. Karzai said his administration was assisting in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.","2223":"'The Justice Department is reminding everyone that our terrorist threat goes beyond Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda,' a senior federal law enforcement official said. 'There are domestic threats as well. I think it's fair to say we'd like more of everything, from uniformed people on the ground to sniffer dogs to surveillance cameras.'","2224":"It would be unwise to alter our policy dramatically while the war on Al Qaeda continues. Indeed, a sharp change now might be seen as rewarding Osama bin Laden. But quietly, over time, the United States and Saudi Arabia should begin talks to reduce the American military presence, because our mutual interests will require that change.","2225":"Those strains were exposed more starkly when 15 of the 19 suspected hijackers were identified as Saudi citizens apparently wreaking terror at the behest of Osama bin Laden, who is Saudi-born but was stripped of his citizenship years ago.","2226":"A lawyer for a man suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden told a federal district judge in Manhattan yesterday that he wanted his client's trial moved from New York City because jurors may be prejudiced by the Sept. 11 terror attack on the World Trade Center.","2227":"A lawyer for Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who is suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden, told a federal judge that he wanted his client's trial moved from New York City because jurors might be prejudiced by the Sept. 11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. A14","2228":"If the address did not have the drama of Mr. Bush's Sept. 20 speech in the same House chamber, when an untried president vowed to unleash the nation's military might against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, it was still a marked change from the first major speech he made as president to Congress only 11 months ago.","2229":"The other widow was Renae Chapman, wife of Sgt. First Class Nathan R. Chapman of the Army's Special Forces. Sergeant Chapman was killed on Jan. 4 when his group was ambushed in Paktia province, near the border with Pakistan, as they tried to stitch together a local militia to hunt for Osama bin Laden and his Taliban ally, Mullah Muhammad Omar.","2230":"Earlier, Ms. Horan had worked at the F.B.I.'s Washington office heading counterterrorism investigations. She was placed in charge of the initial investigation into the East Africa embassy bombings in 1998, an inquiry that led to the conviction of several Al Qaeda followers of Osama bin Laden.","2231":"But there were subjects Mr. Bush avoided. He never uttered the name Osama bin Laden, who has eluded capture and remains the subject of an intense manhunt but is also a symbol of what remains incomplete in Mr. Bush's campaign in Afghanistan.","2232":"At the same time, the Afghan conflict seems to have confirmed Osama bin Laden as a folk hero.","2233":"This shift toward an elaboration on national character may help explain a major omission in the president's war talk: his failure to make any mention of Osama bin Laden, who planned the Sept. 11 attack but has yet to be captured. In many minds, the justification of the United States attacks on Afghanistan was retaliatory, exemplified by the president's vow to track down Mr. bin Laden. This is what Americans want, the yardstick they have identified for victory.","2235":"The apparent success of the Afghan campaign should not encourage Mr. Bush to overreach. As much of the world recognized, the attacks of Sept. 11 left the United States no choice but to defend itself, as it has done by dismantling the Taliban in Afghanistan and going after Osama bin Laden and his followers. There may well be circumstances that call for military action elsewhere in the months ahead, perhaps even pre-emptive strikes. Sept. 11, however, does not give Mr. Bush an unlimited hunting license. As a number of his predecessors learned to their and the nation's dismay, turning too quickly or too frequently to the use of force can cost a president support at home and damage American interests and alliances abroad.","2236":"President Bush's focus on the evildoers who must be sought (front page, Jan. 30) omits an important question that we have yet to engage: What United States policies, practices and institutions sustain the climate in which even criminals like Osama bin Laden find support and new recruits to replace those whom we are able to neutralize?","2237":"Also sought for questioning is a retired air force and intelligence officer named Khalid Khawaja, who had close ties with Sheik Gilani and Osama bin Laden, according to news media reports.","2238":"Most of the Sept. 11 hijackers and Osama bin Laden are from one particular country. It is insulting to this American that we have to depend on states like Saudi Arabia. We can do all kinds of things differently. This is war. Let us act as if we are in one.","2239":"So what is the lesson of this? Is it that while pretending to take the high road, we have actually slaughtered more people than Osama bin Laden has? Or that military responses are unjustifiable because huge numbers of innocents inevitably are killed?","2240":"Saudi Arabia's normally reticent leaders have made an unusual effort in recent days to air their views about the United States and its role in the Middle East. The openness itself is welcome and some of the comments have been heartening, including the desire to strengthen the friendship between Riyadh and Washington. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia's rulers remain reluctant to reckon with deformities in their own society that fuel the violent Islamic fundamentalism of Osama bin Laden and his followers.","2241":"In her decision, Judge Scheindlin also barred the government from introducing computer-generated photographs of Osama bin Laden found in Mr. Awadallah's apartment.","2242":"Mr. Berezovsky said his evidence 'is no less than the evidence the United States had that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the World Trade Center attack.'","2243":"'We are here to launch a round of exercises and training designed to enhance the capabilities of both of our armed forces and to help the armed forces of the Philippines hone their skills to eliminate the Abu Sayyaf scourge,' the acting American ambassador, Robert Fitts, said at the opening ceremony, referring to a Muslim separatist terrorist group that has been linked to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2244":"In a television interview Osama bin Laden gave in late October, he said the anthrax attacks last fall were 'a punishment from God' and hinted in vague language at having a hand in the Sept. 11 attacks.","2245":"Osama bin Laden, in an interview last fall that was brought to light only last night, said the anthrax attacks were 'a punishment from God' and, in vague language, seemed to hint at having a hand in them. A10","2247":"THE BUSH AGENDA -- In his State of the Union address, President Bush broadened his theme of national defense beyond antiterrorism. He pinpointed Iran, Iraq and North Korea, which are either known or believed to be developing biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, saying, 'states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil.' Terrorism remains a looming threat, he said, with Al Qaeda's trainees numbering tens of thousands, and with plans of American water supply systems and nuclear power plants among the documents unearthed in Afghanistan. He did not, however, mention two prominent fugitives: Osama bin Laden or Mullah Muhammad Omar.","2248":"SOLO, Indonesia, Jan. 31\u2014 Among the nearly 2,000 students crammed into Al Mukmin boarding school, Osama bin Laden is a hero. His photo, in full color and poster size, is plastered on the walls of the dormitories much as rock stars decorate teenagers' bedrooms in America. His face peers out from the inside of locker doors and appears on T-shirts worn under the preppy blazers of senior prefects.","2249":"Since Sept. 11, Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, the de facto Saudi ruler, has blamed criticism of the kingdom on Western media. The prince finally launched a counteroffensive, receiving reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post at one of his residential palaces. He called the U.S. a friend, branded its policy toward Palestinians inhumane and called Saudi-born Osama bin Laden a 'deviant.' He sent regards to President Bush and the American people, and then departed for a ceremonial sword dance. Elaine Sciolino","2250":"The negative reaction of the Arab and Muslim communities was enough to convince the screenwriter, Ed Zuckerman, to take his name out of the credits (he is listed as Ned Curren). 'It didn't seem prudent,' said Mr. Zuckerman, who has not publicly acknowledged his work on the film until now. The Sept. 11 attacks would also affect his work: he is an executive producer of the CBS drama series about the C.I.A., 'The Agency,' which pulled, shuffled and edited several episodes because of references to Osama bin Laden and anthrax.","2251":"My photographer and I were the only ones the Kenyan authorities put through emigration formalities. A television producer later suggested that I had been racially profiled. After all, she asked, who's the most likely threat: the Somali toting home a 100-pound bag of Kenyan rice, or the white American with the satellite phone who might call in an airstrike from the offshore fleet trying to make sure that Osama bin Laden doesn't slip into Somalia?","2252":"Efforts by the University of South Florida to protect his rights are extraordinary. Mr. Al-Arian spent almost two and a half years on paid leave because of a federal investigation in the mid-1990's into allegations that he operated a terrorist front. He helped bring to Tampa the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and he has been questioned about his relationship with a man who helped arrange ABC News's interview with Osama bin Laden three years ago.","2253":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 3\u2014 A month after United States officials expressed confidence that they had cornered Osama bin Laden in the mountains of Tora Bora, they now acknowledge that they have lost track of the terrorist leader and are increasingly frustrated over the virtual absence of intelligence on his whereabouts.","2254":"Mr. Ivanov complained about what he called double standards from the West for failing to condemn extremists in the Russian province of Chechnya with the same vigor as it has condemned Osama bin Laden.","2255":"LONDON\u2014 They told us it would be a long, ugly struggle, and so it is. America's war against terror has entered its second phase, a phase characterized by the storm over the status and human rights of the prisoners held at Camp X-Ray and by the frustrating failure of the United States to find Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar. Additionally, if America now attacks other countries suspected of harboring terrorists it will almost certainly do so alone. In spite of the military successes, America finds itself facing a broader ideological adversary that may turn out to be as hard to defeat as militant Islam: anti-Americanism, which is presently becoming more evident everywhere.","2256":"U.S. officials acknowledge they have lost track of Osama bin Laden, who was last traced to eastern Afghanistan in early December. PAGE A8","2257":"A month after they thought Osama bin Laden was cornered, United States officials acknowledge that they have lost track of him and are frustrated over a lack of intelligence about his whereabouts. A8","2258":"A similar chill is settling over world politics. Australia's government uses the threat of terrorism to justify incarcerating Afghan refugees in a desert compound. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have leveraged their provision of bases and intelligence into a carte blanche for domestic repression. Egypt, which for many years has used detention without trial, military courts and torture to keep control of militants, now demands an even freer hand. Sudan, which was under attack from a coalition of liberals and black churches determined to end slavery and stop Khartoum's war against the south, is now accepted as an ally against Osama bin Laden. And President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has decided that his longtime political opponents are really 'terrorists.'","2259":"Over the years, the hajj has been marred by fire, disease, demonstrations, stampedes and riots. Osama bin Laden and others who support him have said they were offended by the presence of American 'infidel' troops in Saudi Arabia because it is home to the holiest Muslim sites.","2260":"Turkish intelligence authorities foiled the scheme, and 18 people were later convicted. But the conspiracy is being looked at again because of the discovery of evidence linking Osama bin Laden to the German-based group, which is led by a renegade Turkish preacher, Metin Kaplan. Mr. Kaplan advocates the killing of all nonbelievers and is bent in particular on the destruction of Turkey's secular government.","2261":"Since you've all told me privately that this is your position, why not make it public and get the benefit? This is how to bury Osama bin Laden and define for the world who the Arabs really are. If you can't take that risk, why should I?","2262":"Mr. Bush also used the event to chide newspapers and television for dwelling on the elusiveness of Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader.","2263":"The 10 charges accuse Mr. Lindh of training to fight with Osama bin Laden's terror network and then conspiring with the Taliban to kill Americans in Afghanistan.","2264":"Then, in an hourlong interview, he likened his effort to the search for Osama bin Laden and his deputies in Afghanistan.","2265":"Anti-American sentiment abounded even as the number of delegates from the United States this year, the forum's second, climbed to several hundred from a dozen last year. One popular T-shirt among fringe groups compared Osama bin Laden to Ernesto 'Che' Guevara and Jesus. No American flags were burned, though, apparently out of respect for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.","2266":"Osama bin Laden was held up as a role model, a man who had given up his wealth and comfortable life in Saudi Arabia to live in poverty and fight in Afghanistan, Mr. Sobri, a roadside food vendor, said today. His wife tended to their 6-month-old son in a stroller.","2267":"In Afghanistan, Mr. Tenet said, the United States had recovered documents that showed that Osama bin Laden was pursuing a sophisticated biological weapons research program. He said the group was also trying to acquire dangerous chemical agents and toxins, as well as a weapon that would disperse radioactive materials.","2268":"'First of all, Osama bin Laden is absolutely justified in the terror he has caused on 9-11,' Mr. Bishop wrote. 'He has brought a mighty nation to its knees! God blesses him and the others who helped make September 11th happen.'","2269":"In Afghanistan, Mr. Tenet said, the United States had recovered documents that showed that Osama bin Laden was pursuing a sophisticated biological weapons research program. He said the group was also trying to acquire dangerous chemical agents and toxins, as well as a weapon that would disperse radioactive materials.","2271":"As for matters within Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai was asked when he might ask American forces to leave his country and abandon their quest for Osama bin Laden. His answer suggested that he did not want that moment to come any time soon.","2272":"After the attacks, he held secret discussions with Pakistani officials about the possibility of handing over Osama bin Laden to the Americans, officials in Pakistan have said. Mullah Muttawakil is believed to have viewed Mr. bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan as an obstacle to gaining international acceptance for the Taliban, according to a person close to the Taliban leadership who knows Mullah Muttawakil well.","2273":"When the sergeant and his unit arrived by helicopter on Jan. 3, they were the first Americans deployed here since the beginning of ground operations in October. They came mainly to pursue reports that two of their most wanted quarries -- Osama bin Laden and Jalaluddin Haqqani, the Taliban's commander in the southern provinces -- might be holed up in mountains near town.","2275":"So, to begin with, maybe -- just maybe -- there is no Jewish conspiracy against Muslims or Saudi Arabia at work here. Maybe, just maybe, many Americans are upset because 15 Saudis took part in the Sept. 11 attacks, private Saudi charities financed Osama bin Laden and hundreds of Saudis fought with Al Qaeda against America in Afghanistan. And these hard facts have hardened U.S. opinion against them.","2276":"As Salman Rushdie says, you don't have to travel far to find anti-Americanism (Op-Ed, Feb. 4). Teaching at a Canadian university, I have been astounded by some students who say the Al Qaeda attacks, inside or outside the United States, were justified because only Americans were targeted. Remaking Osama bin Laden in their own anti-American image, they insist he has no quarrel with Canada or others, just the United States.","2277":"TALIBAN AND AL QAEDA -- The Taliban's foreign minister, Mullah Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, surrendered to Afghanistan's interim government and was handed over to U.S. forces in Kandahar, becoming the highest ranking member of the regime in custody. A rare moderate, he had apparently chafed at how Osama bin Laden obstructed international acceptance of the Taliban, and after Sept. 11 reportedly held secret discussions with Pakistani officials about handing him over to the Americans. The terms of his surrender were not clear.","2278":"Nonetheless, and despite a disastrous street battle in 1993 that unraveled its successful effort to feed Somalia, the United States has taken a new interest in the country since Sept. 11, believing that it may become Osama bin Laden's hiding place, a refuge for experienced terrorists and a breeding ground for new ones.","2279":"Military and intelligence officials said the drone had loitered over the Zawar Kili area, in Paktia Province, for several hours and had spotted a group of men near a truck at a camp believed to have been used by Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","2280":"For example, Iran and Syria were both sharply critical of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and the attacks of Sept. 11. Nevertheless, they are both enemies of Western values and interests. Both have energetically backed terrorism: the former has just been caught out dispatching arms to foment violence against Israel. Iran is also making strides toward developing long-range missiles that could be armed with nuclear warheads.","2281":"Mr. Miller's pairing with Ms. Walters, executives said, would help it do that and would be especially helpful in closing the divide between 'World News Tonight' and 'Nightline' on one side and the news magazine programs on the other. Mr. Miller -- one of only a handful of correspondents to have interviewed Osama bin Laden -- is more likely than past anchors to produce '20/20' segments on subjects appealing to Mr. Jennings and his producer, Paul Slavin.","2282":"In fact, Somalia has not bothered us since we stopped bothering it. Sudan evicted Osama bin Laden not because of American nation-building but because of our threats. Afghanistan really became a threat to us only after the Taliban ended two decades of chaos there and welcomed Osama bin Laden. Our enemy is not chaos, but states that support terrorism.","2283":"The judge dismissed a charge that the Jordanian-American, Raed Hijazi, belonged to an illegal organization -- identified in court documents as Al Qaeda -- saying there was no evidence that Osama bin Laden's organization had a formal structure or membership in Jordan.","2284":"The lawyer for a suspected aide to Osama bin Laden, citing a survey suggesting that the New York City jury pool has been tainted by the Sept. 11 attack, formally asked yesterday that the man's trial in a jailhouse assault be moved.","2285":"More recently, in the years of headlong Islamic jihad before the Sept. 11 attacks, fervent Muslims inspired by the Taliban and Osama bin Laden plotted their various holy wars in the recesses of Karachi's endless warrens of concrete block.","2286":"For years, the Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Laden has vowed to purge the kingdom of the 'infidel' American military presence from the country of the two holy shrines. Those threats have made American military commanders particularly uneasy about discussing religious services for their troops.","2287":"Among other things, Mr. Khawaja, a former air force officer, is said by Pakistani officials to have once served as a pilot for Osama bin Laden.","2288":"On a recent day at Emory University here, for example, students in Suzanne Werner's introductory course in international politics talked about the nature of power and why groups like the Taliban might resort to force. In Kenneth Stein's freshmen seminar on the Middle East, students plunged into the roots of religious fundamentalism and why Osama bin Laden felt threatened. In J. Larry Taulbee's seminar, 'Governing the Use of Force,' students debated whether American bombing in Afghanistan was justified.","2289":"There had been some speculation that the tall man in the group was Osama bin Laden, but Pentagon officials said they had no evidence of that.","2290":"A senior official of Afghanistan's interim government, Yunus Qanooni, said elements in Pakistan's intelligence service had helped Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammad Omar evade capture. A19","2291":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 12\u2014 A senior official of Afghanistan's interim government, in comments published today, accused elements in Pakistan's intelligence service of helping Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammad Omar evade capture.","2292":"The Pakistani intelligence agents detained in the case were retired officials who had close ties with members of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan during the 1980's, including Osama bin Laden.","2293":"Mr. Ashcroft described the 17 men, most of them Yemenis, as 'individuals who may be associated with Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network.' Other law enforcement officials said they suspected that some were Qaeda members, although they did not know how many.","2294":"Mr. Zubaydah has been one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants since the late 1990's, and American intelligence agencies believe that he was at Mr. bin Laden's side in Afghanistan in the first weeks after Sept. 11. His whereabouts today are unknown, although Bush administration officials say there is fragmentary evidence that he escaped to Pakistan.","2295":"It's not that poor people become terrorists. The hijackers on 9/11 were mostly from middle-class homes. But poverty, alienation and frustration nurture guerrilla groups that are often led by those from privileged backgrounds (Mao, the son of a moderately prosperous landowner who led a peasant revolution, is an example; so is Osama bin Laden).","2296":"Mr. Ashcroft described the 17 men as 'individuals who may be associated with Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network.' Other law enforcement officials said they suspected that some were Al Qaeda members.","2297":"Canadian hockey fans do not talk about Osama bin Laden as they chant and march -- and occasionally stagger -- across Temple Street.","2298":"In his world view, a vast Jewish conspiracy is behind every event, including the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Like his old friend and student Osama bin Laden, he has divided the world into good Muslims and everybody else, saying that supporters of the American war in Afghanistan are infidels.","2299":"An article on Dec. 29 about a news conference at which President Bush spoke in Crawford, Tex., added a word erroneously to his reply on his watching of a broadcast videotape of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Bush said, 'I didn't watch it all'; he did not say 'at all.' The error was pointed out in a letter dated Dec. 29 from a reader who noticed a discrepancy with the published excerpts; the letter was misrouted at The Times.","2300":"The government has said it seized incriminating evidence in those searches, including a box cutter and a photograph of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Awadallah was later brought to New York, and after testifying twice before a federal grand jury, he was charged with two counts of perjury.","2301":"American government officials said one of the people in the group was tall and was being treated with deference by those around him. That gave rise to speculation that the attack might have been directed at Osama bin Laden, who is 6-feet-4.","2302":"But as journalists on the ground in Afghanistan became able to make their way along the rough and dangerous roads in recent weeks, a much more complex and disturbing picture began emerging. Indeed, it often seemed that there were two different wars being reported: the neat, efficient one of the Pentagon briefings and the messier one in the field, where there were civilian casualties, botched raids and -- lest it be forgotten -- the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar and the Al Qaeda leadership.","2303":"But you don't have to look far below the glittering surface of that decade to discover that history was, in fact, still in motion. It is not just that Osama bin Laden and his ilk were busy hatching their plots in the caves of Afghanistan. The global economy was always much shakier than most people imagined. One of the most severe economic crises since World War II occurred in 1998, a crisis of confidence that swept through the developing world and even threatened to spread to the United States.","2305":"But Mr. Awadallah charges that he was coerced into speaking to the authorities and into allowing them to search his apartment and two cars. Prosecutors say they found incriminating evidence, including a box cutter and a photograph of Osama bin Laden, after finding Mr. Awadallah's name written on a piece of paper in a car rented by one of the suspected hijackers.","2306":"Officials said available evidence suggested they had played no role in the Sept. 11 attacks or Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network, and the immigration cases against some of them were resolved as long as four months ago.","2307":"Canada has been a concern to American policy makers since a Montreal-based Algerian named Ahmed Ressam, suspected of being a follower of Osama bin Laden, tried to enter Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada in late 1999. He had 130 pounds of explosives in his car, apparently to bomb the Los Angeles airport during millennium celebrations.","2308":"As part of the effort to counter the pronouncements of the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and their supporters, the State Department has already hired a former advertising executive to run its public diplomacy office, and the White House has created a public information 'war room' to coordinate the administration's daily message domestically and abroad.","2309":"The pressures have left many young people confused and restless, and admiring of the radical defiance of the Saudi-born Osama bin Laden. However, there appears to be little appetite for the terrorism and violence advocated by bin Laden. Rather, young men are rebelling in other ways: by luring police officers into 120 mile-an-hour chases on the freeways, tossing firecrackers into crowds at soccer matches, even disguising themselves as women to infiltrate women-only spaces. On the night of the incident in Dammam, two young men were killed during a high-speed joy ride when their Toyota Camry hit a lamppost.","2310":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19\u2014 The families of seven victims of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center filed a class-action lawsuit today against Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as Iran and Iraq.","2311":"The war against global terrorism is fought not just in the military arena but also in the international exchange of news and information. Osama bin Laden and his allies are gifted propagandists who have spread a welter of malicious misinformation throughout the Muslim world. The White House understandably would like to knock down these falsehoods and get its own message out quickly and efficiently to foreign audiences. But this must be done in a sensible, sophisticated and honorable way rather than the duplicitous fashion the Pentagon has in mind.","2312":"BURBANK, Calif., Feb. 19\u2014 Vice President Dick Cheney took America's war on terror to late-night television today, mixing jokes about his diet and elusive work habits with a renewed vow to hunt down Osama bin Laden.","2313":"The families of seven victims of the attack on the World Trade Center filed a class-action lawsuit against Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as Iran and Iraq. A11","2314":"American officials have publicly pledged not to walk away from Afghanistan once the hunt for Osama bin Laden is over, and they do not want the country once again to become a breeding pool for terrorists.","2315":"She said there was no proof of a long-term shift in public opinion, adding that if Osama bin Laden was captured, brought to the United States and found to be mentally retarded, public opinion would not regard him as ineligible to be executed.","2316":"The police said that one of the men arrested here was believed to have ties to seven Tunisians now standing trial in Milan, who are under investigation for planning to attack the United States Embassy last January. The police have accused these men, who are charged with arms trafficking and falsifying documents, of links to Osama bin Laden.","2317":"More than 600 American soldiers are in the Philippines to train and advise the Philippine military in fighting an Islamic group, Abu Sayyaf, that has been linked to Osama bin Laden. Abu Sayyaf, which operates on Basilan and other nearby islands, is holding two American missionaries hostage.","2318":"Last night several items related to Osama bin Laden were listed on the site.","2319":"The F.B.I.'s Web site now has him at the top of that list, alongside Osama bin Laden. The United States is offering $2 million for information leading to his conviction.","2320":"By contrast, the Deobandi madrassas of Pakistan became training grounds for holy war and many of the Taliban leaders. Masood Azhar, Deobandi leader of the Pakistan-based Army of Muhammad, is believed to have been behind terrorist attacks on India, and the Taliban, as the Deobandi harborers of Osama bin Laden, posed a mortal threat to the United States.","2321":"I was told this was not the true feeling here. I was told the hijackers were actually educated in America. I was told they were sent by Mossad or the C.I.A. I was told in one session that the Jews control the U.S. government and that was the real problem, a statement that prompted me to walk out. I was told the hijackers were responding to Arab anger over blind U.S. support for Israel's brutality to Palestinians. If that was the case, I asked, why did Osama bin Laden say that what motivated him was a desire to drive the U.S. out of Arabia and topple the corrupt Saudi ruling family? I got no good answers.","2322":"Insurers also look at the nature of the business to be insured, said Mr. Minor, who is in charge of political risk coverage at Aon. A chemical plant, he said, is a riskier proposition than a cannery; joint ventures with local partners are more likely to go wrong than businesses in which the foreign owner has more control; and high-technology companies are less likely to become targets for government takeover than some other businesses because their success depends upon highly skilled managers. These days, as the United States pursues Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Yemen, Sudan and other Islamic nations top the insurers' list of risky places to do business.","2323":"They would rather make troops available as props in gung-ho videos than available to explain how the commanders let Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda leaders escape or targeted the wrong villages. Mr. Bruckheimer said his program would not usurp reporters' access. 'Reporters are after breaking news,' he said. 'We're doing profiles.' He said the Pentagon would check the show before it aired, as it did with 'Black Hawk Down': 'It's not censorship, but we do have a conversation.'","2324":"In his review of my book 'Warrior Politics' (Feb. 3), Donald Kagan suggests that I identify with fatalists like Chamberlain rather than with idealists like Churchill and Reagan, even as he admits that Churchill is my 'exemplary statesman.' In fact, in the book I write that 'an ordinary man who values freedom will often recognize the truth. Ronald Reagan was such a man.' I go on to say that 'Churchill and Reagan represented strategic and moral decisiveness against considerable odds.' I devote an entire chapter to a celebration of Churchill's hardheaded morality. In 'Warrior Politics,' completed months before Sept. 11, I use Churchill's support for a moral intervention in Sudan in the 1890's to justify the need for us to hunt down Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.","2325":"First there was 911 and 9/11, used to signify not just the date, but everything that happened on it and afterward. There were terms like ground zero, evildoers, Al Qaeda and Taliban. Then there was post-Taliban and anti-Taliban and Sept. 10 'as an adjective meaning oblivious to danger or na\u00efve,' Professor Glowka said. 'I nearly drove off the road when I heard Rush Limbaugh reading an article someone had passed him about the Osamaniacs,' he said. The word was being used for women infatuated with Osama bin Laden. The professor said he grabbed a tissue and scribbled Osamaniacs on it. Later, he said, he happened upon a related term, Osamaphiles.","2326":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 23\u2014 After weeks of uncertainty over the fate of Osama bin Laden, senior administration officials now say they have fresh indications that he survived the bombing assault on Tora Bora and other Afghan mountain regions, and that he is probably still in the remote terrain that straddles the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.","2327":"Fresh evidence suggests that Osama bin Laden survived bombing in Tora Bora and is probably hiding in mountains near Pakistan, officials said. 1","2328":"Saudi posturing serves three purposes: (1) to counter U.S. repugnance at financial support of hate-America mosques that resulted in the Sept. 11 attacks by 15 Saudis, (2) to pretend that the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is the source of the Arab world's discontents, a pretense also adopted by Osama bin Laden, and (3) to prepare the ground for a denial of our Saudi bases to support an attack on Saddam Hussein's germ factories.","2329":"Officials said today that the police had not found a definitive link between the suspects and Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network.","2330":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 25\u2014 An analysis of suspected radioactive substances seized in Afghanistan has found nothing to prove that Osama bin Laden reached his decade-long goal of acquiring nuclear materials for a bomb, administration officials say.","2331":"An analysis of suspected radioactive substances seized in Afghanistan found nothing that would prove Osama bin Laden had acquired nuclear materials for a bomb. A1","2332":"The list demonstrates that the administration has broadened its sights to include terrorists not linked to Osama bin Laden or to attacks on the United States. As Mr. O'Neill put it: 'Our crackdown on terrorists is blind to nationality and origin. It's a net being cast on all terrorist parasites that threaten our allies and our national security.'","2333":"The assault trial of a man suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden should not be moved out of New York City because of the Sept. 11 terror attack, federal prosecutors have told a judge. The defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is accused of attacking a guard in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in November 2000 while awaiting trial on terrorism conspiracy charges. The guard was stabbed in the eye with a comb made into a knife. Mr. Salim has pleaded not guilty to all charges. In their court papers, filed Monday, prosecutors rejected claims that Mr. Salim could not receive a fair trial in New York. The assault case, they wrote, 'has nothing to do with terrorism in general or the World Trade Center attack in particular.' Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","2334":"The aim of the training mission, which has not yet been approved by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, would be to prepare Georgian troops for combatting foreign fighters that have been operating in a mountainous region of the country and could have links to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network.","2335":"This is how the Soviet school sees it: The ruling al-Saud brothers are like the old Soviet Politburo; the 50,000 al-Saud princes and relatives are the equivalent of the Communist Party. Wahhabism, the puritanical Saudi Arabian brand of Islam, is used by the al-Sauds to unite the 40 fractious tribes of the Arabian Peninsula, just as Communism was used by Lenin to unite the 100 fractious nationalities of Russia and its neighboring republics. Osama bin Laden is just the evil version of Andrei Sakharov -- the insider who steps outside the system to declare that the king has no clothes. Sakharov was exiled to Gorky for that and bin Laden to Kabul. And ultimately, both systems went into decline after unhappy encounters where? In Afghanistan.","2336":"Top Russian officials have even suggested -- while admitting they have no proof -- that Osama bin Laden could find refuge in Pankisi Gorge. A Chechen rebel commander, Ruslan Gelayev, has set up training camps for fighters who use the gorge as a rear area for rest, training and arms supply, Russian officials said. Western officials say some criminals operate from the gorge, in league with corrupt Georgian politicians.","2337":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 27\u2014 The United States is trying indirectly to obtain samples of DNA from relatives of Osama bin Laden for possible future use in identifying his remains, American officials said today.","2338":"'I have a right to leave a foul message,' he said, adding that the statute was so absurd that if he called up Osama bin Laden, used a vulgarity and told him 'I wish he dies of cancer, here in New York I could be arrested.'","2339":"'Clearly, we've got to find Muhammad Omar, we've got to find Osama bin Laden, and we've got to find other key leaders of the Al Qaeda network, or we will have failed,' Mr. Daschle said. At the same time, referring to expansion of the campaign against terror, he added: 'Before we make commitments in resources, I think we need to have a clearer understanding of what the direction will be.'","2340":"The Pentagon has long viewed Yemen as a center of support for Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader. His father was born there. Yemen was also the site of the terrorist attack on the destroyer Cole, which killed 17 American sailors in October 2000.","2341":"President Bush brushed off criticism from the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, that the United States war on terrorism will have failed if Osama bin Laden is not found. A11","2342":"It is understandable that the man in the street might confuse the success of this difficult military and diplomatic action with the capture of Osama bin Laden and others, but we should expect more from our elected officials. Mr. Daschle's behavior undermines this country's declared goal of defeating Al Qaeda and terrorism, regardless of their leaders.","2343":"Administration officials have reported in recent days that an analysis of suspected radioactive substances seized from Al Qaeda compounds in Afghanistan found nothing to show that Osama bin Laden and his followers had reached their decade-long goal of acquiring nuclear materials for a bomb.","2344":"DES MOINES, March 1\u2014 President Bush brushed off criticism today from Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, who has said that the United States will have failed in its war on terror if Osama bin Laden is not found.","2345":"American popular culture, American film, American pop music, American fast food and American television manage to inspire both love and hate, as if the two passions were inseparable parts of a single whole, evoking the video image last fall of Osama bin Laden wearing what appeared to be a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch. So while the Taliban tried to quash the cultural influences of the West -- hanging televisions from trees like electronic corpses -- Afghan women were risking their lives by secretly going to Western-style beauty parlors.","2346":"In the last two months, American warplanes and commandos have staged many raids against suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda compounds, but senior American military officials said the offensive today was more akin to the broad campaign late last year in Tora Bora, where heavy bombing and ground operations over several weeks routed hard-core Qaeda warriors from a last remaining stronghold, but apparently did not kill or capture Osama bin Laden.","2347":"Planning for the Gardez offensive has been under way for weeks amid reports that Al Qaeda fighters have been regrouping in the region. The goal is not just to kill remnants of the Qaeda force but to capture some. Still, there is no hard intelligence that indicates that Osama bin Laden or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, is in the area.","2348":"Notably, some detainees have said they had heard that hijackers were being trained in an Afghan camp before the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, officials said. Several have also said they saw Osama bin Laden after Sept. 11, and suggested to interrogators that Mr. bin Laden quickly shifted his headquarters to the mountainous region around Tora Bora after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.","2349":"Even more than the scourge of terror, the Palestinian plight has seized the conscience of the kingdom. Television is dominated by one-sided images of the Palestinians -- and none of Israelis -- as victims of violence. Sympathy for the cause of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist, runs high, Saudi officials and academics say, not because Saudis like terrorism, but because he has latched onto the Palestinian cause.","2351":"AL QAEDA: The U.S. government is quietly using intermediaries to obtain DNA samples from the bin Laden family. Intelligence analysts believe Osama bin Laden remains alive, but a fatal U.S. attack of Feb. 4 on three men near Khost, Afghanistan, raised interest in DNA testing to be certain none of the three was Mr. bin Laden.","2352":"'I'm looking for a dangerous man,' Sardono prompted the dancer to roar. 'They say Osama bin Laden is here.' The cowboy then receives a call on his mobile phone, to which Sardono encourages the dancer to yell again: 'Afghanistan, finished. Philippines. O.K., Philippines, we'll go there.' This is a reference to the Philippine government agreeing to accept American troops on its territory to eliminate a local terrorist group.","2353":"During the December battle at Tora Bora, the American military relied heavily on the combination of its Afghan allies and small teams of Special Operations forces to prevent its foe from escaping. The strategy avoided American casualties but hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters, possibly including Osama bin Laden, got away.","2354":"Today, Mr. Daschle again expressed reservations about these plans. He said the first phase of the war was not yet complete, noting that Osama bin Laden, whose Al Qaeda network is considered responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, was still at large.","2355":"In conversations beside the town's bazaar, residents of Zormat did not recall seeing any of the highest echelon of Taliban and Qaeda leaders, or at least they were unwilling to say they had witnessed them. This appeared to leave the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, as much a mystery as ever. Capturing or killing these two was among America's highest priorities when the bombing began on Oct. 7.","2356":"A major concern for American commanders has been that Taliban and Qaeda units might still have some of the hundreds of American-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles that turned Afghanistan into a graveyard for Soviet aircraft during the Muslim guerrilla struggle of the 1980's, when Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, learned battlefield skills.","2357":"Later, Mr. Bush sounded unconcerned about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, and obliquely hinted that he was already dead. 'I haven't heard from him since September-December the 11th,' he said. 'He's been awfully quiet. I don't know why. But I know he's on the run, if he's running at all.'","2358":"The main reason America sent troops to Afghanistan was to destroy Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. With thousands of Qaeda fighters still at large, and top leaders like Osama bin Laden unaccounted for, military operations must go on, and experience shows that American ground forces will need to play a central role.","2359":"American officials said the new communications traffic was a serious concern because they feared that Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network, could use its sophisticated Internet ability to launch new terror attacks against the United States.","2360":"The switch made for a stark contrast with the battle three months ago in the Tora Bora mountains in eastern Afghanistan, when American Special Forces directing Afghan fighters in a frustrated hunt for Osama bin Laden and other top Qaeda and Taliban leaders played only a limited role, leaving much of the assault to aerial bombardment.","2361":"Tourism nose-dived in 1998 after it was disclosed that one of the men involved in the terrorist bombing of the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam was from Pemba, the smaller of the two main islands that make up Zanzibar. Khalfan Khamis Muhammad, an operative working for Osama bin Laden, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for helping to make the explosives used to attack the embassy on Aug. 7, 1998.","2362":"Though American officials sought to play down expectations, senior Afghan officials have begun to hint that the real prize in the combat now unfolding at heights of up to 10,000 feet could include capturing or killing of some of the highest-ranking leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, perhaps even Osama bin Laden.","2363":"The French police were questioning the wife of a man accused of plotting to blow up the American Embassy in Paris and suspected of having links with Osama bin Laden.","2364":"In the last few days the governor, an American citizen who only recently returned to his native country after a decade in Los Angeles, has been strongly suggesting that Osama bin Laden may be present in the Paktia mountains, making a last stand.","2365":"Both President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have said that our troops are having trouble finding Osama bin Laden, but that we're gonna get him!","2366":"In contrast, Indonesia 'is a place of interest,' the official said. But asked about widely rumored discussions under way with the government of President Megawati Sukarnoputri on deeper American involvement in Indonesia, where anti-American sentiment is running strong, the official refused to comment, and would not discuss the administration's evaluation of whether Al Qaeda is using the country, where sympathy to Osama bin Laden is keen in some areas.","2367":"'There's no doubt in my mind that much of our presence is destabilizing to the government,' said one senior military officer. 'The best thing we can do is to make a measured decrease in our presence. The dilemma we face is that if we leave right now, it looks like we're caving to Osama bin Laden's demands.'","2368":"Should we inscribe the name of Osama bin Laden in the ever-lengthening book of famous plagiarists? In two videotapes broadcast after Sept. 11, the terrorist is shown reciting a poem that most viewers assumed he wrote himself. In one tape, he chants it to his dinner guests in a safe house; in the other, his most recent public address, he weaves the poem into a tearful homage to the 19 hijackers. The lines, however, were not bin Laden's. A few weeks after the second videotape was shown in December, a Jordanian who said he was the cousin of the actual poet published a small article in the London-based newspaper Al Hayat accusing bin Laden of plagiarism.","2369":"This is dangerous. The notion is taking hold -- it started with Osama bin Laden, was refined by Palestinian suicide bombers and is cheered on by Hezbollah, Iran and other radicals -- that with a combination of demographics (a baby boom) and terrorism, the Arabs can actually destroy Israel. Some radicals even fantasize that they can undermine America.","2371":"Late last summer, Indonesia's newly elected vice president, Hamzah Haz, welcomed a string of guests into his official residence, only a short walk from the sprawling American Embassy compound in downtown Jakarta. Among the academics and politicos he greeted was a 40-year-old Muslim cleric named Jaffar Umar Thalib. A photograph in a local newspaper the next day showed him and the vice president locked in a warm embrace. Outside Indonesia, however, this visit by Jaffar -- who was, even then, arguably the most feared Islamic militant in the most populous Muslim nation on earth and who would soon be mentioned in the same breath as Osama bin Laden -- went largely unreported.","2372":"The authorities in Uzbekistan have essentially untied the militia's hands. If militiamen kill citizens, they can simply fill out documents claiming the victim was a terrorist, or even a follower of Osama bin Laden. No civilian has any ability to question this characterization.","2373":"What is Mr. Philbin, a Defense Department spokesman, so eagerly awaiting? Toilet paper. Two hundred rolls of it, each sheet imprinted with Osama bin Laden's face and the all-too-easy pun, 'Wipe Out Terrorism.'","2374":"TUNIS\u2014 Since Sept. 11, the world has come to know more about the educational systems prevalent today in Muslim countries and their role in promoting hostility toward the West. The educational system of Osama bin Laden's native Saudi Arabia is being criticized in the West, particularly in the United States. The Indian government last December announced an effort to reform the Muslim religious schools known as madrasas, though this is perhaps a mixed blessing given that the same government is using the schools to promote Hinduism as part of its nationalist program. Across the border in Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf is pursuing reform of his country's educational system -- a project that will be watched by other Muslim nations. Education was a major subject of discussion in Mr. Musharraf's meeting with President Bush last month. This was itself something rather new.","2375":"'I think this is a country of followers,' said Sgt. Justin Adamson, 22, of Oregon, Ohio. 'Osama bin Laden comes along with money, so they follow him. So who are they going to follow next? If they followed the Taliban, they'll follow anyone.'","2376":"A federal judge refused yesterday to move the assault trial of a man suspected of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden out of Manhattan, saying he could receive a fair trial in New York.","2377":"The crackdown was the first since Sept. 11 to result from a joint effort by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Administration officials said it was a sign of increasing cooperation with the kingdom, which was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the terrorist attacks and which the United States feels has been slow to take action against suspected supporters of Osama bin Laden and other terrorist organizations.","2378":"There is no way of knowing how many Afghans listen, but the Pentagon contends that Commando Solo has undermined faith in Mullah Muhammad Omar and Osama bin Laden, and won support for the American-backed interim government and its chairman, Hamid Karzai.","2379":"The fight now is between three different views: The first is Osama bin Laden's. His view is that there is no place for a Jewish state, or other 'infidels,' particularly Americans, in the Muslim world.","2380":"Asked why he so rarely talked these days about Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, he suggested that even if Mr. bin Laden is alive, he had been 'marginalized.' The president called Mr. bin Laden 'the ultimate parasite.'","2382":"'If I were Osama bin Laden, I'd be on lookout for an alienated, vulnerable character like Batouti,' Mr. Brokaw said. If an investigation were carried out in Egypt, 'It's conceivable you might find people who knew something about them both.'","2383":"As for the Bosnian Muslims, the film says there is ample evidence documenting Bosnians' alliance with Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.","2384":"Suspicious immigration officials at the airport noted that I had only a carry-on bag, stuffed with electronic gear, and that my passport had Pakistani and Afghan visas. Worried that I might be an agent of Osama bin Laden, they seized my passport and took me aside -- over the protests of the Information Ministry official who had come to the airport to welcome me and show me Yemeni hospitality.","2385":"He said he did not believe that Osama bin Laden or any other senior member of either group were in the valley during the American-led assault. Just the same, General Hagenbeck said, he wanted to be sure.","2386":"Mr. Cheney's meetings here come during a period of strain in American-Saudi relations. The American public is well aware that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the Sept. 11 attacks were Saudis. There have also been concerns that the Saudi authorities have not done enough to stem fund-raising for militants like Osama bin Laden.","2388":"It is a rare collection, the raw, unmediated stuff of the jihadis' lives. Individually, the documents are shards -- as mundane as a grocery list and as chilling as notes for the proper positioning of a truck bomb. But taken together, they tell a rich inside story of the network of radical Islamic groups that Osama bin Laden helped assemble in Afghanistan.","2389":"WASHINGTON\u2014 The actual text (and annotated subtext) of President Bush's remarks on Osama bin Laden at his press conference on Wednesday:","2390":"The Taliban and Al Qaeda resistance near Gardez was a bracing display for fighters who, despite their appearance as a ragged band of fanatics, had achieved a level of competence that American military officials say was on par with the world's best guerrilla forces. It also demonstrated the degree to which Osama bin Laden and other jihad leaders had turned Afghanistan's network of training bases and guest houses, typically described as terror schools, into a sort of two-tiered university for waging Islamic war.","2391":"American spooks worry that Yemen might provide a new base for terrorists like Osama bin Laden (who in a 1996 interview praised Yemen, his ancestral home, as a place in which he might settle). That's the reason for trying to bolster the government by training its army. It's a worthy goal, and if the training were conducted in the United States or in another country like Saudi Arabia it would not risk undermining the government's moral authority.","2393":"Not surprisingly, the authorities appear intent on seeking the harshest punishment possible in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui (no doubt partly out of frustration at the failure to apprehend Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar).","2394":"At one point, analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency also became suspicious of a fertilizer plant in Mazar-i-Sharif, which was situated near one of Osama bin Laden's compounds. The analysts feared that the plant's equipment could be used for chemical or biological weapons production.","2395":"Last November, when American officials believed that they had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, a large number of Al Qaeda forces, and possibly Mr. bin Laden himself, were thought to have slipped into Pakistan.","2396":"The warrant also states that the government is seeking 'any and all information' that refers to Osama bin Laden, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman -- the blind sheik who is serving a life term in prison for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center -- and several other people the government has designated as terrorists.","2397":"There is ample evidence that the Qaeda organization wanted weapons of mass destruction, including biological agents. Osama bin Laden is said to have considered the acquisition of such weapons a religious obligation.","2398":"That's why Osama bin Laden is not a mere terrorist. He has much larger aspirations. He is a super-empowered angry man who has all the geopolitical objectives and instincts of a nation-state. He has employed violence not to grab headlines but to kill as many Americans as possible to drive them out of the Islamic world and weaken their society. That's why the Sept. 11 hijackers never left a list of demands, as terrorists usually do. Their act was their demand. Their demand is total victory.","2400":"When the leaders of the same countries gathered in Japan two months ago to talk about Afghanistan, they pledged $4.5 billion to support a government whose economic policies might be described, generously, as inchoate. The biggest check on corruption may be that the Taliban already robbed the central bank of its last afghani. Yet the only string attached to Afghanistan's aid was the promise that it would remain friendly to the United States -- and keep Osama bin Laden in the hills.","2401":"Third, anger over the Palestinian issue is the most likely spark for domestic unrest during trying economic times, and it could help the recruitment efforts of the those, like Osama bin Laden, who attract recruits by denouncing Israel as they seek the violent overthrow of their own Arab governments.","2402":"An analysis of notebooks and papers collected from Afghan training bases and guest houses showed how Osama bin Laden and other jihad leaders created, in effect, a two-tiered university of holy war: a core curriculum of weapons instruction and battle tactics and, for standout fighters, specialized training in advanced infantry techniques or terrorist actions, like bomb-making and espionage. Whether they spoke Tajik, Uzbek or Arabic, the thousands of men who passed through these camps, in a dozen or so different locations in Afghanistan, copied into their own notebooks the same basic lessons -- some drawn directly from U.S. training manuals.","2403":"Mr. Sharon would be relaxing his tough stance by allowing the Palestinian leader to attend the Arab meeting unless he obtained some commitments from Mr. Arafat in return, like an agreement to an Israeli-Palestinian truce and steps to stop attacks by Palestinian militants. Without any moves by Mr. Arafat, allowing him to attend the Beirut meeting would be a very difficult political step for the prime minister, who has compared Mr. Arafat to Osama bin Laden. Indeed, the step would be all the more difficult after the Bush administration made it clear today that Mr. Arafat had not done enough to merit a meeting with Mr. Cheney.","2404":"WASHINGTON, March 24\u2014 Federal investigators are examining whether terrorist operations by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda and other Islamic groups were indirectly financed by at least two wealthy, well-connected Saudis through a maze of foundations, companies and financial institutions.","2405":"'It is hard to say what is the bigger threat to him, his allies or the Russians,' said Mr. Kutayev, the former deputy prime minister, who argues that Mr. Maskhadov opposes the extremists in the rebel command whose support comes from Arab and Afghan sources connected to Osama bin Laden.","2406":"In separate interviews, the tribal leaders, Pashtun Muslims, expressed other views the Bush administration would certainly find discouraging: that the core of American policy is a hatred of Muslims and that Osama bin Laden was not responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.","2407":"He sees the world not through one carefully assembled perspective, but through the comic equivalent of a fly's compound eye. He glances simultaneously at show business, news, history, religion, memories, puns, ethnic strife, everyday life and lust, making free-associative leaps with a grand illogic of their own. He suggested, for instance, that as fellow psychopaths, the Unabomber and Charles Manson could be sent after Osama bin Laden. He wondered how American culture might make inroads among Muslims, rejecting ideas like starting up wet burka contests or a kiddie show called 'Saudi Doody.'","2408":"FOR all the sophisticated electronic tools the United States government has at its investigative disposal, tracking the activities of suspected terrorist groups online has proved to be not unlike the search for Osama bin Laden and his operatives on the ground.","2409":"The Justice Department said that it would seek the death penalty for Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person arrested in the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Moussaoui is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda terrorist network.","2410":"The sad reality is that real moral and political leadership -- an effort to articulate a vision and take risks to persuade people to share it -- comes mostly from Osama bin Laden and other Islamists. Their vision may be harmful, frightening and deceitful, but they have one, and struggle to persuade people to follow them.","2411":"Mr. Moussaoui, who has pleaded not guilty, is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda terrorist network in the attacks.","2412":"In addition, after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Saudis stressed repeatedly that the first step toward ending the terrorism inspired by Osama bin Laden was to solve the Palestinian conflict, which inspires many in the Arab world to take up arms against the United States and its Arab allies.","2413":"One of the suspected Al Qaeda fighters who was captured in Pakistan on Thursday is believed to be Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, American and Pakistani officials said. 12","2415":"WASHINGTON, March 30\u2014 One of the suspected Qaeda fighters who was captured in Pakistan on Thursday is believed to be Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, American and Pakistani officials said today.","2416":"The British role in molding the theater of today's regional conflicts was by no means just military. With World War I under way, Britain and France reached a secret deal to carve up the Middle East. And that deal -- the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 -- was central to the western division of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1920's, a moment that, for radical Islamists like Osama bin Laden, is mourned as the final passing of the Muslim Caliphate that dated to the Prophet Muhammad and reviled as an episode of profound cultural humiliation.","2417":"American and Pakistani officials say they believe that Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, may be among the 30 Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured in Pakistan on Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the most significant apprehension of a Qaeda commander since the United States began its military campaign. Mr. Zubaydah, a 30-year-old Palestinian, has been trying to reorganize the terrorist network for new attacks against the United States, American officials say.","2418":"The Pakistani government has demonstrated how firmly it is in the camp of cooperation, most lately in allowing the F.B.I. and C.I.A. to conduct a raid with Pakistani police here last week that rounded up more than 30 men with suspected links to Al Qaeda. The raid also demonstrated how valuable that cooperation can be: one of those apprehended, Abu Zubaydah, is suspected of being a top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.","2419":"WASHINGTON, March 31\u2014 The man believed to be Abu Zubaydah, a top commander under Osama bin Laden, was seriously wounded when he was captured last week in Pakistan and is now in United States custody at an undisclosed location, American officials said today.","2420":"The pilot maneuvered the plane for a close look. Two spotters with high-powered binoculars scoured the sea. Another sat inside the plane's nose, which was made of clear plastic. Minutes passed. Nothing. Then, the man in the nose spotted something. But it was not Osama bin Laden or his men.","2421":"In recent days, government officials in Khost, the provincial capital, have cited reports from witnesses that Osama bin Laden and other senior members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban are operating in the Khost region on both sides of the border.","2422":"When Safouh Hamoui was arrested with his wife and three children in their suburban Seattle home at dawn on March 1, he was asked by F.B.I. agents what he thought about Osama bin Laden and the Sept. 11 terror attacks, according to his lawyer, Bernice Funk.","2423":"A terrible disaster is in the making in the Middle East. What Osama bin Laden failed to achieve on Sept. 11 is now being unleashed by the Israeli-Palestinian war in the West Bank: a clash of civilizations.","2424":"An important lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, Abu Zubaydah, was organizing new attacks on American targets when he was captured in Pakistan last week, officials said. A12","2425":"PESHAWAR, Pakistan, March 27\u2014 In this raucous border town, long a center of men and materi\u00e9l for wars in next-door Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden has fallen out of favor, and at least one industry is thriving on the change.","2426":"The Amman march today was the largest in the capital since Israel activated its intense assault on the West Bank on Friday. The protest included a huge contingent from the Muslim Brotherhood flaunting a picture of Osama bin Laden and chanting in favor of attacking Israel.","2427":"WASHINGTON, April 2\u2014 An important lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, Abu Zubaydah, was organizing new attacks on American targets when he was captured in Pakistan last week, Bush administration officials said today in confirming his arrest.","2428":"The White House said Abu Zubaydah, a top lieutenant to Osama bin Laden captured last week, had been plotting new attacks. Page A12.","2429":"A man suspected by the government of being a senior aide to Osama bin Laden plans to plead guilty today to charges that he tried to murder a federal jail guard in Manhattan in late 2000, according to people familiar with the case.","2430":"A man suspected by the government of being a senior aide to Osama bin Laden pleaded guilty yesterday to trying to kill a federal jail guard in Manhattan in November 2000. The defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, was scheduled to begin trial on the assault charges later this month. But yesterday, Judge Deborah A. Batts accepted his guilty plea in Federal District Court. Mr. Salim still faces terrorism conspiracy charges relating to the attacks on United States Embassies in Africa in 1998. Those charges are not affected by yesterday's plea, which was expected. Robert F. Worth (NYT)","2431":"But the new information, combined with recent intelligence indicating that Qaeda followers are regrouping in Pakistan and elsewhere, has heightened concern among counterterrorism officials that Osama bin Laden's network is determined to seek out new targets.","2432":"At least 75 people have been detained in a half dozen raids that began on March 27 with the biggest catch of them all, Abu Zubaydah, a top lieutenant of Osama bin Laden. American agents played a lead role in that raid, which seized at least 26 people altogether. Pakistani security officers say Americans have also been present during other raids.","2433":"He added, 'Would we want an organization representing Osama bin Laden having a headquarters here and being protected by our Police Department?'","2434":"Mr. Zubaydah, a 31-year-old Palestinian with close ties to Osama bin Laden, is the first man under American interrogation who likely has a map in his head of sleeper cells and terrorist operations around the world, both recent and those still planned. The head of operations for Al Qaeda and a chief of recruitment and terror training for the group, he almost certainly played a key role in the Sept. 11 attacks and in numerous other plots. His capture was a joint American-Pakistani operation, and Pakistan deserves both thanks and praise. It also deserves help, technical and financial, so that its intelligence and police services can become more efficient. Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, is trying to break the back of the powerful radical Islamist network in his country, although his efforts are far from perfect. The capture of Mr. Zubaydah, like the arrest of the suspected murderers of Daniel Pearl, is a success to be encouraged.","2435":"But then Mr. Merhi rose to introduce Representative Pascrell. Speaking without notes, Mr. Merhi faulted American foreign policy for allowing Osama bin Laden to take root in Afghanistan, and denounced the long detention of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11.","2436":"The poem, 'The Travail of a Child Who Has Left the Land of the Holy Shrines,' was found last fall in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan, once used by Al Qaeda fighters. The three-page printed poem clearly notes its two authors, 'the poet Dr. Abd-ar-Rahman al-Ashmawi' and 'Sheik Osama bin Laden.'","2437":"IT seems safe to class Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in that last category, bent as they are on destruction of what they see as a corrupt and competing civilization. 'I don't see any sort of halfway houses in that sort of rhetoric,' Mr. Fuerth said.","2438":"'Some of the stuff looked pretty old, but the locals said Osama bin Laden had been there,' said Capt. Lou Bauer, 29, of Windsor, N.Y.","2439":"The petitioners represent just some of possibly thousands of civilians who suffered in the campaign against the Taliban leadership and Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, that began exactly six months ago today. Global Exchange, a human rights organization based in San Francisco that is supporting the victims in their claims, estimates that about 2,000 families may have suffered losses in the bombing.","2440":"In a two-hour demonstration that congested traffic for several blocks around the plaza, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was the target of many speakers and placards, some comparing him to Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi who is the leader of the Qaeda terrorist network.","2441":"WASHINGTON\u2014 Sixty Islamic terrorists, trained in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden, are holed up in the town of Biyara in northern Iraq, guests of Saddam Hussein. Their assignment is to infiltrate the no-flight zone and to kill the Kurdish leaders, who Saddam assumes will be allied with the U.S. in his overthrow.","2443":"But in reality, the relationship was always somewhat charged. The Bush administration seemed irritated at Mr. Sharon's repeated equation of Washington's antiterrorism campaign with his war with the Palestinians, comparing Mr. Arafat with Osama bin Laden and the Palestine Liberation Organization with Al Qaeda.","2445":"Although the indictment charges that the Islamic Group has forged alliances with other terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, the terror network led by Osama bin Laden, Mr. Ashcroft said that there was no evidence linking the messages sent by Mr. Abdel Rahman to the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","2446":"In a nearby shop, two buyers sat on the carpet eating lunch with the owner, surrounded by guns. Behind them was a picture of Osama bin Laden.","2447":"Though the Bush administration says the company has secret links to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, its open corporate links were to Citibank for money transfers and to AT&amp;T for international calls, and it was negotiating with Coca-Cola to become a bottler.","2448":"In November, American officials announced that they had proof that the company, Al Barakaat, was providing as much as $25 million a year to Osama bin Laden's terrorists in weapons, cash and other support. With the help of dozens of countries, the Treasury Department froze nearly all the company's assets, paralyzing the biggest employer in one of the poorest countries.","2449":"A raid in Pakistan that turned up a top aide to Osama bin Laden last month suggests that the hunt for Al Qaeda fugitives may prove considerably more complicated than previously expected. PAGE 20","2450":"FAISALABAD, Pakistan, April 9\u2014 This industrial city deep in the interior of Pakistan was never high on the list of places deemed likely to provide sanctuary to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network.","2451":"DEAN KAMEN'S motorized scooter, conceived as Ginger and christened Segway, has sparked the public imagination like few other inventions in recent memory. A New Yorker cover recently featured Osama bin Laden making a getaway on a Segway. Last week, the television character Niles rode one on 'Frasier.'","2452":"'You don't meet with a terrorist,' said Rinat Shigris, 22, a university student.

But perhaps even more than the other Qaeda videos that have come to light in recent months, it strongly suggests the responsibility of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in the attacks.","2456":"KHARTOUM, Sudan\u2014 It's a measure of the rage spreading across the Middle East that even in this dusty capital, almost at the edge of the world, several hundred thousand people have marched through the streets denouncing Israel and America -- and in some cases cheering Osama bin Laden.","2457":"A man identified as a Sept. 11 hijacker said in a newly broadcast videotape that his death was meant to send the message that 'it is time to kill the Americans in their own homeland.' Another segment showed Osama bin Laden sitting contemplatively beside his second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. A20","2458":"But while the prosecutors have asserted that the men are part of an international terrorist movement and that all of the defendants received training in Afghanistan, little evidence has yet surfaced that provides a direct connection to Osama bin Laden or his Qaeda network.","2459":"Mr. Bishop left a note that said he was acting alone but supported the efforts of Al Qaeda, the terrorism network. The authorities have said they do not believe that the teenager had ties to terrorists. The note said Osama bin Laden was planning other terrorist acts, including 'blowing up the Super Bowl with an antiquated nuclear bomb left over from the 1967 Israeli-Syrian war.'","2460":"The United States destroyer Cole, damaged by a terrorist attack in Yemen that left a gaping hole in its side, is ready to return to action after 18 months of repairs that cost $250 million, the Navy said. On Friday, the Cole is scheduled to leave the shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., where the repairs were made, for the Navy base at Norfolk, Va., to be deployed, said Lt. Bill Speaks of the Navy. 'It's completely repaired,' he said. In October 2000, a small boat pulled alongside the destroyer in Aden harbor and blew up, killing 17 American crew members in an attack that the United States suspects was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.","2461":"WASHINGTON, April 17\u2014 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld reaffirmed his support today for the battle plan used to flush Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters last year from the mountains of Tora Bora in Afghanistan, and denied reports that the administration had concluded that Osama bin Laden was there but was able to escape.","2462":"Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld reaffirmed his support for the battle plan used in the mountains of Tora Bora in Afghanistan last year, and he denied reports that officials had concluded that Osama bin Laden was there but had escaped. A14","2463":"So when the current President Bush talked of the war on terrorism after Sept. 11, his reversals, according to Mr. Oates, contained phrases like 'I am avowed, we will get them' and 'Skies, we have seen the limit with terror.' At the same time, Mr. Oates found a more ominous note in the president's speeches. His phrase 'an act of war against our country,' when played backward, revealed the phrase 'Rule the planet.' Meanwhile, in a speech by Osama bin Laden, one of Mr. Oates's students discovered the reversal, 'Our government is wrong; terror now.'","2464":"Danny and I both wished we had been visiting Pakistan in a quieter time. But there we were. At our first meeting we heard from a group of women who advised the city of Karachi. They expressed anger at Western reporters for blaming the attacks on Muslim fundamentalists and Osama bin Laden without proof. They asked us to think carefully about our responsibilities as Westerners and as journalists. They said they were lovers of peace and were deeply offended by what they perceived as the West's attack on Islam.","2465":"Even so, there were growing suggestions that the man who received the telephone call had ties to Al Qaeda. The German television network ZDF as well as a Berlin newspaper reported today that a police search of the man's apartment had uncovered a phone number for a top suspect in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, Ramzi Muhammad Abdullah bin al-Shibh. Mr. Shibh was a close acquaintance of Mohamed Atta and other hijackers based in Hamburg. He tried to enter the United States, but was refused a visa because of his suspected links to Osama bin Laden. American investigators believe that he was to have been the 20th member of the hijacking team, and did in fact serve as a financial director by wiring money to members of the group.","2466":"Government officials said Mr. Zubaydah's statements after his capture this month in Pakistan were among several recent signs that Osama bin Laden's group might be gearing up for further attacks at home and overseas.","2467":"Al Rashid typifies the organizations cited in previous freeze orders, many of them Muslim-related charities or cultural organizations, although orders have also applied to some ordinary businesses that federal investigators say have helped Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2468":"Literature can rarely match everyday news of the world for horror and pain, but Sade provided us with illuminating tableaux vivants -- 18th-century close-ups of the action. In reading his work we find an echo of the eerie, opaque feeling many of us experienced watching the tape of Osama bin Laden and his friends cheerfully recalling the handiwork in the World Trade Center attacks. Why the opacity? And what is the powerful discomfort about?","2469":"AT a cheap Peruvian restaurant in Brooklyn, David Rees was telling a story, and it involved: a 1980's punk band called the Minutemen, America, Lenny Bruce, Vanity Fair magazine, Osama bin Laden and Mr. Rees's very funny, very profane online comic strip, 'Get Your War On.'","2470":"The alleged plot against the former king would not be the first; it also would not be the first time people posing as journalists tried to assassinate an Afghan political leader. In September, two men claiming to be television reporters detonated a bomb hidden inside a camera, killing Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the anti-Taliban resistance. American officials have said that that plot appeared to be orchestrated by Osama bin Laden in the days before the Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center.","2472":"New analysis of a videotape showing Osama bin Laden has concluded that the Al Qaeda terrorist network -- badly damaged during the war in Afghanistan -- is in the process of reconstituting itself.","2473":"Both defendants had seemed intent on provoking New Yorkers. One man told a crowd in Times Square a few days after Sept. 11 that 'more cops and firemen should have died.' The other, carrying a picture of Osama bin Laden, shouted near the World Trade Center ruins in early October that the attacks had been revenge against Americans.","2474":"'Osama bin Laden does not represent Palestine,' he said. 'If anyone wants to help our cause, they should come here and help us fight Israel. They should not go out and kill civilians around the world.'","2475":"With his remarks, Mr. Moussaoui, who lived for several years in Britain and proved himself today to be well versed in American legal jargon, embraced the government's description of him as a Muslim extremist who supported Osama bin Laden's call for the destruction of the United States.","2476":"One official said Mr. Zubaydah, believed to be Osama bin Laden's operations chief, 'is well positioned to know what Al Qaeda has been up to, and we have to take his information seriously.'","2477":"Another of Mr. Fortuyn's pitches -- that immigrants should accept the customs and learn the language of the countries that receive them -- also echoes the views of voters in other European countries, notably France and Britain as well as Germany, where people were stunned to discover that Islamic extremists linked to Osama bin Laden were operating with apparent impunity before Sept. 11.","2479":"'I admit to plotting to blow up a Jewish synagogue in France,' Mr. Beandali said, in a statement that his lawyer read in the courtroom this afternoon. But, he insisted repeatedly, he had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden or the Qaeda network. Nor, he insisted, did he ever want to injure or kill innocent people.","2480":"The London-based dailies Al Quds Al Arabi and Al Hayat said they had received a claim of responsibility from a group calling itself the Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Holy Sites. A group calling itself by the same name claimed responsibility for the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which more than 200 people were killed and which American authorities blamed on Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network.","2481":"Nangahar Province includes Tora Bora, the mountainous area where Osama bin Laden was last thought to be. Some American officials and Afghan leaders believe he slipped away in November or December during an American-led offensive there.","2482":"'Let's not say, woe is us, we are victims,' Ms. Matalin said. 'Look what we get to be a part of. Look at what our kids get exposed to. Matty knows who Osama bin Laden is and Emma asks if Arafat is a bad man.'","2483":"Mr. Ansary, a California writer and editor, has put this and much else into 'West of Kabul, East of New York,' a book that steadies our skittering compass. Pointing east and west it signals not galactic opposites but two ends of a needle we can hold in our hand. Mr. Ansari loathes Osama bin Laden and fears what he stands for, something lucidly set out at the end. But it is part of himself that our bombs hit, as well. No windy feeling, this, but as homely as his reaction to a talk-show caller who suggested nuking:","2484":"WASHINGTON, April 25\u2014 American officials said today that they had verified the accuracy of some of the information provided by a captured senior leader of Al Qaeda, and expressed cautious optimism that he would eventually divulge more detailed information about the terrorist network and the whereabouts of its surviving leaders, including Osama bin Laden.","2485":"'The names of the groups are not important,' said Rolf Tophoven, an analyst in Bonn and author of numerous books on terrorism. 'We have to assume today that not all terrorism comes from Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda provided the impulse, but you have isolated groups around the world that do not require a command from Iraq and do not have to be steered by Osama bin Laden. There are often links, but this is a very loose grouping.'","2486":"Both Russian and some American officials say Khattab has links to Osama bin Laden, and the rebel leader is widely said to have set up training camps in the Chechen highlands for guerrillas and explosive experts from a number of nations.","2487":"But the fear is that some of the very warlords likely to disrupt the loya jirga process, or to try to control it through bribery and intimidation, are allied with American military forces in their campaign to find Osama bin Laden. If foreign money makes its way into the selection procedures, that, too, follows Afghan tradition. Few experts doubt that Russia, Iran and maybe Pakistan are players behind the scenes.","2488":"But others at the State Department and the White House argue that efforts to topple Mr. Hussein would be viewed by Arabs as a confrontation with Islam, destabilizing the region and complicating the broader campaign against Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.","2490":"Mr. Zadran, a recipient of such support, has been quick to point out suspected members of Al Qaeda, so much so that some here believe he simply identifies all his political foes as associates of Osama bin Laden.","2491":"The government of President Eduard A. Shevardnadze has been unable to establish control over the Pankisi Gorge near Chechnya, where armed men -- some thought to have links with Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network -- have found refuge, American officials said.","2492":"WASHINGTON, April 30\u2014 The Justice Department arrested the head of an Islamic charity in Illinois today and said there was extensive evidence that he and his organization had close ties to Osama bin Laden and had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","2493":"Mr. Moussaoui is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network in the Sept. 11 attacks. The case against him appears to rely largely on the similarities between his actions over the last year -- he sought flight training and is reported to have received money from Al Qaeda -- and those of the 19 hijackers.","2494":"Federal agents in Illinois arrested an Islamic charity's director, saying the Benevolence International Foundation had ties to Osama bin Laden and funneled money to Al Qaeda. A22","2495":"The Justice Department arrested the head of an Islamic charity in Chicago, saying that he and his organization had funneled money to Al Qaeda and had close ties to Osama bin Laden. Enaam M. Arnaout, 39, the Syrian-born director of the Benevolence International Foundation, was charged with lying under oath.","2496":"The government has said that the search of the apartment turned up several computer-generated photographs of Osama bin Laden, and that a box cutter was found in his car.","2497":"The Justice Department made public information tying a wealthy Saudi businessman, Mohamad Jamal Khalifa, who is Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, to people convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terror plots and to a Chicago-based Islamic charity. A23","2498":"In supporting its arrest of the leader of an Islamic charity this week, the Justice Department has made public new information tying a wealthy Saudi businessman, who is Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, to several people convicted in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 or in unsuccessful plots to bring down airliners and assassinate the pope.","2499":"In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Washington has repeatedly pressed Indonesia, where a shaky economic and democratic transition is under way, to take firmer action against groups and individuals suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden and his terrorism network, Al Qaeda.","2500":"As hundreds more coalition troops have been sent into the rolling hills and craggy mountains of eastern Afghanistan, an Afghan intelligence official said Osama bin Laden himself had been spotted twice in recent weeks just over the border in the tribal areas of Pakistan. In Washington, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld discounted such reports.","2501":"The Justice Department made public information tying a wealthy Saudi businessman, Mohamad Jamal Khalifa, who is Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law, to people convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terror plots and to a Chicago-based Islamic charity. A23","2502":"It's quite a task; a poll last fall found that 82 percent of urban Pakistanis regard Osama bin Laden as a freedom fighter. Pakistan's intelligence agency is responsible for more terrorist killings than Al Qaeda. The country has been on the edge of bankruptcy, 55 percent of adults are illiterate, 10 percent of children die by the age of 5, and there are more drug addicts than college graduates.","2503":"Imagine a team sent to investigate American military action in Afghanistan without reference to the attacks of Sept. 11 or Osama bin Laden's boasts that he would destroy America. And imagine asking that investigation to ignore the sanctuary the Taliban gave Mr. bin Laden and his Qaeda operatives despite previous American warnings.","2504":"A U.S. diplomat in Jakarta told me she had just visited the town of Malang, in East Java, and had seen an Indonesian boy there wearing an Osama bin Laden T-shirt and a New York Yankees cap. So all isn't lost. But we must make sure that he grows into the hat, not the T-shirt.","2505":"The Taliban banned poppy growing under American pressure two summers ago, in an effort to win an easing of stifling economic sanctions that had been imposed because of its harboring of Osama bin Laden. But Ghanikhel kept on trading, and while its supplies dwindled, its prices shot up.","2506":"What is not lost on those building this strategy is the continuing search on both sides of the rugged border area for their most notorious quarry, Osama bin Laden. 'If there's a large pocket left in that tribal area, bin Laden is most likely in it,' a senior military officer said. But he added that American officials had no firm intelligence on Mr. bin Laden's precise whereabouts.","2507":"Indeed, finding someone here who has actually seen an American soldier is almost as hard as finding Osama bin Laden himself.","2508":"But Osama bin Laden's tricycle was probably gold-plated, and we all know that the 9/11 hijackers came from privileged backgrounds. Look at ETA in Spain, Red Brigades in Italy, Aum Shinrikyo in Japan, the I.R.A. in Ireland or Timothy McVeigh: they suggest middle-class alienation rather than third-world deprivation.","2509":"Pentagon officials have privately acknowledged that they probably missed their best opportunity of the war to catch the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, by relying too heavily on Afghan allies to encircle Tora Bora while American and other coalition Special Operations forces hunted for adversaries. Mr. bin Laden is believed to have slipped into Pakistan on one of the many trails that lace the region.","2510":"The first time I saw Reno's 'Rebel Without a Pause' exactly five weeks had passed since Sept. 11. We were all still pretty shaky, and the idea of turning the World Trade Center disaster into humor was questionable. (Well, you could ridicule Osama bin Laden at that point, but that was all.)","2511":"Canadian troops and American criminal investigators have exhumed 23 bodies from a grave site in the Tora Bora mountains that they suspect are remains of Al Qaeda fighters, perhaps a security contingent for Osama bin Laden.

Rather, it's that despite the buzz of activity -- such as doffing our shoes at airports -- we as a nation can't seem to get ahead of the curve in avoiding the next catastrophe, by taking steps such as controlling loose nukes, learning how to decontaminate after anthrax attacks, examining checked baggage, checking shipping containers and reducing the risk from states like Iraq or North Korea.","2514":"In his complaint, Mr. Wright said the funds were linked to Yassin Qadi, a Saudi businessman, whom the federal government designated last October as a financial supporter of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Qadi has denied links to terrorists.","2515":"A 33-year-old Muslim fundamentalist, Mr. Moussaoui is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda, in the attacks, but prosecutors have released no evidence tying him directly to the 19 suicide hijackers.","2516":"While the documentary focuses on a family's loss, the boys' experiment is a reminder of how dramatically our view of the world has changed since that day. Not nearly as many people in this country would mistake Poland for Afghanistan now, nor would they be at a loss to name Osama bin Laden as the terrorist leader. Much of that instant education came from television, which in the early days provided both news and comfort. Then followed explication, in an onslaught of documentaries. The broadcast networks and cable channels have covered the rise of terrorism, the roots of Islam, the sociology of Afghanistan, the structural history of the World Trade Center and even the fate of pets living at ground zero (an Animal Planet production).","2517":"Canadian troops and U.S. investigators found what might be the graves of a security unit for Osama bin Laden killed in a Dec. 15 airstrike in Tora Bora. They unearthed 23 bodies and took DNA samples.","2518":"LONDON, May 11\u2014 A British judge ruled on Friday that an Algerian accused of being the leader of a London-based Al Qaeda cell and of plotting with Osama bin Laden to blow up Los Angeles International Airport on the eve of the millennium celebrations should be extradited to the United States.","2519":"A British judge ruled that an Algerian accused of being the leader of a London-based Qaeda cell and of plotting with Osama bin Laden to blow up Los Angeles International Airport should be extradited to the United States. 11","2520":"That was not the case just after Sept. 11, when the administration privately rebuked Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for trying to equate Yasir Arafat with Osama bin Laden, head of the terrorist network linked to the attacks.","2521":"CHICAGO, May 13\u2014 A judge refused today to dismiss perjury charges against an Islamic charity and its director accused of lying about ties to Osama bin Laden and his network.","2523":"Before Sept. 11 few people in the United States had heard of Al Jazeera, the Arabic-language satellite channel that instantly became infamous with its broadcasts of Osama bin Laden.","2524":"Senior Indian officials say the Americans are not doing enough to pressure Pakistan to crack down on the militants, perhaps because the United States is so reliant on General Musharraf for help in hunting for Osama bin Laden and his followers. They are regularly galled when American officials praise the general for the steps he has taken against Islamic extremists.","2525":"The same is true inside the Bush administration. The State Department sees the Mideast war as a war over Israel's 1967 boundaries, and its focus is 'conflict resolution' -- diplomacy aimed at getting Israel to trade occupied land for peace. But over at the Pentagon, the view is that Yasir Arafat is no different from Osama bin Laden, and the other Arab leaders are worthy only of contempt. The Pentagon sees the Israeli war to crush Mr. Arafat as an extension of the U.S. war on terrorism and believes that the most you can do with Arabs and Israelis today is 'conflict management,' not conflict resolution.","2526":"WASHINGTON, May 14\u2014 The classified memorandum written by an F.B.I. agent in Phoenix last summer urging bureau headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools also cited Osama bin Laden by name and suggested that his followers could use the schools to train for terror operations, government officials said for the first time today.","2527":"The films are shot in scrambled order, which intensifies their eerie timelessness. Every 'new' 'Star Wars' movie is a preprogrammed march toward the incompetent cyborg fascism of Darth Vader. It's hard to imagine how the series will ever manage without Vader -- it would be like Milton without Satan -- but in 2002, Obi-Wan Kenobi has finally come into his own as an iconic figure. A bearded, slippery mystic hiding in the desert: old Ben Kenobi could be mistaken for Osama bin Laden. Maybe he could be pressed into service as the new Dark Side of the Force.","2528":"The classified memo written by an F.B.I. agent in Phoenix last summer, urging headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools, cited Osama bin Laden by name and suggested his followers might use the schools to train for terror operations.

A1","2532":"Relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks had a variety of reactions yesterday to news that President Bush had been warned that followers of Osama bin Laden might hijack American planes. Mostly, their concerns centered on how the country could protect itself against future terrorist attacks, so others did not have to experience their grief.","2533":"The story line of the Sept. 11 terror attacks would unquestionably be a lot tidier if we knew that President Bush had been warned about possible strikes and done nothing to prevent them. That's why Washington is buzzing about the disclosure that the Central Intelligence Agency told Mr. Bush early last August that Osama bin Laden might try to hijack airplanes. But tragedies of the magnitude of Sept. 11 are rarely so neatly explained. Until someone produces evidence that the Bush administration received and ignored information pointing directly to the suicide hijackings, the country will have to live with the much messier and no less disturbing fact that the government as a whole dropped the ball and even now is not doing nearly enough to ensure that it doesn't happen again.","2534":"The White House, moving to contain political damage from its disclosure that the C.I.A. told President Bush in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking, said the assessment was contained in an 'analytic report' that was not based on specific intelligence that terrorists were planning the Sept. 11 attacks. A1","2535":"WASHINGTON, May 16\u2014 Confronting a political uproar over its disclosure that President Bush was cautioned last August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking, the White House said today that the assessment was in a C.I.A. analysis that was not based on specific intelligence of any pending attack.","2536":"The general idea that Osama bin Laden might attack American airlines had been public for months. The aviation agency publishes an annual report called Criminal Acts Against Aviation, and the 2000 edition, published on the agency's Web site in 2001, said that although Mr. bin Laden 'is not known to have attacked civil aviation, he has both the motivation and the wherewithal to do so.'","2538":"The sharp questions about possible intelligence lapses and about the vigor of the administration's response to terrorist warnings came a day after the White House announced, eight months after the terror attacks, that President Bush had been alerted by the Central Intelligence Agency last summer to the danger of hijackings by terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden.","2539":"WASHINGTON, May 17\u2014 The White House began an aggressive attack on Democrats in Congress today as President Bush tried to contain the political fury over a warning he received last August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking.","2540":"The White House assailed Congressional Democrats who it said were trying to exploit politically the furor over a warning given President Bush in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. Democrats were taken aback by the intensity of the Republican offensive. A1","2541":"Qaeda and Islamic extremists had already tried to destroy the World Trade Center towers in 1993. Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and others had designs to destroy infrastructure like New York's Lincoln Tunnel. Qaeda terrorists had killed hundreds in the 1998 attacks against American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. On the eve of the millennium, an operative linked to Osama bin Laden, Ahmed Ressam, tried to sneak into the United States to bomb Los Angeles International Airport. And a Qaeda affiliate, Ramzi Yousef, had developed plans to blow up a dozen American jumbo jets in the mid-1990's. By the late 1990's, intelligence services should have recognized that Qaeda hijackers would be likely to kill everyone on board any plane they seized.","2542":"The White House reacted with anger today at the criticism from several prominent Democrats after the disclosure on Wednesday that President Bush was informed on Aug. 6 that Osama bin Laden's terror network might be planning jet hijackings. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said that any Congressional inquiry should be 'free from politics.'","2543":"The White House learned in February 2001 that Osama bin Laden had discussed hijacking a Pakistani airliner with the son of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman at a meeting earlier that year in Afghanistan, according to current and former administration officials.","2544":"An Arabic-language newspaper also reported today that it had received recorded statements said to be from the fugitive Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. He is reported to have said that Osama bin Laden is alive, that the war in Afghanistan is not over and that American forces in Afghanistan will suffer 'fire, hell and total defeat.'","2545":"Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, says that despite last summer's warnings that terrorists linked to Osama bin Laden were planning major attacks and airplane hijackings, 'I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center' (front page, May 17).","2546":"WASHINGTON, May 17\u2014 The F.B.I. had been aware for several years that Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network were training pilots in the United States and elsewhere around the world, according to court records and interviews at flight schools and with federal law enforcement officials.","2547":"Last week, Democrats in Congress pounced on a disclosure that President Bush was cautioned last August -- the month before the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York and Washington -- that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. The White House responded that the warnings weren't based on specific intelligence, and Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said, 'I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile.'","2548":"First, there were new details about an F.B.I. memo written last summer, in which an agent urged an inquiry into the Middle Eastern men enrolled in American flight schools. For the first time, government officials said that the memo mentioned Osama bin Laden and suggested his followers might use the flight schools to train for terrorist operations. Then the White House announced, in response to a CBS News report, that intelligence agencies had warned President Bush in August that Mr. bin Laden was seeking to hijack jets.","2549":"The death of Mr. Basra is a reminder that in this part of the world terrorism is not limited to Osama bin Laden. Pakistan and its neighbors crawl with groups like Mr. Basra's Lashkar-i-Jangvi. But they have usually reserved their wrath for fellow Muslims, and have not become well known in the West.","2550":"The failure to prevent Sept. 11 was not a failure of intelligence or coordination. It was a failure of imagination. Even if all the raw intelligence signals had been shared among the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the White House, I'm convinced that there was no one there who would have put them all together, who would have imagined evil on the scale Osama bin Laden did.","2551":"The F.B.I. man figured out that Osama bin Laden might have dispatched followers to flight schools in Arizona and elsewhere to train them for a coordinated terrorist operation that would infiltrate our airlines.","2552":"Last week, Democrats in Congress pounced on a disclosure that President Bush was cautioned last August -- the month before the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York and Washington -- that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. The White House responded that the warnings weren't based on specific intelligence, and Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said, 'I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile.'","2553":"LONDON, May 19\u2014 A British-based Islamic news agency released a videotape today of Osama bin Laden that it said was filmed just two months ago. But the independent Arab satellite news network Al Jazeera said it had seen the tape three or four months ago and believed it was recorded in October.","2554":"This harsh southern province, a place of bare mountains and sun-baked valleys, is where most of the Taliban's leaders were born and brought up. While Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda followers appear to have moved eastward toward the Pakistan border after the collapse of the Taliban's government, Mullah Omar is thought to have taken to the mountains north of Kandahar where the mujahedeen survived for years fighting the Soviet Army.","2555":"WASHINGTON, May 20\u2014 Attorney General John Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, were told a few days after the Sept. 11 attacks that the F.B.I. had received a memorandum from its Phoenix office the previous July warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools, government officials said today.","2556":"With old and new warnings of terror attacks whizzing around Washington, it's becoming hard to follow what really matters, which is preventing another assault by Osama bin Laden and his followers. There's a place for debate about issues like whether Congressional committees or a special commission should investigate the government's response to terrorism before Sept. 11. But there is a danger that talk will become a substitute for action on the problems that desperately need fixing. That includes the performance of agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and even the Social Security Administration, which routinely assigns Social Security numbers to foreigners who submit fake documents.","2557":"The report said that the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya appeared to have curtailed its support for groups with links to terrorist activities, while Sudan had arrested groups tied to terrorism. Sudan provided harbor for years for Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network, and elements of Al Qaeda are reported to continue to use the east African nation as a base, although not with active government support.","2558":"No, it's not over. And yes, I too will say for the record that sometime, somewhere, there will be another attack. But in the meantime we've actually accomplished a lot. If Osama bin Laden is alive, a big if, his ability to direct acts of terrorism against U.S. targets has been disrupted. It is doubtful that he would dare even use a telephone.","2559":"Mullah Omar, Afghanistan's former leader, is one of the world's most wanted men, since he gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network in 1996 and allowed him to operate and acquire enormous power and influence in the country. Mullah Omar is widely reported to be hiding in his home province since fleeing Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual center, in December.","2560":"The threat of a war that would jeopardize the American hunt for Osama bin Laden is India's leverage to get Washington to pay attention to what is sees as Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism against India.","2561":"But they said the request failed to unearth the F.B.I. memorandum warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools.","2562":"Unlike Hamas and other terrorist groups whose actions are consistent, predictable and who quickly claim responsibility, Osama bin Laden relies heavily upon his elusiveness. This may be one of his most effective weapons.","2563":"The issue of whether the bureau missed possible warning signals before Sept. 11 has dominated Washington this week, as members of Congress have conducted closed briefings with an agent in the bureau's Phoenix office who wrote a memorandum last July warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools.","2564":"In the weeks before Sept. 11, a 38-year veteran of Pakistan's nuclear program, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, was discovered to have visited with Osama bin Laden at least twice in Afghanistan, where the two are reported to have discussed nuclear weapons.","2565":"That's history, and no amount of spin from either Bush or Clinton apologists is going to rewrite it. That's also why the question of what the president knew about terrorism on Sept. 11, though important, is hardly the most pressing now, Washington hysteria notwithstanding. Nearly nine months have passed since the day that was supposed to change everything, and Osama bin Laden and most of his top associates, Mullah Omar included, have not been found, dead or alive. The most important question is not how ready we were to fight terrorism on Sept. 11, 2001, but how ready we are to do so as of Memorial Day weekend 2002.","2566":"In her letter, Ms. Rowley criticizes assertions by F.B.I. leaders that the bureau's failure to act on the Moussaoui case and other clues last summer did not make a difference in preventing the attacks. She said that if the same officials at F.B.I. headquarters who handled the search warrant request from the Minneapolis office had been aware of a July memo from an agent in the F.B.I.'s Phoenix office warning that terrorists connected with Osama bin Laden might be trying to go to American flight schools, the Moussaoui case would have been handled differently.","2567":"But officials who have reviewed the July memorandum said that rather than having Mr. Hanjour in his sights, Mr. Williams was focused on a handful of other flight students, including some with ties to a radical British group called Al Muhajiroun, which has stridently supported Osama bin Laden and other terrorists.","2568":"Effectively defending the United States against terrorism requires a full and unflinching understanding of the governmental failures that left the nation so vulnerable to attack on Sept. 11. As evidence mounts of monumental ineptitude and bureaucratic bumbling by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies, it has become obvious that the job exceeds the grasp of the narrowly focused and poorly managed House and Senate intelligence committees. President Bush and Congress should move immediately to establish an independent investigative commission with the authority, expertise and financial support necessary to determine why Washington failed to recognize that Osama bin Laden was on the hunt in America last summer.","2569":"Eight and a half months into the war, the biggest achievement is that the Taliban has been routed in Afghanistan, and the United Nations is trying to install something resembling a real government there. That may or may not prove beneficial for the long-suffering Afghan people. The problem is that this is not why the United States went into Afghanistan. The target of the operation, Osama bin Laden, is still at large, and his Qaeda network has been battered and disrupted, but not crushed. So more attacks remained a distinct and dismaying possibility, as the Bush administration's warnings made clear last week.","2570":"To keep its message to the American public simple, the Bush administration has lumped all of these places into a pot with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network. But many indigenous anti-American movements are growing because of the war on terror.","2571":"WASHINGTON, May 25\u2014 Ask Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld about hunting for Osama bin Laden, and the subject invariably turns to poultry.","2572":"Surely by the morning of Sept. 12, however, when we were begging Muslim societies to help hunt Osama bin Laden, no go-it-aloner would deny Nye's point. He duly amended his manuscript and even says that the attacks on New York and Washington sounded his alarm 'far more effectively than any pen could.' But he responds only weakly to his own challenge that 'we still need to determine how to use the current decades of our pre-eminence to advance long-term national and global interests.'","2574":"WASHINGTON\u2014 It's not surprising that many officials in Washington are talking about convening an independent panel to investigate the federal government's actions before the Sept. 11 attacks. We now know that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was warned by an agent in its Phoenix office in July 2001 that operatives of Osama bin Laden could be studying at American flight schools and yet President Bush was not told until recently about the warning. We also know that Mr. Bush was shown a daily intelligence report in August 2001 indicating that Qaeda members were threatening to hijack American planes, but we do not know much about its context. Given these revelations, we will see various investigations -- within the F.B.I. and other agencies, by Congress, and perhaps even by a blue-ribbon commission of the kind appointed by Lyndon Johnson to study the John F. Kennedy assassination and by Ronald Reagan to study the Challenger disaster. It's a sign of our democracy's health that Americans tend to question government even during national crises; a half-dozen Congressional, military and other panels investigated Pearl Harbor while Americans were still dying in World War II.","2575":"In early 1994, Osama bin Laden spent three months in London, where he visited supporters and bankers and went to watch the famous soccer club Arsenal four times. Before returning to Sudan just a step ahead of being extradited to Saudi Arabia, he bought his sons gifts from the club's souvenir shop. His affection for the game did not stop him from getting involved in a plot to massacre the American and British teams at the 1998 World Cup in France; still, bin Laden told friends he had never seen passion like that of soccer fans.","2576":"Though the Caliphate has not been linked explicitly to Al Qaeda, German authorities have said that the group sent a delegation to meet with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan the year before their planned attack on Ataturk's mausoleum.","2578":"But it was on that morning, not long after his four-mile run, that Mr. Bush sat down in his ranch house for his daily intelligence briefing. It was delivered not by his usual briefer, George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, but by a low-level C.I.A. officer. At some point, the briefer told Mr. Bush that Osama bin Laden's followers in Al Qaeda might hijack commercial jets in the United States -- a dated fragment of information based on a single 1999 British intelligence report.","2579":"There have been reports from Pakistan that Osama bin Laden, the head of Al Qaeda, has been seen in the tribal areas as recently as last month. But General Hagenbeck said he had no solid information on the whereabouts of Mr. bin Laden or Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader.","2580":"An F.B.I. investigation two years ago that was apparently linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network was hampered by problems with the bureau's e-mail wiretap system.","2581":"Last October, on the day the American bombings began in Afghanistan, President Musharraf replaced the former head of the spy agency, General Mehmood Ahmed who, according to diplomats and Pakistani intelligence experts, had grown so close to the Taliban government that he urged its chief, Mullah Muhammad Omar, to resist any demands to hand over Osama bin Laden.","2582":"Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a persistent critic of the bureau, said he was unsure if the changes Mr. Mueller was said to be planning would accomplish the goal of 'changing the agency from one that goes after Bonnie and Clyde to one that directs its attention to the likes of Osama bin Laden.'","2583":"Senior officials said today that Mr. Ashcroft's new guidelines addressed some of Ms. Rowley's complaints. Ms. Rowley, general counsel in the Minneapolis office, also complained that agents there had no idea that an agent in Phoenix wrote in a memorandum to headquarters in July that Arab men, possibly connected to Osama bin Laden, had trained at a flight school in Arizona.","2584":"Now shift from reactive to proactive orientation. In my own mind, the bureau has done a superb job -- and particularly the New York office -- in investigating Osama bin Laden, particularly the World Trade Center, where defendants were prosecuted effectively in New York City, and are spending life terms in jail. The defendants who were prosecuted for the 1998 embassy bombings, convicted -- many of them spending life in jail. The F.B.I. has done a terrific job in putting those cases together. What we need to do better is be predictive. We have to be proactive. We have to develop the capability to anticipate attacks. We have to develop the capability of looking around corners. And that is the change. That is the shift in focus particularly at headquarters. No longer can we be a traffic cop sending E.C.'s here, E.C.'s there -- E.C., electronic communications. But we have to take a management and a responsibility role for assuring that the investigations are going well, and that we are gathering and getting the intelligence we need to prevent additional attacks.","2585":"But that stance became increasingly untenable in recent weeks after news reports that two F.B.I. field offices might have had important pieces of information that were never connected by officials at headquarters. Agent Kenneth Williams of the Phoenix office sent a memo on July 10 warning that Osama bin Laden might be sending operatives to American aviation schools to prepare for terrorist operations.","2586":"Timeliness in a play is not generally something to complain about, but 'One Shot, One Kill' by Richard Vetere at Primary Stages takes unsavory advantage of our current concern for national defense. It may not even be deliberate; I don't know whether the play was written before or after Sept. 11. The references to Osama bin Laden and the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon might be recent addenda. But in any case this is a moment when the sacrifices made by men and women for their country loom unassailable, and our sympathy for those who are willing to serve America ahead of their families, themselves or their consciences is fervent and instantaneous.","2587":"One indicator of the paralytic fear of risk-taking was how F.B.I. headquarters responded to the memorandum written last July by an agent from Phoenix. The agent, Kenneth J. Williams, urged a broad survey of American aviation schools based on his concern that Middle Eastern men, possibly connected to Osama bin Laden, were training at a flight school in Arizona.","2588":"The president should snap out of his jet lag, summon his national security team (Tenet and Rove) and issue a single remorseless instruction: 'Bring me the head of Osama bin Laden. Or Bob Mueller.'","2589":"A few years ago, Mr. Asharaf would have voted -- had any such vote been held -- to unite mostly Muslim Kashmir with Pakistan. But no longer. He said the turning point was when Pakistanis and Afghans who had been trained in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, which were run by Osama bin Laden, effectively took over what had been an indigenous Kashmiri guerrilla army.","2590":"The video clip for 'Without You' makes Eminem a one-man cable service, placing him on talk shows, reality shows and a news channel (ENN) that depicts him holed up in a cave dressed as Osama bin Laden (to be attacked by members of Eminem's occasional hip-hop collective, D12). In a sketchy plot line, the clip shows Eminem, costumed like Robin, and his mentor, Dr. Dre, behind the wheel of the Rapmobile, parodying another media franchise, 'Batman.' On the album, 'Business' repeats the Batman bit for an entire song. Eminem invoked another movie franchise on his 2001 European tour when he arrived onstage wearing a hockey mask like Jason from 'Friday the 13th.'","2591":"Essam Al Ridi, an Egyptian-American pilot, has seen Osama bin Laden and his world of militant Islam up close, and he is one of the few people who helped prosecutors penetrate it long before Sept. 11.","2592":"'That guy -- surely we would have to kill him,' Mr. Oltetia, the village's chief warrior, said of Osama bin Laden. 'We as the Masai have ways to kill, just using a spear and bows and arrows.'","2593":"In this remote mountainous region abutting Afghanistan, religious fundamentalism has long flourished and heavily armed tribesmen, rather than the central government, have always defined the law. The United States suspects that these dusty badlands are the redoubt of the remnants of the Taliban, Al Qaeda and perhaps Osama bin Laden himself.","2594":"Mr. Davis is bombarding Mr. Hilliard with commercials that depict him as an embarrassment. One contrasts images of ground zero with a bill Mr. Hilliard offered to lift sanctions against countries that sponsor terrorism. Mr. Hilliard is shown smiling and clapping opposite pictures of Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi.","2595":"CAIRO, June 3\u2014 Egyptian intelligence warned American officials about a week before Sept. 11 that Osama bin Laden's network was in the advance stages of executing a significant operation against an American target, President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview on Sunday.","2596":"WASHINGTON, June 3\u2014 Early on Sept. 11, Senator Bob Graham and Representative Porter J. Goss were having a quiet breakfast meeting in the Capitol with the chief of Pakistani intelligence, Lt. Gen. Mehmood Ahmed. Mr. Graham and Mr. Goss, the chairmen of the two Congressional intelligence committees, were quizzing their guest about Osama bin Laden and other issues when an aide to Mr. Goss rushed in with a note.","2597":"The Senate Judiciary Committee's proceedings were also closed to the public. Lawmakers on that panel focused on the memorandum by Kenneth Williams, the agent in Phoenix. In that memo, addressed to David Frasca, chief of the F.B.I.'s radical fundamentalist unit, Mr. Williams warned that Osama bin Laden's followers might be training for terror operations at American flight schools. Top F.B.I. officials were unaware of the memorandum until a few days after Sept. 11.","2598":"The man described as a possible relative, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, 37, a Kuwaiti, is now believed to have been a leading figure in Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network who helped plan the attacks, officials said.","2599":"Yes, Egypt has been threatened by Al Qaeda too. But Egypt's way of cracking down has been to either arrest or expel radical Islamic leaders and then leave an ideological vacuum in their wake. The reason a psychopath like Osama bin Laden -- with his Arab, Islamic but backward-looking message -- could gain such currency is because no one in the Arab world, particularly Egypt, has articulated an Arab, Islamic, progressive, democratic alternative to counter him.","2600":"Still, it would be terribly n\u00e4ive not to recognize the semantic tension here. A virtuous religious word has been perversely used by the likes of Osama bin Laden and his followers and now conjures up images of planes crashing into buildings. Some say that because jihad now means such drastically different things to different people, we should avoid such a divisive theme at a celebratory event.","2601":"When he spoke out against the Democrats three weeks ago, Mr. Cheney was trying to contain the fury over the first disclosure of a missed clue, one about a briefing that Mr. Bush received in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking.","2602":"They said agents were now going back through several terrorism cases from the 1990's to see if they could pick up clearer threads about when Mr. Mohammed became part of Mr. Yousef's determined group of Islamic extremists. They said the bureau was also focusing on when Mr. Mohammed teamed up with Osama bin Laden.","2603":"But because the administration continues to listen only to the usual suspects, that window of opportunity is closing fast. And bear this in mind: Whatever he imagines, Osama bin Laden can't destroy Western civilization. Carbon dioxide can.","2604":"He also spoke to her about Al Qaeda and praised Osama bin Laden.","2605":"In Ms. Rowley's memorandum last month, which became known to news organizations within days of its delivery to the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, she said that the 'reasonable suspicion' that Mr. Moussaoui was a terrorist 'quickly ripened into probable cause' in mid-August 'when the French intelligence service confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups and activities connected to Osama bin Laden.'","2606":"The prosecutors said the findings of the psychiatrist, Dr. Raymond Patterson, were in part based on a two-hour interview with Mr. Moussaoui, a Muslim militant who is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda network in the attacks. Officials have described Mr. Moussaoui, 34, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, as the 20th hijacker.","2607":"When it comes to striking terror in a White House waging a war on terrorism, Osama bin Laden has nothing on a forthright American woman spilling her guts on daytime television.","2608":"The F.B.I. and C.I.A. have been after Mr. Mohammed for years, even before they knew he was linked to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Investigators believe he played a leading role in helping to finance and plan Mr. Yousef's 1995 plot to blow up airliners over the Pacific. In late 1994 and early 1995, Mr. Mohammed lived in Mr. Yousef's apartment in Manila, where they kept explosive devices and chemicals for use in the airliner operation, court documents say.","2609":"In particular, they said, Congressional investigators are trying to determine whether the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. overlooked a possible Qaeda connection to the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993. The United States has not officially blamed Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden for that operation.","2610":"LYON, France\u2014 The 24-year-old Tunisian blamed for the attack on an ancient synagogue in Tunisia this spring, an assault considered the deadliest by operatives linked to Osama bin Laden since Sept. 11, was a surprising convert to Islamic militancy, intelligence officials have concluded.","2611":"The 24-year-old Tunisian who is determined to have carried out the attack on a synagogue in Tunisia this spring, in what is considered the deadliest assault by operatives linked to Osama bin Laden since Sept. 11, was a surprising convert to Islamic militancy, intelligence officials have concluded. 22","2612":"If the United States is going to go after groups like Abu Sayyaf, whose links to Osama bin Laden are tenuous, the list of further targets is potentially long.","2613":"They know that Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar very possibly remain at large, that Qaeda and Taliban soldiers still roam the wild borderlands with Pakistan, that terrorists continue to issue threats. The job seems unfinished, and many say that bothers them.","2614":"'I think it is very sad that people would play upon the victims' families' emotions, or all Americans' emotions,' Mrs. Bush said, referring to the fury surrounding a warning that the president received in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning a hijacking. She added: 'I know my husband, and all Americans know how he has acted in Afghanistan and in the war with terror. I think, really, we need to put this in perspective, and I think it's sad to play upon the emotions of people as if there were something we could have done to stop it, because that's just not the case.'","2615":"But others in the administration, particularly some at the State Department, say an attack on Iraq would be seen as a confrontation with Islam worldwide, damaging Israeli-Palestinian peace prospects, bringing further unrest to the region and undermining support for battling Osama bin Laden and his network, Al Qaeda.","2616":"Senior government officials said Mr. Padilla had discussed the bomb plot with top Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan, among them Abu Zubaydah, the Osama bin Laden lieutenant who was captured in Pakistan in March and later told United States officials about the plan. But they also said Mr. Padilla had not obtained the materials to make such a device.","2617":"Today's disclosure may well galvanize Americans once again behind the president and the notion that the country remains at war, even as Congress moves ahead with its review of American intelligence failures that allowed Osama bin Laden and members of his Qaeda terrorist network to attack the country on Sept. 11.","2618":"Senior government officials have said Mr. Padilla, who was born in Brooklyn, discussed the bomb plot with Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan, among them Abu Zubaydah, the captured aide to Osama bin Laden who later told American officials about the bomb plan.","2619":"Senior government officials have said Mr. Padilla, who was born in Brooklyn, discussed the bomb plot with Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan, among them Abu Zubaydah, the captured aide to Osama bin Laden who later told American officials about the bomb plan.","2620":"Mr. Teaman, 45, said that he wished he could grab Osama bin Laden 'by the neck.' Instead, he grasped a perfectly honed chunk of grayish Fior de Pesco marble from a quarry in Italy. 'You know, there's a lot of pride here -- doing all this over again.'","2621":"Qatar was Mr. Rumsfeld's final stop in the gulf after visits to Kuwait and Bahrain. The capital, Doha, is home to Al Jazeera, the Arab-language satellite channel that has broadcast messages from Osama bin Laden and has been a frequent target of administration frustration.","2622":"WASHINGTON, June 12\u2014 Attorneys for victims of the 1998 bombings at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania filed a lawsuit against Osama bin Laden and 164 other named defendants today seeking $100 billion in damages.","2623":"It's bad enough that readily available encryption technology and fiber-optic cables often make N.S.A. techniques of interception obsolescent. Worse is that Osama bin Laden started substituting human messengers for cellphone calls four years ago.","2624":"Immediately after his session today with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mr. Rumsfeld was asked about claims, raised by senior Indian leaders, that Osama bin Laden's network had infiltrated into Kashmir.","2625":"The liberals thought they had the Islamic forces in Kuwait on the defensive after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The fact that one of Osama bin Laden's main spokesmen, Suleiman Abu Gheith, turned out to be a Kuwaiti further tarnished them. Kuwait has denied that another bin Laden lieutenant recently singled out by American intelligence is a Kuwaiti.","2626":"The Benevolence International Foundation, an Illinois-based charity active in Bosnia, has become a central focus of the inquiry into the finances of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. A1","2627":"SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2014 Benevolence International Foundation, an Illinois-based charity with broad activities in Bosnia, has emerged as a central focus of the investigation into the finances of Osama bin Laden and his Qaeda terrorist network.","2628":"To NBC's Tom Brokaw, who asked about the pace of the attack on Afghanistan, the square-jawed SecDef retorted, 'To hear your question and the urgency and 'Don't you need quick success?' -- my goodness gracious! go back to World War II.' (Brokaw has done very well going back to World War II.) This was using the phrase as a straight interjection. Rumsfeld also uses it in an adverbial form modifying an affirmative. Asked if he wanted Osama bin Laden dead, he answered, 'Oh, my goodness gracious, yes, after what he's done?' adding for emphasis, 'You bet your life.'","2629":"HOLY WAR, INC.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden, by Peter L. Bergen. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.) The author, a television journalist who interviewed Osama bin Laden for CNN in 1997, maintains that bin Laden's organization is a multinational holding company whose goal is changing America's Middle East policy. Last November our reviewer, Ethan Bronner, called this an 'engaging, well-written account' that successfully sorts through 'the hysteria and half-truths surrounding bin Laden.'","2630":"In November, Mr. Hassoun told The Herald that he had briefly worked for the magazine Call of Islam, which is published by the Islamic Youth Movement and advocates jihad and trains young people in guerrilla warfare, The Associated Press reported. The magazine has featured exclusive interviews with Osama bin Laden.","2631":"WASHINGTON\u2014 AMERICAN officials, riding high on their announcement that they had broken up a plot to detonate a 'dirty bomb' in the United States, said that they were helped by information from Abu Zubaydah, a former lieutenant to Osama bin Laden.","2632":"Mr. Tenet, whose tenure bridges the Clinton and Bush administrations, has a years-long overview of the American response to the terrorist threat and to Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's leader. In an appearance before the Senate intelligence committee last February, Mr. Tenet said he would welcome a review of the C.I.A.'s record. 'We have been at war with Al Qaeda for over five years,' he said.","2633":"But if Mr. Hanjour had apparently not yet come in contact with terrorist groups, the Tucson he visited in 1990 was already a well-established stop for Islamic militants. During the 1980's, their enemy had been the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan. Alkhifa, a group that recruited fighters and raised money for the jihad in Afghanistan, had one of its three American offices in Tucson. Federal authorities believe that by 1990, after the Soviets retreated from Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden had absorbed Alkhifa into Al Qaeda, his new terrorist organization.","2634":"It's ironic that the war of ideas that the West hoped would be fought in the Arab Muslim world after Sept. 11 -- a war against the Islamic fascism of Osama bin Laden that would be waged by Arabs offering a democratic, Islamic, progressive alternative -- has not happened, because there is not enough democracy in most places there for that war to even begin. But it is being fought in Iran -- not in response to Sept. 11 but in response to Iran's own bad experiences with secular despotism and religious despotism.","2635":"WASHINGTON, June 18\u2014 Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization began serious planning for a major attack inside the United States soon after it bombed two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998, top intelligence officials told a Congressional committee today.","2636":"Previously Saudi Arabia had said that scores of men rounded up on suspicion of sympathy to or membership in the group spawned by Osama bin Laden, himself a Saudi, had been cleared of any Qaeda connection. Indeed, press reports on Monday said the kingdom had released 160 men detained on their return from Afghanistan because they did not have any link to Al Qaeda.","2637":"The conversations were from Afghanistan, and at least one suspected Al Qaeda operative has been tentatively identified as a participant, officials said. Osama bin Laden was not involved in the intercepted discussions, they added. The existence of the intercepted messages was first reported today on CNN.","2638":"Mr. Darkazanli had ties to other associates of Osama bin Laden, including Wadih el-Hage, a Lebanese-born American who was Mr. bin Laden's personal secretary in Sudan.","2639":"He said that in 1998, an unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information led Osama bin Laden to stop using a satellite phone that the United States had been able to monitor. 'We never again heard from that satellite phone,' Mr. Fleischer said.","2640":"But there are also widespread fears in the expatriate community that the bombings, not all of which follow the same pattern, could be anti-Western attacks carried out either by Al Qaeda cells loyal to Osama bin Laden, who is Saudi-born, or by his sympathizers.","2641":"He claims the Pentagon was not hit by a plane, but by a guided missile fired on orders of far right-wingers inside the United States government. Further, he says, the planes that struck the World Trade Center were not flown by associates of Osama bin Laden, but were programmed by the same government people to fly into the twin towers.","2642":"In their theology classes, the students are taught to defend Islam against the infidels, Jews and Christians, and to strive to convert the infidels to their way of thinking. But the students are also heavily influenced by a cheap and strident anti-American mass-circulation magazine, Sabili, which characterizes Osama bin Laden as a hero.","2643":"At one point, Abu Sayyaf received money from a relative of Osama bin Laden, but beyond that its links to Al Qaeda were tenuous.","2644":"The principal difference between the narcotics trade and legitimate commerce, of course, is that the drug business must operate in the shadow of the law. This throws the entire organizational chart out of whack. Transportation becomes paramount, consolidation and vertical integration -- those cherished buzzwords of merger-hungry multinationals -- impossible. As a result, the narcotics industry has adapted what might be called the Osama bin Laden approach to management: base your operation in remote safe havens, the more war-torn and chaotic the better; stay small and shifty; use specialized subcontractors or freelancers on a need-to-know basis; vary your routes and routines whenever possible; and most important, always insulate yourself with plenty of expendable intermediaries in case someone gets caught and talks.","2645":"A spokesman for Al Qaeda claimed in an audio recording broadcast late yesterday from Qatar that the organization carried out the bloody April attack on a synagogue in Tunis and that the world would hear from Osama bin Laden soon.","2646":"He was in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan when the United States bombed it heavily in hopes of killing Osama bin Laden, officials said. His first wife, also Moroccan, died in the bombing, the officials said.","2647":"Though Mr. Bush's speech tilted heavily toward the view of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who has been arguing since September that Mr. Arafat is no different from Osama bin Laden, some Arab officials and Palestinians focused on the positive elements.","2648":"Some analysts said the government might not have wanted to sign a major deal welcoming in foreign oil companies at a time of open public hostility toward the United States, nor at a time of criticism by Osama bin Laden and his followers over the presence of foreign troops in the holy land of Islam.","2649":"Ground zero is now one of the most popular tourism attractions in the city. It is a place where tour guides charge $15 a head to point out the spot where the firefighters raised the flag. The proud can buy twin tower T-shirts, the angry can buy toilet paper bearing the face of Osama bin Laden and the curious can climb up the fence to take the perfect picture of what is now just a big hole. The hustle of commerce hawking to the crush of sightseers has prompted some to call it 9/11 World.","2650":"And now, faced with the evil of Osama bin Laden, they can no longer imagine there's 'nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too.'","2651":"More than 300 suspected members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban have been picked up in the area in recent months, officials said. Sen. Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in Washington this week that Osama bin Laden was probably in hiding somewhere Pakistan's tribal areas.","2652":"A search of their residence by the Rotterdam police produced some 60 passports, as well as videos of Osama bin Laden and information on land mines.","2653":"AL QAEDA -- Al Jazeera, the Arab-language satellite channel, broadcast an audiotape of a spokesman for Al Qaeda saying that Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were alive. The spokesman also said Al Qaeda was behind the fuel-tanker explosion at a Tunisian synagogue that killed 17 people. Al Jazeera said the recording came from a Kuwaiti journalist who downloaded it from two Internet sites.","2654":"You'll also find a United Nations of workers -- from 37 different countries, according to Joseph Vallone, the plant manager. There is also a makeshift memorial to Sept. 11 on a bulletin board in Annin's lunchroom. It includes the New York Post cover with the picture of Osama bin Laden and the headline, 'Wanted: Dead or Alive,' as well as a photograph of the Sopranos with the caption, 'Just tell us where bin Laden is and fuhgedaboudit.'","2655":"He also criticized the course of the war on terrorism. 'They haven't gotten Osama bin Laden or the Al Qaeda operation,' Mr. Gore said. 'They have refused to allow enough troops from the international community to be put into Afghanistan to keep it from sliding back under control of the warlords.'","2656":"Moderate Arabs still blame the United States for the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism as a political force in the 1970's, when they say American agents cultivated religious student movements on Arab campuses as counterweights to leftist groups. Similarly, Osama bin Laden and other senior Qaeda leaders honed their radical views and picked up weapons training while fighting on the American side in Afghanistan in the 80's.","2658":"In most other ways, though, 'Only in Israel' defies ready parallels. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States, while ultimately inspiring much ridicule of Osama bin Laden, created a climate in which political humor seemed inappropriate, if not unpatriotic. Jay Leno and David Letterman stopped hurling their nightly barbs at President Bush, while Bill Maher was assailed for having said on 'Politically Incorrect' that the hijackers were not cowards because they had willingly killed themselves. Even now, nearly 10 months after the World Trade Center attacks, a comedy routine mocking people's fears of tall buildings or airplanes would be anathema.","2659":"The same V.O.A. news department ignored our State Department's protest and provided a world broadcast platform to Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader harboring Osama bin Laden. Listeners the world over were informed by Omar on our network that 'America has created the evil that is attacking it' and should stop 'imposing its empire' on Islam.","2660":"Ten days ago, Suleiman Abu Gheith, a high-ranking operative of the Qaeda terrorist organization, popped up on Al Jazeera, the cable news channel in the Persian Gulf, to reinforce all the fears of Americans about impending terrorist attacks against the United States. In a confident and comfortable tone of voice, Mr. Abu Gheith assured the world that Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawhiri and Mullah Muhammad Omar are alive and well. On behalf of Al Qaeda, he happily claimed responsibility for the Sept. 11 attacks and the attack in April on a Jewish synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia. He added that the war against the United States was in just its beginning phases and that more attacks were to come.","2661":"The raids have been conducted at the behest of the Pentagon, which is convinced that the area, which falls largely outside the control of the central government, holds many fighters from Al Qaeda, and possibly even Osama bin Laden.","2663":"Family members were barraged with questions about whether the gunman might have been a Muslim fundamentalist who sympathized with Osama bin Laden and the Qaeda network, many of whose top figures are Egyptian.","2664":"Mr. Qadir was the governor of Nangarhar Province and a member of Hezb-i-Islami, a conservative political party from 1992 to 1994, The leader of that party, Yunis Khalis, gave Osama bin Laden refuge in 1994 when the Saudi national fled Sudan.","2665":"Mr. Qadir's long involvement in the cutthroat world of Afghan politics ensured that he had many enemies. He fought against the Taliban, but he belonged to a political party that once gave shelter to Osama bin Laden. As he emerged as the governor of Nangarhar province after the rout of the Taliban, he angered many of his rivals.","2666":"Federal investigators are conducting raids nationwide on jewelry stores owned mostly by Pakistanis, hoping to break up fronts for terrorist groups or their financial backers, officials said. The raids have taken place over the last two weeks in several cities, including New York, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. About 75 jewelry stores have been raided, a law enforcement official said. Tariq Hussain, 27, a recently discharged United States Army mechanic whose Intrigue Jewelers kiosk in suburban Pittsburgh was searched on June 26, said F.B.I. agents questioned him about connections to the Qaeda terrorist network or its leader, Osama bin Laden.","2667":"Mr. Bush also suggested that in the broader effort to prevent terrorism, he had slightly altered his approach toward the capture of Osama bin Laden, having said soon after the Sept. 11 attacks that it was his goal to take Mr. bin Laden 'dead or alive.'","2668":"One of the first signs of a large infusion of cash coming into the United States for use by the hijackers appears in bank records dating from 2000, when $100,000 was deposited in bank accounts controlled by some of the leading hijackers, including Mr. Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, Mr. Lormel said. The F.B.I. has traced that money back to the United Arab Emirates and believes that it was sent to the hijackers by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hisawi, who is accused of helping to manage Osama bin Laden's finances.","2669":"Mohamed Heidar Zammar, the German citizen now held in Syria, for instance, first came to the attention of American and German authorities in late 1998 during the investigation of Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who is considered a founder of Al Qaeda and suspected of being the financial chief for Osama bin Laden.","2670":"In this hourlong film, its reporter and producer, Gwynne Roberts, travels to Iraqi Kurdistan searching for links between Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden. He is accompanied by a doctor studying the long-term effects of poison gas on the towns and villages (more than 200 of them) attacked by Mr. Hussein in the late 1980's. The Hussein-Bin Laden connection is the more explosive subject. The claims are chilling if true, but while the evidence is convincing it remains unproved here. The effects of the poison gas, however, are viscerally, undeniably horrifying. On both counts the narrative and the images in 'Saddam's Ultimate Solution' are as gripping as any drama.","2671":"PARIS\u2014 Osama bin Laden is dead. The news first came from sources in Afghanistan and Pakistan almost six months ago: the fugitive died in December and was buried in the mountains of southeast Afghanistan. Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, echoed the information. The remnants of Osama's gang, however, have mostly stayed silent, either to keep Osama's ghost alive or because they have no means of communication.","2672":"Mention that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in attacking America were Saudis to almost any room full of people here, and denials still pour forth. There is no concrete evidence, people will argue, adding that even if Osama bin Laden, a native son, was somehow involved, he was led astray by his rabid Egyptian coterie.","2673":"In the background lurks a terrorist guru, Hilal (Jackie Schroff), modeled after Osama bin Laden. 'Extremists perform symbolic actions with the intention of causing a larger conflict,' said Vikram Chandra, a novelist who wrote the film. So it is with Hilal, who constantly cajoles Altaaf into committing violence that will play Hindu against Muslim.","2674":"Thanks to the shenanigans of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and the rest, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen further in the last three months than it did in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Think about it. The boardroom brethren have walloped the stock market harder than Osama bin Laden did.","2675":"A man suspected by the government of being an agent for Osama bin Laden pleaded guilty this week to illegally entering the United States in June 2001, federal authorities said yesterday.","2676":"WASHINGTON\u2014 In the course of 24 hours last week President Bush gave a major speech calling for business reforms that will 'usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America' and held a press conference that dealt more with Mr. Bush's conduct when he was a Harken Energy board member than with the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives was grilling former and current WorldCom executives about accounting irregularities, and senators were voting unanimously to support tough new corporate-reform legislation.","2677":"The current scandal is the penalty for this inconsistent vigilance. It is now clear that Cardinal Law was not alone among the bishops in his insensitive and often dismissive response to victims' complaints, and in his reluctance and occasional refusal to remove even multiply accused priests like John Geoghan and Paul Shanley from active ministry. Disclosures of similar episcopal behavior in other dioceses made 'the crisis in the Catholic Church' the biggest story involving religion in years -- and that's saying something in the days of Osama bin Laden and Islamic extremism.","2680":"Second, the Lindh plea shows the hazard of overpromising the public on what federal prosecutors can deliver. While the Bush administration is exceptionally secretive about much that should be public in this war on terrorism (for example, what happened to all the people held in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11), it has been too vocal in trumpeting the likely outcome of pending legal cases. Public statements by Attorney General John Ashcroft that Mr. Lindh had met with Osama bin Laden are hard to explain when the defendant is allowed to plead to charges that do not relate to terrorism. Winning a legal case is never as straightforward as winning a debating point on a cable television show. The success of our efforts against terrorism will be measured, in time, by how well we and our allies carry out law enforcement efforts. Prudence and probity are essential.","2682":"F.B.I. officials said the bureau believed that the transfers were sent by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hisawi, who has been identified as a financial manager for Osama bin Laden. Mr. Hisawi is widely believed to have fled to Pakistan before Sept. 11, but only after receiving unused cash back from the hijackers.","2683":"The Spanish group has been linked to Osama bin Laden's operations in Europe and Afghanistan, and specifically to the Qaeda cell in Germany that produced three of the hijackers who led the Sept. 11 attacks.","2684":"Without informers in or near the group's leadership, the C.I.A. was unable to provide specific warnings of the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. The subcommittee chairman, Representative Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said the C.I.A. failed to get any informers close enough to Osama bin Laden to learn his plans.","2685":"Zacarias Moussaoui tried to plead guilty to conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks, and he admitted in court that he was a member of the Qaeda network, had joined in plans for terrorist acts and was loyal to Osama bin Laden. But a federal judge refused to accept the surprise plea and urged Mr. Moussaoui, who is representing himself, to take a week to reconsider. A1","2686":"ALEXANDRIA, Va., July 18\u2014 Zacarias Moussaoui tried today to plead guilty to conspiring in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and acknowledged in court that he was a member of the Qaeda network, had joined in plans for terrorist acts and was loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2687":"Government officials say they have no direct evidence that Mr. Moussaoui had a role in the hijackings. From the beginning the evidence has been circumstantial. Now, some government officials, in interviews, are saying that prosecutors overreached when they charged that Mr. Moussaoui was a direct participant with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda in the conspiracy to kill thousands of people on Sept. 11.","2688":"After Sept. 11, however, Manhattan acquired a terrible new symbolism, and economic uncertainty has taken a toll on hedonism, at least of the expense-account kind. Osama bin Laden has outpaced Monica Lewinsky by 17 to 1 in the pages of The New York Times over the last year. Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays Carrie Bradshaw, the newspaper writer whose column tracks her adventures in dating, is pregnant in real life. Kim Cattrall, who plays the public relations vamp, Samantha, published a sex manual with her husband this year -- in which she confessed that she didn't enjoy her 20 years of sex before meeting him. And earlier this month, Candace Bushnell, the sleek blonde writer whose libidinous columns in The New York Observer and subsequent book spawned 'Sex and the City,' got married, at 43 (to a man 10 years younger than she, but still, married).","2689":"In the House of Commons, Mr. Blair said that Britain has gathered extensive evidence that 'Saddam Hussein is still trying to develop weapons of mass destruction' and that Britain will publish the evidence 'at the appropriate time.' Last fall, the British government published the first detailed report that Osama bin Laden was directly linked to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, thus laying down an important predicate for the war in Afghanistan.","2690":"The Abu Sayyaf group has operated in the Philippines since the early 1990's. Initially it demanded an Islamic state in the south, but degenerated into what Philippine military commanders describe as bandits. At one point, Abu Sayyaf received money from a relative of Osama bin Laden, but beyond that, any possible links to Al Qaeda are uncertain.","2691":"'There's a handful of C.E.O.'s that have done more to hurt our economy than Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda combined, and I have absolutely no sympathy for any of them,' Mr. D'Alessandro said. 'All the C.E.O.'s I talk to share the same viewpoint.'","2692":"The turnaround by Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen who has admitted that he is a member of the Qaeda terrorist network and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, came when he balked at a federal judge's ruling that a guilty plea would require him to confess to detailed involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy.","2694":"Mr. Moussaoui acknowledged in federal court that he was a member of Al Qaeda, the terrorist network set up by Osama bin Laden, and suggested he was sent to the United States to participate in a terrorist conspiracy. But Mr. Moussaoui said at a hearing on Thursday that while he might have associated with some of the hijackers, 'it doesn't mean that I'm on the plane' with them.","2696":"WASHINGTON, July 30\u2014 Some of Osama bin Laden's personal bodyguards have been apprehended and are now being held at the American military base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, government officials said today.","2697":"'I think there were serious errors,' Mr. Kerry said in an interview, referring to the American ground campaign in Afghanistan that he contends probably allowed Osama bin Laden to slip into Pakistan. He made the point again on Monday as he joined other potential presidential candidates in speaking to centrist Democrats in New York.","2698":"Mr. Hussein has been condemned as a Muslim apostate by Islamic militant leaders, including Osama bin Laden, but Kurdish officials say religious politics mean little to the Iraqi ruler when he sees an opportunity to strike his enemies.","2699":"In my opinion, no. I would say that the majority of people who commit acts of terrorism are doing it because of a twisted way of thinking that it's the only tool they have. I have heard people call Osama bin Laden a megalomaniac. Not to defend the guy, but I don't think his personal desires play into it. He thinks he's doing something for a cause. I don't think that he's trying to make a name for himself.","2700":"Mr. Moussaoui has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden. But he has insisted that he was not involved in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. On the day of the attacks, Mr. Moussaoui was in a Minnesota prison cell; he was arrested in August after raising suspicions among instructors at a flight school he was attending near Minneapolis .","2701":"He was arrested two weeks later. At the time of his arrest, the police raided his apartment in southeast London and found a laptop computer containing articles about Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.","2703":"Administration officials in Washington said that the intelligence report from the foreign government, which they declined to identify, was the second report that the administration had received in recent months about possible plans to attack major monuments in the United States. The first came from Abu Zubaydah, a senior aide to Osama bin Laden, who last spring told American officials of plans to strike the bridge in the 'Godzilla' movie.","2704":"Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen, is charged with conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks. Although he has acknowledged that he is a member of the Qaeda terrorist network and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. He was in jail in Minnesota on the day of the attacks, under arrest for visa violations after arousing the suspicion of instructors at a flight school near Minneapolis.","2705":"The president spoke to the nation's chief executives in the same terms he has reserved for Osama bin Laden: 'If you break the law, we will hunt you down, we will arrest you, and we will prosecute you.' But Mr. Bush said that the good news for the economy is that the 'vast majority of C.E.O.'s are good, honorable people' who 'care deeply about their shareholders and their employees.'","2706":"WASHINGTON, Aug. 14\u2014 More than 300 family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks are preparing to file suit against various 'interests' associated with the government of Saudi Arabia, alleging that they helped finance Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, a Washington lawyer representing the families said today.","2707":"In a rare public appearance last month, Mr. Watson said at a law enforcement conference that he believed Osama bin Laden was dead. 'I personally think he is probably not with us anymore, but I have no evidence to support that,' he said.","2708":"And what does the administration propose as a solution? Last week John Ashcroft went on TV to announce what he calls the 'first ever White House conference on missing and exploited children.' It takes an exploiter to know one. F.B.I. figures show a decline in the kidnapping of children -- except on cable TV. But if you can't crack the anthrax case, why not create some distracting hysteria by glomming onto a local law enforcement issue that is the biggest showbiz phenomenon since shark attacks? The administration loves the bait-and-switch. It hyped the cases of 'the American Taliban,' John Walker Lindh, and the 'dirty bomber,' Jose Padilla, to cover for its failure to snare the actual Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and the actual bomber, Osama bin Laden, much as it has hyped the perp walks of second-rung executives from WorldCom to make us forget about Halliburton, Harken and Ken Lay.","2709":"In new allegations, prosecutors say agents searching Mr. Marri's apartment found an almanac in which business cards were used to bookmark pages describing major dams, reservoirs, and car and railroad tunnels. The agents say they also found a file on Mr. Marri's computer that showed a picture of Osama bin Laden and played a recorded prayer that praises Mr. bin Laden and makes implicit threats against Americans.","2710":"The archive includes instruction tapes on bomb-making and on how to shoot surface-to-air weapons, as well as the first meeting of Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders with foreign journalists in May 1998, and other tapes -- often violent -- contributed by affiliated groups in Bosnia, Chechnya, Somalia, Sudan and elsewhere.","2711":"To be fair, Florida State is not the only entity to use words or images from the ghastly national tragedy. Outside the ballpark in Pittsburgh, when baseball resumed last September, a vendor was selling T-shirts that bawdily mocked Osama bin Laden. Athletes have worn NYPD and FDNY caps in games. Bruce Springsteen issued songs on the theme, and Neil Young wrote one called 'Let's Roll.'","2712":"CNN says it paid about $30,000 for the videotapes of Osama bin Laden and operatives of Al Qaeda that it has been showing. CNN executives and Nic Robertson, the correspondent who obtained the tapes, had previously indicated that the network did not pay for them. The network blamed the erroneous contention on miscommunication and its attempts to protect its reporters overseas. [A8.]","2713":"CNN said yesterday that it paid about $30,000 to people in Afghanistan for the videotapes of Osama bin Laden and operatives of Al Qaeda it has been showing this week.","2715":"Raw intelligence reports cannot be published without compromising confidential sources and methods. But the basic intelligence evidence that underlies critical national decisions can and must be made public. Past administrations have done that repeatedly, for example, by displaying spy-plane photos of Russian missiles in Cuba in 1962 or releasing cockpit-to-tower conversations recorded during Moscow's downing of a Korean passenger jet in 1983. Before last fall's airstrikes in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain presented a compendium of intelligence findings linking Osama bin Laden and the Taliban to the Sept. 11 attacks. If Mr. Bush means to propose launching a preventive war against Iraq, he must do no less.","2716":"But Mr. Gymnastiar is not afraid to say he has yet to see enough proof that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. 'There has to be to be a visible trial,' he said.","2717":"Seated cross-legged on concrete cell floors, the men, most of them Pakistanis, profess a blithe ignorance of the basics of warfare, much less terrorism. The Kalashnikov rifle, the ubiquitous weapon of Islamic militancy? Not one of the prisoners admits to ever having handled one. Osama bin Laden? Not a man among them acknowledges any thoughts about him, good or bad. Sept. 11? Something they know little about, other than that many people died.","2718":"The Seattle Times has reported that investigators believe that Mr. Ujaama and two members of the London mosque of Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri, a radical clergyman who is suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden, visited a farm in Bly, Ore., to try to set up a Qaeda training camp in 1999.","2719":"The main thing is, I got a 20-year-old son, and he's doing great now, but he's been kind of a hard dog to keep under the porch at times, kind of like I was at 20. Also, I get naturally suspicious when politicians start agreeing with each other as much as they were following Sept. 11. It just occurred to me that we were going to get this kid because we couldn't come up with a body that we could say was Osama bin Laden.","2720":"The new prospect of America becoming less American -- less open and accepting, in particular -- is tremendously saddening. It appears now that younger Arabs will not have the same opportunity I had. All the security checks and resurgent stereotyping will decrease the number of Arabs visiting the United States and studying in its colleges. For the time being, then, Osama bin Laden has a victory: a worsening of relations, perhaps true enmity between two cultures.","2721":"In trying to understand his dangerous new assignment, which will include a military operation to kill Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden as they meet in Iraq to plot evil, the fictional Newman reaches out to the real-life North.","2722":"ASADABAD, Afghanistan, Aug. 23\u2014 After months of frustration, American commanders appear to have concluded that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive and moving between mountain hideouts somewhere on a 250-mile stretch of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.","2723":"Wrong, says Daniel Pipes in this anthology of random pieces going back to 1990. That Tuesday from hell was not the beginning, let alone the end of history. Nor should the hijackers, their shadowy handlers and Osama bin Laden be taken for the authentic voice of Islam, the religion and civilization, with 1.3 billion adherents and nearly 1,400 years of history. On the contrary, says Mr. Pipes. What hit us on Sept. 11 was Islamism, the ideology, a product of relatively recent civilizational discontents in a swath of the world where a glorious past has somehow led to a futureless present.","2724":"American commanders, after months of frustration, appear to have concluded that Osama bin Laden is probably still alive and moving between mountain hideouts somewhere on a 250-mile stretch of the 1,400-mile border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. A1","2726":"Why? Because it exhibits such profound lack of understanding of what America is about, and it exhibits such a chilling mimicry of what the most repressive Arab Muslim states are about. Ask yourself this question: What would Osama bin Laden do if he found out that the University of Riyadh had asked incoming freshmen to read the New and Old Testaments?","2727":"At the same time many of the more serious 9/11 books try to subject the chaos and fear of that seismic day to the ordering, sense-making mechanics of narrative. In compressing a mass of incidents, images and evidence -- material already familiar to us from the media coverage the events received (in sharp contrast to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which did not immediately interrupt regular programming on many radio stations) -- many books create story lines that play to the public's perceived need for closure. These books consciously or unconsciously accentuate the positive, following a therapeutic arc that underscores the nation's movement from shock and horror, through grief and mourning, toward patriotic solidarity and resolve, never mind that Osama bin Laden has yet to be found, Al Qaeda remains a threat, and the war on terrorism rumbles on with no end in sight.","2728":"It was May 1998, long before Afghanistan became the Times Square of journalism after last year's war, and Mr. Miller had an appointment with Osama bin Laden. 'We are not women,' Ali said with indignation. 'We will not wear veils. We will walk, as men.' A few minutes later, Mr. Miller, incongruously wearing Afghan garments, Armani glasses and white socks, crossed over Pakistan's northern border and began walking toward the high peaks of eastern Afghanistan.","2729":"With this global context solidly established, Mr. Bernstein begins cross cutting in time and place, alternating minibiographies of emergent Al Qaeda leaders like Osama bin Laden (a close follower of Azzam), with portraits of their victims (police, firefighters, Trade Center workers), tracking them as they swept toward a rendezvous with disaster. The climactic chapter returns to the scene of the crime, describing the bloody denouement with a combination of compassion and precision.","2730":"If Osama bin Laden is alive, then President Bush is playing into his hands by planning to invade Iraq. The Qaeda leader has wasted his life trying, unsuccessfully, to unite the Muslim world against the United States. Now Mr. Bush is planning to give him his wish -- not only hatred from the Muslim world, but the enmity of the entire civilized world. And for what purpose? To prove that he can do it?","2731":"The draft United Nations report cites unidentified experts and government sources in asserting financial operatives are still managing at least $30 million on behalf of Osama bin Laden and his organization.","2732":"Of course we still remember the missing, and mourn them, and not even a maudlin, self-aggrandizing media orgy a year later could so deaden our senses that we would forget. But a certain national numbness, or perhaps amnesia, is settling in. If we remember the dead of Sept. 11 vividly, we are gradually losing sight of those who carried out their slaughter. Wasn't our mission to track down Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, dead or alive, before they struck again? We are now gearing up to fight another war that has been grandfathered into the war on terrorism. While it too targets an unambiguous evildoer, it is a different mission that is already obscuring the first and may yet defeat it.","2733":"A front-page article on Wednesday about the search for Osama bin Laden misstated the location of the Shah-i-Kot Valley, the site of the biggest American ground battle in the war to oust the Taliban. It is 100 miles south of Kabul, not southwest.","2734":"He was identified as belonging to a group of about 20 Muslims on board the plane that was heading for a conference in Birmingham, England, arranged by a Muslim sect known as Salafists. The sect describes itself as a purist strand of the Islamic faith. Its spokesman in Birmingham, Abu Khadeejah, said the conference organizers did not know Mr. Chatty. He also said the Salafists reject terrorism and had condemned both Osama bin Laden and the attacks last Sept. 11.","2735":"Osama bin Laden presented himself as having acted on behalf of Arab honor and Islamic doctrine. The attacks set off both official and vigilante responses in America, ranging from the detention of several thousand Arab suspects to the vandalism of mosques and the beating of Arabs and South Asians. Islam has been assailed as an intrinsically violent faith. The University of North Carolina was criticized by politicians for assigning incoming students to read a book about the Koran.","2736":"The Seattle Times has reported that investigators believe that Mr. Kassir and a member of the London mosque of Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri, a radical cleric who is believed to have contact with Osama bin Laden, tried to set up the camp in Oregon, along with James Ujaama. Mr. Ujaama has been held since July 22 as a material witness for a grand jury in Virginia that is investigating Sheik Masri; on Wednesday, Mr. Ujaama was indicted.","2738":"No one was seriously injured in the incident outside the Tandoori Cottage Restaurant in Selden, N.Y., late Saturday, but investigators quoted Mehmooda Malik, 37, and her son, Gibbran, as saying the attackers and other youths confronted them with anti-Muslim profanities and shouts of 'Are you terrorists?' 'You blew up the twin towers!' and 'Are you connected to Osama bin Laden?'","2739":"Commanders in the American military's most elite Special Operations unit are arguing that their troops should be freed from a fruitless hunt in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, military and intelligence officials say. Some senior officers in the Joint Special Operations Command have concluded that Mr. bin Laden is dead, though they lack hard evidence, officials said. Other military and intelligence officials have sharply disagreed with their assessment. A1","2740":"PARIS, Sept. 2\u2014 With growing evidence of militant Islamic activities in the Netherlands, Dutch prosecutors charged eight men today with helping to recruit, house and finance fighters for the Qaeda network headed by Osama bin Laden.","2741":"A week after he occupied newspaper headlines and a segment on the 'Today' show to ventilate his dispute with another comedian, JACKIE MASON is in forward-looking mode, anticipating his next one-man Broadway show, 'Prune Danish,' and its barbs at the expense of both Osama bin Laden and President Bush.","2742":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 2\u2014 Commanders in the American military's most elite Special Operations unit are contending that their troops should be freed from the fruitless hunt in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden, military and intelligence officials say.","2743":"It seems ridiculous to me for President Bush to advocate war against Iraq when the United States military hasn't even been able to capture or kill Osama bin Laden ('Administration Seeking to Build Support in Congress on Iraq Issue,' front page, Aug. 30).","2744":"Instead, the program uses Mr. Bush's words as a springboard to consider what evil might be. A professor of theology says that you can call Osama bin Laden 'the personification of evil,' but 'even if you say that, evil is bigger.'","2745":"But it was his connection with Raed Hijazi, who was convicted in Jordan of plotting to blow up tourist sites on the eve of the millennium, that focused interest. Mr. Hijazi was reported to have accused Mr. Marabh of being an agent of Osama bin Laden.","2746":"The war against Osama bin Laden is not finished, he said. 'My concern,' he said, 'is that we have not even begun to achieve in Afghanistan anything that could be called nation-building.'","2747":"A reputed top aide to Osama bin Laden who has pleaded guilty to stabbing a jail guard in New York testified yesterday that he wanted to break out and go to the United Nations to proclaim his innocence.","2748":"Twelve short months ago, President Bush proclaimed that he wanted Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.' Yet now -- after nearly a year of dogged searching -- Mr. Bush's Special Operations commanders in Afghanistan find the search for the terrorist leader fruitless and want to give up (front page, Sept. 3).","2749":"In an unrelated case, Dutch prosecutors charged eight foreigners with helping to recruit and finance fighters for the Qaeda network headed by Osama bin Laden. Dutch security police said the group had sought combatants for the international holy war.","2751":"The suit, brought by the firm Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, names as defendants Iraq, the Iraqi intelligence agency, Saddam Hussein and his sons, Al Qaeda Islamic Army, Osama bin Laden, the estates of the hijackers, the Taliban and organizations that provided money for the attacks.","2752":"'The Axis of Evil is North Korea, Iraq and Iran,' he wrote this time, painting over the original statements. 'Osama bin Laden is the top terrorist. George W. Bush is a good leader. And Iceland is not a banana republic.'","2753":"Officials denied a resident Turkish couple's request to name their newborn Osama bin Laden. German regulations require that children's names not be offensive -- the name Hitler is banned -- and that the names of foreign families' children be acceptable in their countries of origin. Registration officials in Cologne, where the couple lives, said they had rejected the name because it would not be allowed in Turkey and because of its association with the Sept. 11 attacks. The matter has been sent to a judge, who will have final say.","2754":"An article yesterday about a survivors' lawsuit filed in Manhattan charging the Iraqi government with complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks gave a misspelled surname in some copies for an Iraqi columnist who reported in July 2001 that Osama bin Laden was making plans to 'demolish the Pentagon after he destroys the White House.' The columnist is Naeem Abd Muhalhal, not Mulhalhal.","2756":"A reputed senior aide to Osama bin Laden admitted in federal court that he devised a plan to take hostages in an effort to win freedom for himself and four other New York inmates. A7","2757":"A reputed senior aide to Osama bin Laden who has been jailed in New York since 1998 admitted in federal court yesterday that he planned two years ago to take hostages in a bid to win freedom for himself and other terrorism suspects at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.","2758":"The man, 25, had a picture of Osama bin Laden in the apartment, near Heidelberg, along with Islamic literature and a book about building bombs, said Thomas Sch\u00e4uble, the chief prosecutor for the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The arrested woman, a 23-year-old who held joint German and American citizenship, worked at a supermarket for American military personnel and dependents at the military base in Heidelberg, the prosecutor said.","2759":"What some members of Congress have called the greatest failure in American intelligence since Pearl Harbor was also a failure to recognize an open and determined enemy. Osama bin Laden announced publicly that he was going to smite the empire. He assured Americans that he had motive, means and opportunity.","2760":"During the cold war, eavesdropping on unencrypted Russian communications was a relatively simple task since the Soviet military was easy to locate and they communicated endlessly over known communications channels. But in the post-9/11 world, the N.S.A. is faced with the flip side of the coin. Members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups operate in small cells hidden throughout the world, communicate infrequently and often with untraceable phone cards over random pay phones. E-mail messages are sent using anonymous computers, servers and screen names in libraries, copy shops or other public places. It is little surprise, therefore, that the last time the N.S.A. was able to eavesdrop on Osama bin Laden was in 1998, three years before the attacks.","2761":"But many Afghans say Al Qaeda plotted to kill Mr. Massoud to deprive Afghanistan of its most renowned military commander ahead of the American onslaught that ensued after Sept. 11. According to this theory, Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, may have reasoned that without Mr. Massoud the Northern Alliance forces he led would disintegrate, denying the United States the ready ally it found in the alliance.","2763":"Rick Rescorla and Dan Hill, the long-ago soldiers and longtime comrades at the center of James B. Stewart's new book, thought like Norsemen. In 1998, when Osama bin Laden was blamed for the bombing of two American embassies in Africa, Hill hatched a plan to assassinate him. Although Hill and the Army had parted unhappily more than 20 years earlier, he was still a patriot. (And there was a reported $15 million bounty to consider.) Rescorla warned him that he might kill bin Laden but he'd probably be killed himself. 'I'm not risking that much,' Hill replied. 'Anyway, it's better than being an old man.' Hill's assassination plan didn't work out. A few years later, in the spring of 2001, he and Rescorla were reminiscing about the Vietnam War, from which Rescorla in particular had emerged a hero. By now Rescorla was director of security for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Manhattan, and was being treated for prostate cancer. 'Men like us shouldn't go out like this. We're supposed to die in some desperate battle performing great deeds.'","2765":"The police found 287 pounds of chemicals, five pipe bombs, and a picture of Osama bin Laden in the apartment, and immediately arrested the couple, on suspicion of plotting an attack on the American military at Heidelberg.","2767":"Now the good news. To begin with, Friedman is more often right than not. He was profoundly right in saying that Sept. 11 was an appalling crime that had no conceivable justification, or even any real origin in oppression and injustice. That might not sound like such an amazing insight, but it quite eluded the 'America had it coming' left in Europe and on some campuses in the United States. As Friedman saw, Osama bin Laden was not the brave if misguided proponent of a worthy cause, and he didn't care twopence for the Palestinians. He was -- let's hope the past tense is correct -- a bloodthirsty religious maniac, and his followers were deluded fanatics for whom murder was some obscure compensation for failure.","2768":"Capturing or killing Osama bin Laden remains a benchmark of sorts for success in Afghanistan. Three-quarters of the poll's respondents said they think he is still alive; 61 percent said the United States will not have won the war in Afghanistan unless he is captured or killed.","2769":"Such preparation and attention to detail is the heart of Al Qaeda's tradecraft. Members of the organization began photographing the United States Embassy in Nairobi in 1993, five years before it was bombed, says Peter L. Bergen, author of 'Holy War Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden' (Free Press, 2001). Planning for the Sept. 11 attacks began at least two years before the hijackings.","2770":"On the first anniversary of Sept. 11, many of the Islamic operatives who enlisted in the holy war on America are dead or in jail, but signs are that Al Qaeda is very much alive and hankering for another hit. Thus the unease of millions of ordinary Americans, and the undoubted chagrin of President Bush, who hasn't had much to say about Osama bin Laden since issuing his swaggering 'Wanted: Dead or Alive' declaration last year. Whatever the elusive bin Laden's current status, security officials are proceeding on the assumption that the question is not if, but when, his determined minions will strike again.","2771":"The final two shorts are by Idrissa Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso and Shohei Imamura of Japan. Mr. Ouedraogo has five boys imagining they could win a $25 million reward for capturing Osama bin Laden. Mr. Imamura follows a World War II veteran who thinks he is a snake after witnessing the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The veteran director ends his short with the words: 'There is no holy war.'","2772":"On Nov. 29, 1999, a 31-year-old architecture student in Germany named Mohamed Atta, unknown to the world but already determined to strike an unforgettable blow against those he believed to be his enemies, boarded Turkish Airlines Flight 1662 from Istanbul to Karachi, Pakistan. Mr. Atta took at least a couple of days to reach his final destination: a training camp in Afghanistan run by Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's sprawling international terrorist organization.","2773":"A reputed senior aide to Osama bin Laden who pleaded guilty to stabbing a jail guard testified yesterday that he lied to his lawyer when he told him he had carried out the attack, in November 2000, in an attempt to escape from a jail in Lower Manhattan.","2774":"Both broadcasts involved only snippets of the exclusive material, but they could provide the most direct linkage yet made public between the attacks and Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. The interviews come in the wake of similar tapes broadcast by Al Jazeera. The source of the material could not be independently confirmed.","2777":"'For those of us who survived, we are not going to live each day in fear or have him destroy our spirit or finish the ugly job he started,' Mr. Dunne said, referring to Osama bin Laden. 'We are going to do just the opposite: honor the people lost and work as hard as we can to rebuild what they tried to destroy.'","2778":"Q. One of the things I remember, the question that stood out to me this year was by Senator Pat Roberts in February at an open hearing with Tenet -- I don't know if you remember the question. He said, you know, 'When I go back to Dodge City, Kan., and talk to the kaffeeklatsch, people are saying, asking me if John Walker Lindh could get in to see Osama bin Laden, why couldn't the C.I.A.?'","2779":"American investigators trying to reconstruct the Sept. 11 hijacking plot have found evidence of a 1999 meeting between the leader of the plot, Mohamed Atta, and Osama bin Laden. A1","2780":"'Management books talk about learning organizations,' said one American intelligence official. Osama bin Laden, the official said, 'built something that is a learning organization. It is changing and adapting to the loss of its infrastructure.'","2781":"The organization has links to Al Qaeda, having received money from Osama bin Laden and having sent many of its members -- including Mr. Faruq -- to Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, Western and Asian intelligence officials said. They stress, however, that Jemaah Islamiyah has its own regional agenda and acts on its own. Officials said today that there was no evidence that Mr. bin Laden, if he is still alive, or any of his lieutenants had been behind the plot that led to the embassy closings.","2782":"But Osama bin Laden remains unaccounted for, a dangerous mind bent against the West, able to transport that danger, as if by Internet or other invisible circuits, home to Americans. So the war in Afghanistan on the slopes of Tora Bora or Khost is only part of it. The rest is here.","2783":"A man reputed to have been a senior aide to Osama bin Laden testified yesterday that he never wanted to stab a guard in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in November 2000, but that he did so anyway because he felt it would be the only way to seize his keys.","2784":"In Dallas, Ken Goldberg, who runs the DFW Gun Range, says he has noticed a softening of the pain over time: there has been a decided drop in his customers' once-raging demand for Osama bin Laden paper targets to shred with gunfire.","2785":"At first, Mr. Bush was ferocious, spitting cowboy threats about getting Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar 'dead or alive.'","2786":"With so much language from the Old West, it's not surprising that some people worried Mr. Bush would shoot first and ask questions later. Mr. Pelley points out that some in the Pentagon were concerned that the president might immediately launch missiles toward Osama bin Laden, a tactic that had failed before. Mr. Bush seems amused and says offhandedly, 'There's a lot of Nervous Nellies at the Pentagon anyway, a lot of people like to chatter.'","2787":"And no president preparing to make the case for war in Iraq -- a war about which the Congress and nation still have questions -- could afford to be surprised by another devastating blow from Osama bin Laden, the elusive terrorist leader who it is believed to have ordered the strikes against the United States a year ago.","2788":"THE CASE: Mr. Bush names Osama bin Laden as the chief suspect and declares he's wanted dead or alive. The President also orders the freeze of all domestic assets of 278 groups with ties to terror organizations.","2789":"Now Mr. Bush seems determined to transform Sept. 11 into a milestone on the road to war with Iraq, and to use last year's attack by Osama bin Laden and the continued threat from Al Qaeda to justify this year's pursuit of Saddam Hussein. Clearly, the two are not yet linked in the minds of many Americans and most of America's allies. Before today's threat, polls showed Americans largely out of sync with the president, more worried about a jobless recovery than terrorism. But over the past year, the linkage in the president's mind between Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Hussein has grown tighter -- and given birth to a new policy of pre-emption that encapsulates Mr. Bush's view that the United States must strike before it is struck again.","2790":"The raid today followed the discovery last week of what officials said was a plot to blow up a store on an American military base in Heidelberg. A German-born Turk and his girlfriend, a German-American woman who worked at the store, were arrested on suspicion of planning a bombing attack on or around Sept. 11. They had a photo of Osama bin Laden in their apartment and about 300 pounds of explosive chemicals. The Germans have praised the quick police action in Heidelberg, but, in fact, the tipoff came from American authorities, after a friend of the woman reported a warning to the military police.","2791":"At a local bookshop, three sales clerks were sipping tea. Their books were mostly on politics and literature, including a translation into Arabic of 'The Tin Drum' by G\u00fcnter Grass, and the works of a Moroccan novelist, Mohammed Shukri. A new book called 'The First War of the 21st Century,' featuring pictures of Osama bin Laden and President Bush on the cover, was attracting some attention, although the $4 price was stiff, they said.","2792":"One senior administration official who has been giving advance warning of the message to governments around the world said Mr. Bush 'won't set any deadlines,' nor will he propose a specific course of action. But just as the president told Congress last Sept. 20 that he was not willing to wait very long for the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden, the official said, 'he's not willing to wait very long for Saddam to allow the destruction of his weapons.'","2793":"Your Sept. 11 editorial, 'America Enduring,' was strangely reticent about those who perpetrated the evil that day last year. You did not mention that Osama bin Laden, for all we know, is still at large. And that with him are thousands of others like him.","2794":"In Afghanistan, he indicated that the hunt for Osama bin Laden might not be as important as strengthening government control over the countryside. 'My hunch is that more chances are that he is dead,' he said.","2795":"Q -- You are a prominent member of the antiterror coalition. Tell us what you can today about where Osama bin Laden is, whether you think he's dead or alive and how long the hunt for him is going to go on?","2796":"President Bush has formally changed the face of America's primary enemy from Osama bin Laden, whereabouts unknown, to Saddam Hussein, an old nemesis who cheated both Mr. Bush's father and President Clinton out of fulfillment of the terms of surrender that ended the 1991 Persian Gulf war.","2797":"In his speech, the president turned his campaign in a new direction, making no mention of Osama bin Laden or of nations his administration has identified as threats, like Iran and North Korea. He made only a passing reference to Al Qaeda.","2798":"LONDON, Sept. 12\u2014 Even as much of Britain mourned America's loss and its own on Sept. 11, Muslim leaders known here as supporters of holy war seized on the moment of grief to hail Osama bin Laden as a hero and to evoke the 'positive outcomes' of the attacks in New York and Washington.","2800":"The Chinese report condemns a host of groups: an East Turkestan Liberation Organization; a 'Shock Brigade' of the Islamic Reformist Party; an East Turkestan Islamic Party; an East Turkestan Opposition Party; an East Turkestan Islamic Party of Allah; a Uighur Liberation Organization; the Islamic Holy Warriors; and an East Turkestan International Committee. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement does receive special mention for its purported close links to Osama bin Laden and for allegedly sending trained agents and weapons into Xinjiang in 1998.","2801":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 13\u2014 A federal judge in Chicago today threw out a perjury indictment against an Islamic charity and its leader, who were accused of lying about ties to Osama bin Laden and whether they had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.","2802":"Mr. Khadr's 20-year-old brother, Abdul Rahman, who was born in Bahrain, was seized by Northern Alliance forces, the United States' allies, while fighting with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in November. Their father, Ahmed Said Khadr, an Egyptian-born Canadian citizen considered by Canadian intelligence officials to be a close associate of Osama bin Laden, is believed to be hiding in Pakistan or Afghanistan.","2803":"Last April, NRK traced Mr. Ahmad to Bierra, in northern Iraq, where he praised Osama bin Laden in an interview. He urged Norway not to back the United States in upcoming conflicts 'so that it won't suffer later.'","2804":"Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen who is acting as his own lawyer, has acknowledged his membership in the Qaeda terrorist network and his loyalty to Osama bin Laden. But he has denied any involvement in the Sept. 11 conspiracy. On the day of the attacks, he was in a Minnesota jail cell on immigration charges after arousing suspicion among instructors at a local flight school.","2805":"Osama bin Laden and his senior aides made no secret of their desire to buy or develop unconventional weapons. Testimony in terrorism trials in New York and other cities indicated that Al Qaeda was actively seeking nuclear and other unconventional weapons even in the early 1990's. Mr. bin Laden indicated that he considered the acquisition of such weapons a religious duty.","2807":"A mostly impoverished Muslim nation of 17 million people that borders Saudi Arabia, Yemen has proved a fertile recruiting ground for Osama bin Laden's terrorist network. On Friday, American officials confirmed the capture in Pakistan of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni who, officials said, served as a paymaster for the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks.","2808":"But what may be a rhetorical necessity for presidents is hardly a useful concept for policy makers. Terrorists come in many forms. Distinctions must be made, priorities set -- and America's priority is not with the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka or the Basque E.T.A. of Spain or the Shining Path of Peru. The terrorist enemies of the current conflict are the radical Islamists who are conducting a civilizational war against the West, so that when Dershowitz equates the nationalistic Yasir Arafat with the apocalyptic Osama bin Laden, he distorts more than he informs. No one worries about Arafat blowing up the Sistine Chapel. Washington may actually find it useful to work with some terrorists against the greater threat. It wouldn't be the first time that the United States set a thief to catch a thief: the criminal Stalin was our ally against the criminal Hitler. Even now, as Iran has fomented strife between the Israelis and the Palestinians, it has proved helpful in America's battle against the Taliban.","2809":"His arrest, coming at the same time as those of five American citizens of Yemeni descent in Buffalo, also provides a lift to the government's counterterrorism operation, which has often been criticized in the last year for its inability to penetrate Al Qaeda or determine whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead.","2810":"Mr. Bakri's sister added that he had gone to Pakistan not to join Al Qaeda, but to study religion and to see what it was like living there. She said that he did not like it in Pakistan and that he had spoken of his disdain for Osama bin Laden.","2811":"If the apparently newsworthy interview got off-handed treatment initially, consider the source. The journalist, Yosri Fouda, works for Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network that has been Al Qaeda's news organization of choice. The same network last week was also broadcasting the latest Al Qaeda-produced video, which featured Osama bin Laden's voice offering a hagiographic tribute to the 19 hijackers.","2812":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16\u2014 The six men from western New York who have been accused of having ties to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network are being prosecuted under a broadly worded 1996 law that the Justice Department has depended on in several recent cases and that at least one federal judge has described as unconstitutional.","2813":"Mr. Bashir is an unapologetic admirer of Osama bin Laden, and easily expresses a loathing of American leaders and Jews. But he has steadfastly denied involvement in any terrorist activities.","2814":"Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is a Saudi of Yemeni descent, as were many of the Sept. 11 hijackers.","2815":"The emir started a satellite television channel, Al Jazeera, which is widely watched in the Arab world and beyond for its unrestrained reporting on Arab issues. It is Al Jazeera that has been a source of several tapes from Osama bin Laden.","2816":"A federal prosecutor asked a federal judge yesterday to rule that when Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a reputed official of Al Qaeda, stabbed a jail guard in late 2000, the act was related to terrorism and made Mr. Salim liable for a term of life imprisonment. The prosecutor, Robert Buehler, said that Mr. Salim, 44, who is accused of being a top aide to Osama bin Laden, was trying to take hostages and win the release of other terrorism suspects when he stabbed the guard. If the judge does not agree, Mr. Salim, who has pleaded guilty to the stabbing, could receive 14 to 17 years. His lawyer, Richard B. Lind, said that Mr. Salim never made hostage demands or sought to free other prisoners. Benjamin Weiser (NYT)","2817":"Osama bin Laden himself appeared at the camp while the Lackawanna men were training, the affidavit says, and made a speech 'espousing anti-United States and Israel sentiments.'","2818":"In September 1998, intelligence agencies obtained information warning that Osama bin Laden's next major operation could involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into an American airport and then detonating it. That same fall, another intelligence report stated that there was a Qaeda plot in the works that involved the use of aircraft in both New York and Washington.","2819":"The initial findings of a Congressional committee that has been reviewing the performance of America's intelligence agencies before Sept. 11 are profoundly disturbing. While the investigation has not found that the agencies collected information pointing to the date and targets of the attacks, it has discovered reports that Osama bin Laden and his followers hoped to hit sites in the United States and that they might employ commercial airliners as weapons. The response of spy organizations -- and the government at large -- was anemic.","2820":"Mr. Salim, a Sudanese engineer and longtime associate of Osama bin Laden, set up the company in Istanbul in November 1996 at a time when Al Qaeda was expanding its financial reach from Afghanistan and Sudan into Europe. In the incorporation statement filed with the Turkish authorities, Mr. Salim said Maram would be involved in travel and in imports and exports.","2821":"Their arrest, following a tipoff to American military police, prompted immediate concerns that the couple was working on behalf of Al Qaeda, in part because a picture of Osama bin Laden was found in their apartment.","2822":"BUFFALO, Sept. 18\u2014 The government said today that soon after four of the seven men charged here as a cell of Al Qaeda arrived in Pakistan in the spring of 2001, supposedly for religious education, they were told 'you are going to meet the most wanted one,' meaning Osama bin Laden.","2823":"In addition, the Central Intelligence Agency issued a statement disputing other aspects of the committee's report, intensifying a battle between the intelligence community and the Congressional investigators examining the Sept. 11 failures. A C.I.A. spokesman, Bill Harlow, said that the joint committee report had badly undercounted the number of analysts and other resources that the agency had devoted to tracking Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda before the Sept. 11 attacks.","2824":"The judge in the case, Leonie M. Brinkema, has refused to make public several court filings made in recent weeks by Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French citizen who has acknowledged that he is a Qaeda member loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2825":"Most centrally, the government has charged that the men's mere attendance at a notorious Qaeda camp, where Osama bin Laden himself spoke to the trainees about jihad, violated a 1996 federal law against providing 'material support or resources' for terrorists.","2826":"That statement may strike you as strange: wasn't the tax cut George W. Bush's central achievement before Osama bin Laden came along? But the tax cut was never intended as an economic policy: it was a political gesture designed to ward off a challenge from Steve Forbes and satisfy the conservative base. Only later did the administration make the providential discovery that it was also just the thing to fight recession, promote family values and cure the common cold.","2827":"The government, based on what it says are the statements of two of the men, says the men received training in terrorism and were witness to a speech by Osama bin Laden.","2828":"Saudi Arabia's connection to the Sept. 11 attacks has been a subject of intense investigation since it was learned last year that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens. The Saudi government has long distanced itself from Osama bin Laden, the son of a Yemen-born Saudi construction magnate, but United States officials are concerned about wealthy Saudis who have contributed millions of dollars to radical Islamist causes.","2829":"Mr. Faruq told his C.I.A. interrogators that when he arrived in Indonesia in 1998, having been sent by a top aide to Osama bin Laden, he linked up with Agus Dwikarna, an Indonesian businessman and member of Jemaah Islamiyah. He helped Mr. Dwikarna set up an organization, Laskar Jundullah, which carried out attacks on Christians in Sulawesi, intelligence officials said.","2832":"Yemen appears anxious to shake off its reputation as a haven for Islamic militants and has said it is holding 85 people arrested in a manhunt for members of Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden.","2833":"Over the last four decades of her life, Jordan focused her energies on the problem of violence in Lebanon and Northern Ireland, war crimes in the Balkans, apartheid in South Africa and, many years before Osama bin Laden prompted this country to care much about Afghan politics, the situation of women in Afghanistan. 'All my life I've been studying revolution,' Jordan wrote in 'Nicaragua: Why I Had to Go There,' her account of her travels through Nicaragua after the Sandinista-led revolution in 1979. 'I've been looking for it, pushing at the possibilities and waiting for that moment when there's no more room for rhetoric, for research or for reason: when there's only my life or my death left to act upon.' Jordan's untamed energy and take-no-prisoners attitude served her well as an activist. They have served her less well as an essayist, as shown by her last book, 'Some of Us Did Not Die.'","2835":"Next to Osama bin Laden, Mr. Mohammed is probably the most wanted terrorist in the world, because of what officials believe is his central role in the Sept. 11 plot and in Qaeda operations today. American intelligence officials say he has emerged as Al Qaeda's new chief of operations, succeeding Abu Zubaydah, who was captured in Pakistan in March and is in United States custody.","2837":"A satellite channel that has run tapes from Osama bin Laden and given sympathetic coverage to the Palestinians, Al Jazeera is also well placed geographically to outpace the Western networks on regional war coverage.","2838":"Mr. Bashir steadfastly denies a role in any terrorist activities, though expressing admiration for Osama bin Laden, who he says is not a terrorist.","2839":"Mr. Williams's July memo primarily focused on one individual who was a member of al-Muhajiroun, a group whose spiritual leader was a supporter of Osama bin Laden, the Congressional report stated. The group's spiritual leader had issued several fatwas, or religious decrees, against the United States, including 'one mentioning airports as a possible target,' the report said.","2840":"Mr. Moussaoui, a 34-year-old French national of Moroccan descent, has acknowledged that he is a member of the terrorism network of Al Qaeda and loyal to Osama bin Laden.","2841":"WASHINGTON, Sept. 24\u2014 President Bush ordered the country's terror alert level lowered to Code Yellow today for several factors cited by government officials. These include the disruption of a group near Buffalo whose members are accused of being in Al Qaeda and the capture of followers of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Singapore and Yemen.","2842":"At the end of his column, Minority Report, which will be in the issue that is mailed to subscribers this week, Mr. Hitchens writes: 'When I began work for The Nation over two decades ago, Victor Navasky described the magazine as a debating ground between liberals and radicals, which was, I thought, well judged. In the past few weeks, though, I have come to realize that the magazine itself takes a side in this argument, and is becoming the voice and the echo chamber of those who truly believe that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden.'","2843":"Although Mr. Moussaoui, 34, a French national, has admitted that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks.","2844":"During an animated discussion in the cool of an air-conditioned classroom on the desert campus here of the United Arab Emirates University, Thamina al-Sheraifi, 22, summed up: 'The war will create the same thing as Sept. 11. It will create more Osama bin Ladens. America didn't learn from Sept. 11. They can't understand that what happened is because of their ugly policies in this region.'","2847":"He also disagrees with many scholars and commentators -- Fouad Ajami, Olivier Roy and this reviewer, among others -- who have argued that the militant Islamic trend represented by Osama bin Laden has crested, at least in most Arab lands. On the contrary, he says, Islamism has been 'on the ascendant for a full quarter-century,' and is becoming ever more so.","2848":"With the uncertainties surrounding Osama bin Laden since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States -- whether he is alive or dead, in Afghanistan or Pakistan, or perhaps in some hide-out much farther afield -- this much is known: The last sightings of the leader of Al Qaeda of which pursuers can be reasonably certain were here in the White Mountains of southeastern Afghanistan.","2849":"In the years since, opposition to secular regimes has remained central to Islamist thinking. What has changed is the radicals' strategy for toppling these governments. After decades in which jihadists were defeated by security services in their home countries, Osama bin Laden and his followers decided that they would attack the 'far enemy,' the United States, which they believe is the primary source of strength for the secularist regimes in the Arab world. If the United States withdrew its support, the 'near enemy' that holds power in Muslim capitals would be unable to defend itself.","2850":"Mullah Omar was the leader of the Taliban movement, which swept to power in the mid-1990's and provided sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2851":"Mr. Moussaoui, 34, a Frenchman, has acknowledged that he is a member of Al Qaeda and that he is loyal to Osama bin Laden. But he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks.","2852":"The uncertainty about Osama bin Laden is the best possible outcome for the United States. Resolving this uncertainty in either direction is likely to make things worse.","2853":"Mr. Brody, 49, does not think the United States, as in the case of Osama bin Laden or Saddam Hussein, should try to administer frontier justice. It is better, he insists, to work through world consensus and support the new International Criminal Court and the establishment of war-crimes tribunals.","2854":"'I think people would agree that New York City services for schools, libraries, police, even water and highways should not suffer because of Osama bin Laden,' Ms. Maloney said in a statement.","2855":"When Mr. Bratton was not at home or at the theater or movies in New York, the odds were good that at some point in the evening he would end up at Elaine's with friends. One was his former spokesman, John Miller, a television reporter who once chased John Gotti through town with a microphone and then chased down Osama bin Laden in the barren hills of Afghanistan.","2856":"When the bombs fall on Baghdad, as it seems increasingly likely they will, it will not be because Saddam Hussein is an evil man, but because we could not find Osama bin Laden. That is not pre-emption. It is aggression.","2858":"ALEXANDRIA, Va., Oct. 4\u2014 John Walker Lindh, the American who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, was sentenced to 20 years in prison today after sobbing through a 14-minute statement in which he repudiated terrorism, condemned Osama bin Laden and tried to explain why he joined the Afghan movement. But he stopped short of apologizing for anything other than causing his family so much pain.","2859":"'I am a member of Al Qaeda and I pledged to Osama bin Laden,' Mr. Reid, 29, a Briton, told Judge William G. Young in Federal District Court here. 'I am an enemy of your country.'","2860":"John Walker Lindh, the American who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after reading a 14-minute statement in which he repudiated terrorism, condemned Osama bin Laden and tried to explain why he joined the Afghan movement. A1","2862":"John Walker Lindh, the American who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, was sentenced in Virginia to 20 years in prison. In his statement, he repudiated terrorism and condemned Osama bin Laden, but did not apologize for his actions.","2864":"Even now, most people consider human will indispensable for any muscular definition of evil. The case for this position was restated eloquently by Ron Rosenbaum in a recent article in The Atlantic Monthly about degrees of evil. If we're going to avoid the foolish complacency of moral relativism, Rosenbaum said, then we must see Osama bin Laden as fully conscious of his wickedness, not deluded by the belief that he was doing good. Otherwise we'd have to exonerate him. 'If we don't believe in ordinary, knowing wickedness,' Rosenbaum wrote, 'we can't condemn Hitler for anything more than a well-meaning ideological mistake or bin Laden for anything more than a well-meaning religious mistake.'","2865":"The campaign, which has also involved efforts to recruit the suspects' friends and family members as government informers, has raised alarm from civil liberties groups and some Arab-American and Muslim leaders. The men are suspected of ties to Al Qaeda or other groups affiliated with Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.","2866":"Based on the statements of two of the men, the government says they received training in terrorism and heard a speech by Osama bin Laden.","2867":"It is quite a change. For three years, bearded fighters from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan descended during thaws to skirmish with government soldiers. It was Central Asia's largest militant group, financed by Osama bin Laden, given refuge in Afghanistan by the Taliban and included on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations. Its incursions, and the accusation that it was behind an assassination attempt on the Uzbek president, Islam Karimov, in 1999, ensured that it was studied for signs that the brand of Islam used by the Taliban might spread.","2868":"Photo: One year after the United States started bombing in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, left, with Gen. Peter Pace of the Marines, vowed yesterday that Osama bin Laden and associates would be found. (Reuters)","2870":"As so many people seem to have done here in the suburbs in the last few days, Ms. Jacobs said she found herself thinking about the sniper in the same sometimes furious, sometimes frightened way she has thought of Osama bin Laden.","2871":"And, the judge said, the evidence of the young men's presence at the Qaeda camp in Afghanistan raised several questions: Were they recruited? How did they get into Afghanistan if their passports showed no visas or stamps? How did they enter the secret training camp and hear a speech by Osama bin Laden? And what, asked the judge, was their 'objective in attending said training camp and to what use or purpose was such training to be put?'","2872":"Mr. Freeh replied: 'Absolutely. In 1999, not only had we indicted Osama bin Laden twice, he was on our Top 10 list. Al Qaeda was the No. 1 priority.'","2873":"The audacity of the crusade's ambitions is matched by the magnitude of its risks. Before Sept. 11, the Islamist radicals had been on the run, their project flagging. They had turned their talents on the United States -- the distant power that lay behind the thrones in Riyadh and Cairo -- only after suffering defeat on the primary battlegrounds of Algeria and Egypt and Saudi Arabia. By invading and occupying Iraq and using it as a base to remake the region, the United States risks revitalizing the political project embodied by Osama bin Laden. It is not only that Islamic radicalism may gain new life and new converts but that moderate regimes will be threatened and will respond harshly, leading them not toward democracy but away from it, and that, finally, the force to which the United States remains most vulnerable -- terror -- will once again visit our shores. And this time, terror may come not just from a reanimated Al Qaeda but from Hezbollah and other groups that heretofore saw the American threat as not quite so direct. To divide the world into good and evil, however effective that is as a means of building political support and however gratifying that may be to Americans who see their country as a 'city on a hill,' risks broadening a war that would be better kept narrowly defined.","2874":"The question before him was whether to keep six men from nearby Lackawanna behind bars until their trial on charges of supporting Al Qaeda by attending an Afghanistan training camp months before the Sept. 11 attack. The judge was on fresh terrain, negotiating between the lack of evidence that the men were planning an attack and the question of why young Americans of Yemeni descent wound up in the clutches, if only for a moment, of Osama bin Laden.","2875":"The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it did not have 'information on a specific time, date or location of an attack' but said the warning was prompted by threats contained in audio tapes of two leaders of Al Qaeda broadcast in recent days. In one of the tapes, broadcast on Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based Arabic language satellite television network, Osama bin Laden's chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatened attacks on the United States economy.","2876":"The protesters rallied as Attorney General John Ashcroft held a news conference inside the building to announce the seven-count indictment, which accuses Enaam M. Arnaout, 40, of money laundering, fraud and conspiracy to engage in racketeering as executive director of the charity, the Benevolence International Foundation, based in Chicago. Mr. Arnaout has been in federal custody here since April, charged with perjury in lying about ties to Osama bin Laden.","2877":"'It's like my heart is on fire,' Mrs. Akel said as she contemplated the accelerating cycle of violence. She sat on a flowered cushion among a crowd of grandchildren in the family home here, its walls plastered with pictures of the dead, including her son; of Osama bin Laden, and of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas.","2879":"The man, Enaam M. Arnaout, 40, a father of four from suburban Chicago, faces up to 90 years in prison if convicted on the seven counts in the federal indictment, which alleges that his charity, the Benevolence International Foundation, was a financial front for Osama bin Laden's terrorist activities.","2880":"LOS ANGELES\u2014 On Wednesday, the government indicted Enaam M. Arnaout, the leader of the Benevolence International Foundation, a prominent Muslim charity, on charges that he helped finance Osama bin Laden's terrorist activities.","2881":"The F.B.I. said the warning, transmitted to state and local law enforcement agencies, was prompted by threats contained in recently broadcast recorded statements by Osama bin Laden and his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. When the bin Laden statement was taped is not known, but F.B.I. officials said they believed Mr. Zawahiri's tape was made in recent weeks.","2882":"Those questions have grown more urgent with the recent assaults against American marines in Kuwait and the release of audio tapes attributed to Osama bin Laden and one of his chief lieutenants, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Mr. Zawahiri's tape, which officials said was more likely to be genuine and recently made than the bin Laden tape, threatens new attacks against the United States and couches its anti-American message around the possibility of an American-led war against Iraq.","2883":"This exchange is followed by a montage, accompanied by Louis Armstrong singing 'What a Wonderful World,' of American foreign policy misdeeds from the 1950's to the present. Their relevance is, again, arguable, but by now it should be clear that Mr. Moore is less interested in argument than in provocation. The last image is of the airplanes smashing into the World Trade Center, accompanied by this text: 'Sept. 11, 2001: Osama bin Laden uses his expert C.I.A. training to murder 3,000 people.'","2884":"The combination of those forces is apparently what drove two young Kuwaiti men to a suicidal attack this week that killed one American marine and wounded another. Kuwaiti government officials say the assault was carried out with the help of other militants who were also planning a larger attack. Several of those people are now in custody; it is not yet clear whether they have direct links to Al Qaeda, the terrorist network of Osama bin Laden.","2885":"A total of 15 people have been charged with aiding the attack, led by Anas Ahmad Ibrahim al-Kandari. Mr. Kandari, 21, who was killed with his cousin in the attack, had said in a videotaped message that he had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, the Kuwaiti minister said.","2886":"No, like Osama bin Laden, this shooter seems to get his thrills from seeing the fear in the eyes of the survivors -- after he randomly kills his victims as if they were deer. And like bin Laden, this shooter is a loser who combines evil, cunning, technical prowess, a world stage and a willingness to kill everyday people doing everyday things to magnify that fear. By gunning down people pumping gas, mowing lawns and walking to school, the shooter is making America's capital area squirm. That's power. No wonder the note he apparently left said, 'I am God.'","2887":"Plenty of problems persist. Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, may or may not still be alive, and Mullah Mohammed Omar, the former head of the Taliban, remains at large. Efforts to train a new multi-ethnic Afghan national army that would bolster the central government's authority in lawless regions of the country have taken longer than expected. Regional warlords are feuding, posing new challenges to President Hamid Karzai's government. Aid has been slow to reach many parts of the country.","2888":"The group's latest round of attacks may be a response to the Bush administration's Iraq policy, the officials said. An audiotape of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatened continued attacks on 'America and its allies,' and denounced American plans to attack Iraq.","2889":"In the name of those objectives, the American people would most likely be willing to pay billions of dollars a year, as long as it seems that American soil is secure from the likes of Osama bin Laden. We should not forget that the United States has a long history of military occupation in the Caribbean and Central America in the name of democracy and stability in the region. Why should Iraq and the Middle East be any different?","2890":"Enamm M. Arnaout, a Syrian-born Chicago resident, was so close to Osama bin Laden in the late 1980's, F.B.I. officials say, that he once looked after one of his wives. Mr. Aranout's alleged links to Al Qaeda led to his indictment, which alleged that as the leader of an Islamic foundation, he diverted money to Al Qaeda. Lawyers for Mr. Arnaout called the charges baseless. Eric Lichtblau","2891":"MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md.\u2014 In the endless media psychoanalysis and police profiling of the random murderer striking fear near the nation's capital, one possibility is rarely mentioned: that the sniper may be a terrorist affiliated with Al Qaeda or otherwise inspired by Osama bin Laden.","2892":"When Australian troops were in East Timor, which is predominately Christian, in support of that country's transition to independence from Indonesia, Osama bin Laden, the Qaeda leader, publicly accused Australia of being on a crusade to break up Muslim Indonesia.","2893":"For years Al Qaeda aligned itself with other militant groups, providing training and sometimes financing and planning. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden established the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, which trained at least 10,000 potential fighters in eastern Afghanistan.","2894":"Unfortunately, there are many others who applaud Osama bin Laden for having the guts to take on the infidels. The suspicion and hostility we face in the Islamic world will be one of our central challenges in the coming years, particularly after any invasion of Iraq. Look at Pakistan, our supposed ally in the war on terrorism. The most common name given to Pakistani boys born after 9/11 in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province reportedly was Osama -- that's right, Osama.","2895":"This was the latest and deadliest of several recent assaults. Together they offer evidence that Al Qaeda and its allies have survived the war in Afghanistan and are regrouping to organize new strikes. Two weeks ago Kuwaiti terrorists opened fire on American marines who were in the country for joint exercises with the Kuwaiti military, killing one of them. One of the assailants left behind a tape pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Yesterday more gunfire was directed at American troops in Kuwait. Late last month a French oil tanker was set ablaze off Yemen in what Paris believes was a terrorist attack. Meanwhile a new tape by Osama bin Laden's top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has begun circulating. American authorities believe it was recorded recently.","2896":"The president said that the attacks showed once again that the campaign against terrorism would be a protracted one, and that his administration had a long struggle ahead. The president said that he did not know whether Osama bin Laden was dead or alive but that he did know that 'there are still some of his top lieutenants roaming around' and that Al Qaeda remains dangerous.","2897":"KUWAIT, Oct. 14\u2014 Gunmen fired at American marines in northern Kuwait early today, the United States Embassy here said, less than a week after a marine was killed in an attack here by a man professing allegiance to Osama bin Laden.","2898":"The man was turned over to Sudanese authorities at Khartoum airport. Sudanese television showed images of passengers leaving the jetliner by inflatable emergency slides. The Interior Ministry said the plane was swept for explosives and given permission to resume its journey. The attempted hijacking of a Saudi Arabian plane raised more than the usual interest because the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia has been strongly denounced by religious conservatives in the Islamic world, as well as by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi citizen who lived in Sudan in the 1990's before being expelled and moving to Afghanistan. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were from Saudi Arabia.","2899":"With so little known about the gunman, the experts say, it is possible he may have some political agenda. Moreover, the killings have aroused precisely the kind of anxiety that many people equate with terrorist acts. The shootings have also occurred at the same time as a surge in violence associated with Islamic extremism and Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network.","2900":"Sometimes he posted queries on topics like manufacturing nerve gas at home. Once, he shared the results of an experiment with a highly volatile explosive that he set off in a metal breath-mint box. Often he traded information with the site's moderator, who used the screen name Einstein and whose message carried a picture of his own face superimposed on Osama bin Laden's body, complete with turban and beard.","2901":"In another abrupt about-face, Mr. Yudhoyono conceded that the organization's leader is Abu Bakar Bashir, a 64-year-old preacher who runs an Islamic boarding school in central Java. Mr. Bashir, who expresses admiration for Osama bin Laden and loathing for Jews and the West, has steadfastly denied that there is any such group as Jemaah Islamiyah.","2902":"Despite the lapses, the C.I.A. director insisted that his agency had long been aware of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden's terror network. He said that with the creation of the agency's bin Laden 'issue station' in 1996, the C.I.A. had been engaged in a sustained, high-priority effort to disrupt Al Qaeda.","2903":"Mr. Moussaoui, 34, of France, was indicted in December in Alexandria, Va., near the Pentagon, on federal terrorism charges and is awaiting trial. Although he has acknowledged in court that he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, he has insisted he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 conspiracy.","2904":"A declared admirer of Osama bin Laden, Mr. Bashir said tonight that he was aware of reports that he was to be questioned. In a telephone interview, he said, laughingly, that there were no police at his house yet.","2905":"Yemen, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, has been trying to shed its image as a haven for Islamic militants since 17 United States servicemen were killed in the suicide bombing of the destroyer Cole in Aden Harbor in October 2000.","2906":"With his customary confidence, Mr. Bashir, 64, who is an unabashed admirer of Osama bin Laden, said at a news conference in Solo this afternoon that he would go to Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, as requested. He appeared as strong as ever when he delivered his standard tirades. 'The Americans and Jews are the terrorists,' he said.","2907":"'Just like resources have been made available for fighting Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, we want the same thing available for the citizens in Baltimore City,' Mr. McFadden said. 'We consider this an absolute terrorist attack on the community.'","2908":"A year ago, most Americans thought they knew what Al Qaeda was: an organization led by Osama bin Laden pursuing a vague Islamic ideology, with a base and training camps in Afghanistan and cells of operatives around the globe. The cells were thought to operate either on signals from the top or to some extent on their own initiative.","2909":"BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 19\u2014 An Iraqi official who is part of President Saddam Hussein's inner circle has said the government has had no links with Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, denying a charge made by President Bush.","2910":"Muslim outrage could also make it much more difficult to keep the nuclear materials now in Pakistan out of terrorist hands. The Pakistani public has been encouraged to consider its nuclear weapons 'Islamic bombs.' President Pervez Musharraf seems to be making a serious effort to bring Islamic fanatics under control, but most likely their sympathizers still infest his government. Even a successful invasion of Iraq could have the perverse effect of increasing the threat we had tried to eliminate. While Saddam Hussein can, with determined effort, be deterred, Osama bin Laden and his like cannot.","2911":"If they line up with the Bush administration against Saddam Hussein, they risk alienating a large and volatile domestic constituency, with unpredictable consequences. (Witness this month's elections in Pakistan, where two provinces adjacent to Afghanistan are now controlled by a coalition of religious parties sympathetic to Osama bin Laden.) But if they acknowledge popular opposition to a war with Iraq, they will incur Mr. Bush's wrath. Either way the war on terror suffers.","2913":"Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and part of Saddam Hussein's inner circle, said the Iraqi government has had no links with Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, denying a charge made by President Bush. 13","2914":"The ease with which one can buy weapons at gun shows has not gone unnoticed by groups like Al Qaeda, which pointed this out in one of its training manuals. According to the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy group, Osama bin Laden's agents in the United States purchased 25 high-powered sniper rifles to use in their war against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the late 1980's. What would stop them from using the guns against us at home?","2915":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia\u2014 Osama bin Laden succeeded magnificently, it seems, in at least one of his goals: creating a rift between the United States and Saudi Arabia.","2916":"The government, on the basis of what it said were the statements of two of the men, said the men had received training in terrorism and had witnessed a speech by Osama bin Laden.","2917":"Mr. Moussaoui has said he is a member of Al Qaeda and is loyal to Osama bin Laden, but he has insisted that he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks. He was arrested on immigration charges in August 2001 in Minnesota after arousing the suspicion of his instructors at a flight school.","2918":"This is an important distinction. The 'Arab street' is the broad mass of public opinion, which is largely passive and nonviolent. The 'Arab basement' is where small groups of hard-core ideologues, such as Osama bin Laden and his gang, have retreated and where they are mixing fertilizer, C-4 plastic explosives and gasoline to make the bombs that have killed Westerners all over the world.","2919":"Osama bin Laden, whose family's roots lie in Yemen, attracted many followers from this country. After the Taliban and Al Qaeda were routed, it was believed many would seek refuge in Yemen -- not least because Mr. bin Laden suggested they would all be welcome here.","2920":"The most contentious exchange came when the moderator, Tim Russert, host of NBC's 'Meet the Press,' asked Mr. McBride if he condemned remarks by a prominent Miami minister and McBride supporter comparing the Bush family to Osama bin Laden and neo-Nazis. Mr. McBride said he did condemn the remarks by the Rev. Victor Curry, president of the Miami N.A.A.C.P., but Governor Bush suggested that the condemnation did not go far enough.","2921":"This does not mean that Al Qaeda and Iraq have not had contacts or even collaborated over the past 5 or 10 years. Both hate America. And despite the fact that their ideologies are mutually antagonistic -- Mr. Hussein's regime is based on notions of secular Arab nationalism that Osama bin Laden detests -- they have much in common and are clearly capable of putting aside their differences for tactical ends.","2922":"Mounir el-Motassadeq, a man accused by German prosecutors of being a member of Mohamed Atta's terrorist cell, reversed his earlier claims and admitted that he had attended a training camp sponsored by Osama bin Laden. But he pleaded not guilty to charges that included accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people and denied that he was a member of Al Qaeda.

In addition, the view among even some senior intelligence analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency is that Mr. Hussein is contained and is unlikely to unleash weapons of mass destruction unless he is attacked.","2925":"American officials insist they know of no evidence to support the suit's principle accusations, including its charge that Prince Sultan 'publicly supported and funded several Islamic charities that were sponsoring Osama bin Laden.'","2926":"LONDON, Oct. 25\u2014 The British authorities were reported today to have arrested a fugitive Islamic cleric known as Abu Qatada, wanted in the United States and Europe as an emissary of Osama bin Laden and labeled by a British legislator 'some sort of Muslim Scarlet Pimpernel.'","2927":"The British authorities are reported to have arrested a fugitive Islamic cleric, wanted in the United States and Europe as an emissary of Osama bin Laden.

One of Mr. Chambliss's more provocative advertisements, which he revised after a storm of criticism, even flashed pictures of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein before snapshots of Mr. Cleland, to make sure no one missed the point.","2937":"Thomas L. Friedman says the 'Arab basement' -- 'hard-core ideologues, such as Osama bin Laden and his gang' -- doesn't want Israel to exist (column, Oct. 23). He need not have limited this to those in the 'basement.' The children of Palestinians are taught by their schools and media to hate Israelis. Israel is absent on many of their maps.","2938":"The international war against terrorism, and strong evidence that some Chechen rebels have received training and support from Al Qaeda, has emboldened Mr. Putin to equate his struggle against the guerrillas with America's campaign against Osama bin Laden and his followers. While there are common elements, the Chechens have some legitimate grievances about a long history of harsh Russian rule. Mr. Putin should recognize that he cannot end their insurrection through force alone. If the United States wants to be helpful, it should not give Mr. Putin a pat on the back after this debacle and tell him we are all fighting the same enemy.","2939":"The Web site began operating three years ago in Doha, Qatar, where its technical and corporate offices are located. Qatar's leader, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, has made efforts to create a more open, liberal atmosphere. Another prominent result of that openness is Al Jazeera television, which has broadcast messages by Osama bin Laden and his confederates, and has drawn criticism from governments across the Arab world for its outspoken ways. The Qatari royal family, which finances Al Jazeera, is a major supporter of the Web site, according to its deputy editor, Hossam el-Din el-Sayed.","2940":"President Mohammad Khatami of Iran said that his country opposed a war against Iraq and contended that a misguided campaign against terrorism by the United States had strenghtened support for Osama bin Laden in the Muslim world.

The White House has argued in part that the videos may contain hidden information for terrorists in hiding.","2946":"There is a scene in this important book that tells a great deal about the failure of the American government to prevent the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In 1999, a National Security Council staffer was meeting with a pair of F.B.I. officials at the White House. The N.S.C. man was excited and surprised to learn from some old press clippings that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the much-feared Egyptian terrorist and deputy to Osama bin Laden, had visited the United States on a fund-raising trip in the early 1990's. 'I couldn't believe it,' he exclaimed to the F.B.I. men. 'Did you know that?' The two gumshoes nodded warily. 'Well,' the staffer continued, 'if he was here, someone was handling his travel and arranging his meetings and someone was giving him money. Do you know who these people are? Do you have them covered? There are cells here and we need to know about them.' 'Yeah, yeah, we know. Don't worry about it,' the F.B.I. officials replied.","2947":"When the C.I.A. failed to find any significant link between Osama bin Laden's Qaeda network and Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, the Pentagon set up a competing intelligence unit this fall under Douglas J. Feith, under secretary for policy. It trolls through millions of intelligence reports for nuggets to show that Iraq might be connected to the Sept. 11 attacks.","2948":"One of the most provocative commercials flashed pictures of Osama bin Laden and then blasted Mr. Cleland, 60, for voting against the president 11 times on domestic security.","2949":"Mr. Grucci tried to paint Mr. Bishop, 52, who is on leave from Southampton College, as the beneficiary of wealthy special interests, but he lost some of his incumbent's advantage when he ran commercials that accused Mr. Bishop of covering up rapes of students at Southampton, and of opposing the execution of Osama bin Laden. The advertising backfired.","2950":"Last November, a Predator operated by the C.I.A. was used to coordinate a strike in which one of Osama bin Laden's closest lieutenants, Muhammad Atef, was killed in Kabul.","2951":"'Pakistan' is a valuable and information-rich, if also ramshackle and meandering, portrait of a poor and deeply divided country that, she says, could very well become the next of the world's failed states -- like Egypt, the subject of her previous book. The main thrust of Ms. Weaver's account, as her subtitle suggests, is to illustrate the ways in which Pakistan has been changed by the decade-long war fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the rise of the militant Islamic groups fighting jihad, or holy war, Osama bin Laden's Qaeda and the recently deposed Afghan Taliban among them. Ms. Weaver's findings are not surprising, but they are worthy of attention because of Pakistan's special circumstances.","2952":"'Yasir Arafat' and the revived best seller from last year, 'Osama bin Laden,' were already all but gone -- a reflection that the plight of the Palestinians and the fight against terrorism remain the preoccupations of the moment.","2953":"His central theme is that Wahhabism has over the centuries waged a bitter struggle against all other variants of Islam, most particularly the tolerant, peaceful, poetically mystical schools of thought that, in Mr. Schwartz's view, are the true and admirable historic Islam. Moreover, he maintains that Wahhabism, which gave rise to Osama bin Laden and the Afghan Taliban among others, is the most dread menace faced in the world today by the forces of tolerance and pluralism, whether Muslim or otherwise.","2954":"The group was led by a senior lieutenant of Osama bin Laden and included a Qaeda explosives expert, who was later arrested and told American officials of the January meeting during his interrogation.","2955":"A Western diplomat said tonight that according to Indonesian law enforcement officials, a search of Mr. Amrozi's house had turned up compact discs featuring Osama bin Laden.","2956":"In a two-hour interview at the modest two-story villa in the Baghdad suburb of Zeiyunia that serves as headquarters for his Palestine Liberation Front, an offshoot of Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, Mr. Abbas spoke contemptuously of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.","2957":"Nearly every Democratic leader is offering a variation on Dick Gephardt's excuse -- that 9/11 shrouded the election, to the White House's advantage. But if conservatives are rarely more irritating than when they wrap themselves in the flag, liberals are surely at their most annoying when donning the veil of victimhood. The Democrats were not done in by Osama bin Laden or the media or anyone other than themselves. Their intellectual vacuity in this year's campaign was apparent well before 9/11.","2958":"The first two editions can be found on bookshelves of principals, policy makers and parents around the world, in editions in English, Dutch, German and Swedish. These early versions show their age, though. They are silent on matters like the Internet, Osama bin Laden and global positioning systems, and virtually prelapsarian on the political state of China, national borders and popular music. 'The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy' is every bit as weighty as its progenitors, with more than 600 new entries (for a total of 6,900) and 23 sections, touching on everything from aerobic exercise to H. Ross Perot to Zionism.","2959":"'Don't even look at them,' wrote Ms. Fallaci, who also recommended that Florentines shutter the entire city. She said the protesters were demanding peace from Mr. Bush, but not from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or Osama bin Laden.","2960":"Precautions may well be warranted. On Dec. 14, 1999, United States Customs officials at Port Angeles, Wash., arrested a 32-year-old man who had arrived on a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, after the trunk of his rented car was found to contain 100 pounds of ingredients for bomb-making. The man, Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian, admitted later that he had plotted to set off a bomb at Los Angeles International Airport, and that he had received money and training at camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden.","2961":"Mr. Bush confronts other risks. After nearly two years of attributing the economy's troubles variously to a hangover from the Clinton years, Osama bin Laden, obstructionists in the Democratic Senate and the business cycle, the president will most likely be forced to take full political ownership of the economy.","2962":"Although Mr. Motassadeq has admitted that he knew other alleged cell members and that he spent time at a training camp in Afghanistan sponsored by Osama bin Laden, he denies knowing of any terrorist plans.","2963":"A youngster who committed suicide by crashing into a Tampa office building nearly hit the control tower at an Air Force base with a nerve center for the Afghan war, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot, Charles Bishop, 15, of Palm Harbor, flew his stolen Cessna 'just a few feet' over the control tower at MacDill Air Force Base on Jan. 5, the report by the board said. It did not speculate whether Mr. Bishop, who left a suicide note expressing admiration for Osama bin Laden, had intended the base as his target. The base is home to the Central Command, which has a crucial role in directing combat in Afghanistan. When a Coast Guard helicopter tried to force Mr. Bishop to land, he flew toward Tampa, the report said. Mr. Bishop slammed the four-seat plane into the 28th floor of the Bank of America Plaza. Nobody else was hurt.","2964":"Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network, broadcast an audio tape it said was recorded by Osama bin Laden in which he praised several violent attacks around the world, including recent ones in Moscow and Bali, and threatened further bloodshed over Iraq. A1","2965":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 12\u2014 Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television channel, broadcast an audiotape today that it said was recorded by Osama bin Laden in which he praised several terror attacks around the world, including recent ones in Moscow and Bali, and threatened further bloodshed over Iraq.","2966":"The government's assessment so far that it cannot be absolutely certain that the audiotape broadcast on Tuesday was recorded by Osama bin Laden does not surprise experts in the field of voice authentication.","2967":"Since the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush has focused his attention either on Osama bin Laden or on the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein. Yesterday he had to deal with both at once. Just as experts were asserting that a new tape from Mr. bin Laden appeared to be authentic -- meaning the master terrorist is probably alive and plotting -- Mr. Hussein announced his acceptance of the new United Nations resolution aimed at disarming his regime.","2968":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 13\u2014 The White House has been told that government linguistics experts believe the voice on a new audiotape praising recent terror attacks and broadcast on Arab television is Osama bin Laden's, administration officials said today.","2969":"Administration officials said government linguists believed that a new audiotape broadcast on Arab television contained the voice of Osama bin Laden. But initial analysis by electronics experts could not determine whether the tape was genuine. A1","2970":"LONDON, Nov. 13\u2014 Governments of Western countries named as potential targets of terrorist attacks in an audiotape purporting to contain the voice of Osama bin Laden said today that they were treating the tape's message seriously but that the implication that Mr. bin Laden is alive had not forced them to change security arrangements.","2971":"Following are excerpts from an audiotape broadcast in Arabic this week by Al Jazeera and attributed to Osama bin Laden, as recorded and translated by Reuters.","2973":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 14\u2014 American intelligence agencies came under renewed attack in Congress today for failing to find Osama bin Laden, with the increasing certainty that he is still alive prompting senior Democratic senators to brand the effort to dismantle Al Qaeda as a failure.","2974":"You have to wonder how Osama bin Laden is reacting as he watches our administration scramble after his alleged resurfacing ('As New Tape Is Evaluated, Bush Calls Qaeda Threat Real,' front page, Nov. 14).","2975":"This August, Mr. Elmardoudi was indicted with three other men on a charge of providing support to terrorists and another charge relating to visa fraud. The indictment said the men were part of a terror cell directed by Mr. Elmardoudi, referred to as Abdella in the indictment. Though the indictment against the men drew ideological links to Osama bin Laden, they were not specifically linked to Al Qaeda.","2976":"A chain reaction has been set in motion, giving sanction and inspiration to thousands of Osama bin Laden's followers. We ignore this essential fact at our own peril, and should have been doing more to safeguard our country since that date.","2977":"On Sept. 17, 2001, George W. Bush evoked images of America's frontier justice when he promised that we would get Osama bin Laden 'dead or alive.'","2978":"WASHINGTON\u2014 In past weeks Al Qaeda has relaunched itself, a rebranding that presages a second phase in its war against the West. The clearest evidence for this shift is in three audiotapes that Al Qaeda has released since the beginning of October from its top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri.","2979":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 14\u2014 The audiotape that appears to be Osama bin Laden's latest message to the world was handed over by a man on the street here two days ago, the correspondent for Al Jazeera who received it said.","2980":"Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister, in addressing the French Senate today talked about a threatening audiotape message attributed to Osama bin Laden that mentions France. But he said the police knew of no precise attacks planned against the country.","2981":"American intelligence agencies came under renewed attack in Congress for failing to find Osama bin Laden, with the increasing certainty that he is still alive prompting senior Democratic senators to brand the effort to dismantle Al Qaeda a failure. A1","2982":"He was not, they said, one of the most widely recognized Qaeda leaders -- Osama bin Laden or his senior deputies, Ayman al-Zawahiri or Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.","2983":"He also said he met Osama bin Laden there. 'I love him a lot, like a father,' he said. 'For me, he's my father. I don't care what happened on Sept. 11 or what he did, that doesn't interest me.","2984":"One reason the six-week rally may be slowing is the renewed focus on terrorist attacks since the surfacing of a tape earlier this week attributed to Osama bin Laden. Then on Thursday, the F.B.I. issued a terrorist attack alert that said: 'In selecting its next targets, sources suggest Al Qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria: high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the American economy and maximum psychological trauma.'","2985":"Twice in the past week, George W. Bush has been called 'Pharaoh' in missives from the Middle East. The word was uttered by the voice on an audiotape broadcast by Al Jazeera, which may or may not have been that of Osama bin Laden, and it also appeared in the recent letter from Naji Sabri, the Iraqi foreign minister, to Kofi Annan accepting the return of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq. 'Go thou to Pharaoh,' Mr. Sabri's letter begins, quoting from the Koran, 'for he has indeed transgressed all bounds. But speak to him mildly; perchance he may take warning or fear.' These are the words Allah speaks to Moses and his brother Aaron in the sura, or section, called Ta-Ha. Unlike Mr. Sabri, Allah did not mean these words ironically.","2986":"Moreover, these critics assert, almost three weeks after the slaying of an American diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the government appears to be seeking to reassure the United States that it is serious about crushing any hint of radical Islam. The police say Mr. Foley's death has no connection to the unrest in Maan, but the subject of their manhunt, Muhammad Ahmad al-Chalabi, who is also called Abu Sayyaf, reportedly staged a rally here in support of Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.","2987":"Mr. Fadhli's confession traces a network of Qaeda activity between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Yemen -- a further suggestion that Osama bin Laden's terrorist network remains active across the Arabian Peninsula. Last month, a missile fired from a C.I.A. Predator drone near the noman's land that forms the sketchy Saudi-Yemeni border killed a senior Qaeda leader, Qaed Senyan al-Harthi, a suspect in the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden two years ago, which killed 17 sailors.","2988":"WASHINGTON\u2014 THE shadow of terror reappeared at the nation's door last week, on the very day that Congress was congratulating itself for agreeing in principle to create a Department of Homeland Security. Osama bin Laden was not dead, intelligence analysts said. His voice, it seemed, was on an audiotape praising recent terror attacks and vowing new ones.","2989":"Fourteen months after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, the American people deserve a more effective warning system about possible new assaults than the Chicken Little alerts the Bush administration is providing. Once again last week, Washington, in effect, warned that the sky was falling, and officials did a good imitation of Henny Penny as they analyzed the latest intelligence data about Osama bin Laden. This is no way to conduct the affairs of the most powerful, technologically advanced nation on the planet.","2990":"The government officials who confirmed the outlines of the program did so in an apparent effort to rebut critics in Congress and elsewhere who have complained recently that American intelligence agencies are failing in their war against terror. Senior Democratic senators have said the problems are demonstrated by the government's inability to find Osama bin Laden and to identify specific threats since the Sept. 11 attacks.","2991":"Yemen is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden and the scene of two previous attacks on Western interests -- on the American destroyer Cole in 2000 and on the French tanker Limburg last month.","2992":"The arrests come at a time when Britons are being warned to be increasingly vigilant because of intelligence indicating that Al Qaeda is focusing on a strike on their country. Britain was one of the American allies threatened by name in a tape recording thought to be made by Osama bin Laden that was broadcast last week by Al Jazeera, the Arabic satellite television network.","2993":"He suggested that a newly released six-page statement attributed to Al Qaeda and warning of new terrorist strikes in Washington and New York might well be genuine and that it was 'likely' that Osama bin Laden's voice was the one heard last week on an audiotape threatening new attacks.","2994":"Intelligence officials have concluded that a tape that was broadcast on an Arab television station last week is genuine and that the voice is that of Osama bin Laden.","2995":"United States intelligence officials have concluded that the voice on a recently recorded audiotape broadcast on an Arab television channel last week is that of Osama bin Laden. The conclusion appears to end months of debate within the government. A22","2996":"Fox has many good news reporters, some of them lured away from CNN, but its news division is often held to a looser standard than that at other news organizations. The Fox News decision to send Geraldo Rivera to Afghanistan last year to track down Osama bin Laden was a national joke, but the press criticism was not nearly as sanctimonious as that directed at MSNBC for sending the inexperienced, if photogenic, Ashleigh Banfield to the same war zone.","2997":"WASHINGTON, Nov. 18\u2014 United States intelligence officials have concluded that a recently recorded audiotape that was broadcast on an Arab television network last week is genuine and contains the voice of Osama bin Laden, apparently ending months of debate in the government over whether the elusive terrorist leader is still alive.","2998":"'Osama bin Laden is still alive and plotting more attacks while we play bureaucratic shuffleboard.'","2999":"'Osama bin Laden is still alive and plotting more attacks while we play bureaucratic shuffleboard.'","3000":"Mr. Hill is an important source for this book, which began as an article in The New Yorker. (It still has the diligent, data-gathering tone of a magazine story, much expanded.) And Mr. Hill, who was such a good shot that he could hit an aspirin with a BB gun, contributes a compelling personal history of his own. He was drawn to the Koran after his Vietnam days and took the name Abdullah al-Amin. He traveled to Afghanistan under that name in 1987, as an anti-Russian soldier of fortune. He urged Mr. Rescorla to join him in a plan to assassinate Osama bin Laden after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing."}
